| 0:01:26| And read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=86)|

| 0:02:01| Or is there anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| No, this is simply following state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| In case we have another instance for the law director, there's a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=126)|

| 0:07:02| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| We have 16 commissioners that are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Clerk, would you read into the record what we're the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| This is a discussion of the fiscal year 2010 through 2011 proposed Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=438)|
| 0:07:29| Mr. Chairman, last month at the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| we sort of talked about instead of the way we had been doing our budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=455)|
| 0:07:43| instead of just having all the department heads come down here and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| we're pleased or not pleased with the amount that they've been allocated within the mayor's proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| we thought it might be best to allow commissioners to bring forth any questions or concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=474)|
| 0:08:02| so that these could be discussed at an open forum and not tie up the department heads all day long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=482)|
| 0:08:10| and that we might be able to get more done that way and then to come back tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| and maybe have some of the department heads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| I believe that seemed to be the crust of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| And I just wanted to let you know what we did last month since you weren't able to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| and then you can throw it out to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Are we ready to begin asking questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| On the discussion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| I have a number of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| I'd like to talk about revenues if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| I know that there was a report from the state saying that sales tax revenues had increased $51 million last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| That's a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| I know that in my business, for the first four months of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| we have seen advertising revenues increase monthly by an average of five to seven percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Again, a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Are you satisfied with the sales tax figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Do you think that perhaps there could be an increase in sales tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| given the fact that we are starting to see positive indicators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| We are, and I think that's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Last month we were glad to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| or glad to see the reports that the county was up half a percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| and we were celebrating that this was the first time in a while that we were up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| and then that was followed up with the current month we're up five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| And so that's two months in a row the county is up in sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and I think that's a great indicator and I hope that it's a trend and we continue to watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| Now, in terms of dollars, that five percent, what does that mean in terms of dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| It was about a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| So, previous month you said it was half a percent and up five percent and that was for April or March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=594)|

| 0:10:02| April and May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| So, yeah, we're seeing some positive indicators and it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Sorry, I think it is March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| March and April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| We wouldn't have Mays yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| We're not all the way through May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Yeah, and I guess it just depends on how you describe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| It's what we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| We get notification from the state in May, but it's about the previous month's collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| So, what you have projected as far as sales tax revenues, did you take into account the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| that it could be a three to five percent increase this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| No, it's not quite that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| It's more in the neighborhood of one and a half plus percent increase from what we expect to be this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| And I think that's a reasonable estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| And I like being conservative as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| If you were to say three percent and add another one and a half percent to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| what type of money are we looking at in terms of dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| You know, that would be another one and a half million dollars or so, maybe two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| With regards to the budget itself, you know, as far as property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| you believe that the property taxes will basically be about the same or have you any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| What type of increase have you looked at in terms of property tax collections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| We show a budget-to-budget increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Our current year tax collections are already six million dollars above last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| and they're continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| They've tracked all year better than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| I'm glad to report that at the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| current property tax collections have already exceeded budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| And so I think the trustee's office has done real well in collecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| and we have a small increase from a number that was around $940,000 per penny on the tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| to $975,000 per penny on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| And collections continue strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| At the end of the year when you close out your books June 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| do you expect a surplus in the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| I think what we had planned a drawdown of the general fund for about three million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| and I think that we'll see some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| I think our revenues are going to be about what is expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| and I think spending will be slightly less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| And so I think that actual drawdown is going to be less than three million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| On a couple of specific budget items, the legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| I noticed that we have a $6,000 increase for that budget item from 66 to 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=752)|
| 0:12:41| Why do we need an extra $6,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Because quite frankly I've never really understood why Knox County needs to provide monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| for the legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| I'm not sure what that office does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| When I talk with members of the legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| well, anyway, $6,000 increase just seems to be quite a bit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| Yeah, I think that's primarily due to the change in health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| and I think they provide a valuable service to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| and it's a good way to communicate with the delegation, plan with the delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| and it's a one-person shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Does your office communicate with that office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| I mean, does the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Does anybody on commission communicate with the legislative delegation office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| Well, anyway, with regards to John Tarleton, I know that we have contracted that service out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| and yet we have $719,000 proposed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| What exactly is that money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Primarily a contract with Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| And that's just an increase in our contract with Helen Ross McNabb to operate the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| So they operate it, so they take care of everything in terms of, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| On the Great Schools Foundation, I know that we took $1.2 million out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=842)|
| 0:14:12| and put it into kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| So you'll see a decrease in the great schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| and there's an increase in the operating transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| so we're going to send that money directly to the general purpose school fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| and they're going to incorporate that piece of it into their operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| normal operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| And that was really, I think, just an indicator of the success of the great schools program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| is that they did the test program, the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| It's working well, and they want to incorporate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| and make it a part of their regular budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| What is the salary of the person who is now heading up the Great Schools Foundation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| I don't have the number in front of me, but I understand it's $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| And then, so basically we're looking at about 2.5, 2.4 million for programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| What's the thought process about not putting this under the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| and leaving it under the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| There's a couple of things that are, I think, helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| One, it gives a little bit of freedom to try new things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| and if they don't work out, then they're not obligated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| we're not obligated as a county by maintenance of effort to continue funding that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| And so it's a good format for a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| Let the schools try something new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| and if it's not what they wanted or maybe they wanted to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| then that gives them a little bit of freedom to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| It also gives them a format to try something on a small-scale or a test basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| And so one of the things that I think is also going to be a part of the Great Schools agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| it's been primarily funded with taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| is moving that away from the taxpayer dollars and into privately funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| I know that's one of the charges of the individual is to get private dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| but you're saying that eventually this would not be a line-up in our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| but it would be a private, in other words, private dollars would take care of all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| I think eventually that's the vision of the Great Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| But if we were to take some of that money and, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| put it into the schools to save some of these teaching positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| a half a million dollars or so, what impact would that have on these programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| Well, they would be cut, and that's all there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| When you talk about the new and the innovative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| I think we should get a representative of the Great Schools to be able to talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| but there's no question that they would have to lower what they did, decrease the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| That would be a question I would have perhaps tomorrow afternoon when we have individuals here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| is to talk about the specific programs to see if perhaps there might be some opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| to shift some dollars here just for this year as they're working on these private donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| Mr. Chairman, that's all I have right now, but I do have some questions for schools if we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Did you have a particular person you need to talk to tomorrow evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| I wanted to talk about the Great Schools Foundation also with regards to the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| I'm sure a lot of people have questions about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| So you would need Buzz, Thomas, and okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| Oh, also the legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| I'd like to talk about that legislative delegation money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Yeah, Commissioner Hammond has already asked a lot of the questions that I had wanted to get some information about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| But just going, what do you project the fund balance being for the end of fiscal year 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| when it's all said and done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| That's the one that's ending on June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Our undesignated finished last year at $41 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| We had planned through the budget to use $3 million, so that's $38 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| I think there's going to be some money that department heads do not spend that they're allowed to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| and I can take a number and estimate that that might be a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| Okay, now that's the budget that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| And what is the projected budget at the end of fiscal year 2011, which will be next year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| Right, and that would be another draw of $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| and so we'd start the year about 39 and finish about 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| And I guess what we're going to do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| if we're looking at some of the major things that we were going to discuss today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| obviously the $1.7 million that's requested by the school board was the big item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Maybe we want to leave that discussion for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| I know many of us were at the school board meeting on Friday where we had a lot of these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| Is this something that we want to defer until we hear more from the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| We've sort of had a lot of that discussion already, you know, for several hours on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| Is it something that we would like to discuss today or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Because that's the, you know, if you really look at the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| that's the big item that there's going to be a discussion over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| since there was a formal request from the school board to try to find funds for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| I'm asking a question here for discussion more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| I think if we're going to do it, we probably ought to do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1177)|
| 0:19:47| I agree, I mean, if you're looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| I just don't want to go off on a tangent where someone says let's not do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| The only comment I'd have on the school budget, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| if you look at the functions of our county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| I think everyone will agree that education is probably our number one priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| and then public safety is number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| And I don't think there's one person on this board that does not want to find more money from the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| and particularly in this crisis year where we're looking at laying off school teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| and other personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| The only problem we have is that it's not our problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| and we're not in a vacuum and we're not under a glass case here where we're isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| This is a problem that we're seeing across the country on how to finance our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| As I was driving to the meeting with the school board on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| there was a segment on NPR radio about the number of school teachers that they were laying off in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| And I believe they made the statement that every single school district in California was laying off teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| The same day we met with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| there was an article in the New Sentinel about Blount County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| Blount County has approximately a population of 100,000, which is less than a quarter of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| And also they have an independent Maryville School District and an independent Alcoa School District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| So we're really talking about even a smaller population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| They're laying off 25 teachers, 16 assistant teachers, 15 custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| I won't go through all of them, but it's a total of 70 personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| So the problems that we're having here are the same problems that we're seeing across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| There was a segment on NPR radio again this morning about a school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| that was trying to rehire back some of the teachers they'd laid off in Rhode Island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| So I think the economic downturn, you know, they're describing this as the Great Recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| which is the largest downturn that we've had since the Great Depression in the 1930s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| certainly has affected everyone across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| And, you know, I do want the public to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| and I think that everyone in the commission knows is that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| and will do everything that's possible to try to save these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| and save these jobs and be sure that our children get a good education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| But there are certain economic constraints that we're in right now that makes that job very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1335)|
| 0:22:28| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Let me first thank John Troyer for all he has done recently in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| He was there at the school board thing that Commissioner Briggs mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| He was there when Commissioner Broyles and I met at Time Warped Tea Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| We brought staffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| They did a great job and they answered questions very thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Dwight was there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Thanks to all of you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| And some things have already come out in that regard that we should be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| And I'm glad that Commissioner Briggs has sort of laid the groundwork that we should be talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Yeah, we're looking at 30 teachers being laid off and another 10 teachers' aides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| This is a significant problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| And, yes, you can say that numerically the school budget is up a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| but the up a little bit doesn't even cover the increased costs of their pension obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| They're facing a big hit and we've got to find some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| At those meetings, I've been toying with some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| I like the idea that Commissioner Hammond raised about the legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| We should look seriously there for savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| Let me also suggest that even though our sheriff's department has picked up some additional obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| once we discount those additional obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| it's still up about half a million dollars easily from what I was told at those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| If we were to flat budget the sheriff's department based on that figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| and take the amount that we are getting, giving to the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| the Chamber of Commerce, Innovation Valley, just cut that in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| that would be a total of a little more than a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| Put that together with a legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| things that Commissioner Hammond is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| and we begin to come up with an idea about where we can find that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| And I hope we take seriously those ideas and others that commissioners come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| Now, maybe you don't like everything I've come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Maybe you would like to cut it by a small amount and substitute some other idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| That's fine, but let's find that 1.7 million because the schools cannot afford to take the hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| You know, you can talk about the increasing amount that goes to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| and true, true schools have had increases every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| But when you look at their obligations, the increasing things we ask of them, their pension obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| they're really struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| As a percentage of the budget, as a percentage of what we spend every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| they've actually been down for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| So I hope we do this right and I hope we take seriously those ideas I've suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| and maybe come up with some other ones to reach that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Yes, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| I would like to know up to date what our expenses and revenues are for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| Well, with the general fund, our revenues are about right at 80 percent of collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| At 80 percent collections of our budget, our spending is about 83 percent, and that was just this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| So we're running a little bit in deficit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| How much total fund balance do we have designated and undesignated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| Well, I think one way to describe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| and describe what you're asking is along the lines of what Dr. Briggs talks about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| is I like to use the undesignated just because that is there for the commission to use or not use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| That's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Once it's designated and there's a purpose that's been attached to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| and that's what it's for, the reserves are the ones that are restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| And so for the undesignated piece on the general fund, we finished the year last year, 2009, $41 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| We plan to draw down from that $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| And what we have proposed in the budget is another three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| And like we talked earlier, I think there might be about a million dollars that's turned back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| by the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| In this budget total, designated and undesignated, would you say we're using close to $17 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| Well, let's break down the pieces, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| The school board, they have their own undesignated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| And debt service has its own designated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| How much is Knox County using, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Total undesignated and designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| So, yeah, I think $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| You can say that, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Let's forget about the $8 million we were talking about originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| Another thing, John, on the sales tax revenue, you say we're up about half a million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| This current month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| For March and April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| How much are we down for the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| We're down considerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| We're down about 4 percent, 3.92 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| How much is that, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| That's, you know, at $120 million, that's a good $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| And that's even down less, even more if you go back to the 07-08 when we had a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| And you're basing that on 08-09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Yeah, those are year-to-year comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| We're down quite a bit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Another thing, John, is maybe I misunderstood you about this legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| When I talked to you and the mayor up there the other day, I asked you what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| And you said you didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| And the mayor said he didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| No, that's not what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Well, that's not what you would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Well, that's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| But anyway, so I took it on myself to call Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| Do you know that we're the only one in the state of Tennessee that has a legislative delegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| And I called several representatives and asked what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| Well, they call us every now and then and tell us about what people are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| But also, you know, we're talking about $75,000 next year when you put in a $3,000 car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| You know, that's quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Also, now, we have two lobbyists here that are a total of $80,000 between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1720)|
| 0:28:48| And, John, I've never met one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| I've been here six years, and there's never been one down here that I knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| I don't know whether any of the other commissioners have met them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| What do we pay these people for, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| There are a couple of different contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| And they're to represent the county's interest in Nashville on legislative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| And, you know, this mayor has employed a couple different lobbyists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| and the new mayor is going to have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Well, I thought that's what our representatives were for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| I mean, that's what I thought they were called, representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Another thing, this big hit, we're taking the largest hit in engineering and public works here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| We're taking over $1,600,000 from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| In this budget, we're only saving right at $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| But another thing it looks to me like going through this summary year, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| that we're creating another department in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| This e-purchasing, who is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| What we've done is that we go back to one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| Let's go back to engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| And I share your sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I agree with you on engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| I would like to have a bigger budget for engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| The cost of asphalt is going up, and yet what we're able to provide is going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| And so that hits twice on Bruce's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| And so that's going to decrease what they're able to do in the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| The problem is that you look at the funding that goes into engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| and you get two main items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Well, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| You've got your gas tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| You've got your state funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| And you've got your local sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| And your state funding and local sales tax are not up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| The local sales tax is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| And the money is just not there from its revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| And so we had to bring it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| And I'm disappointed about that, no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| And so you look at, you know, what they're going to be able to do in the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| It's going to be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| What's SC purchasing, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| This seems to be a new department we've created here, $114,000, two new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| And what we're doing is just taking two people from the regular purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| and setting them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| And this is something that our purchasing director wanted to structure his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| And that's continuing to be the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Well, why are we taking them out of purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| For what reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| What are they to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| They're continuing to do just what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| I think our purchasing director felt that it was important that as he manages the workflow in his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| that this was a way that would make sense and help him manage those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| But it's the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| There's no one new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| John, I noticed on these car allowances, we've got $297,676.86 in car allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1907)|
| 0:31:57| And going over this, it looks like a lot of these people are just using these cars to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| and forth to work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| They're not out in the field working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| These allowances run from $9,500 down to $2,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1928)|
| 0:32:17| You know, the government allows you 50 cents a mile, so that $9,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| that means these people are driving close to 19,000 miles a year on county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| but yet they're elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| When are they in the office doing their job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| I think when you talk about a specific elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| that would be something that you should take up with each elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| I think that what we should do, we should make these people start filling out a form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| showing how much they use these cars in their business, in county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| other than going back and forth to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Some of them never leave this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| Another thing we have here, John, this travel budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| It looks like it's $1,311,979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| That's quite a large travel budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| I believe that could be cut some, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| This employee's benefits contribution here, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| it's going from $283,000 to $1,218,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| What's the difference in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Yeah, that's our contribution to the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| I know you serve on the pension board with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| that's our contribution to the defined benefit plan that is required due to the decrease in this stock market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| So that's 100% of that is going to, a million two increase is going to our contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| to fund the defined benefit contribution of the non-sheriff's employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| I couldn't find the mayor's discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| I found the county commission's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Could you tell me how much the mayor's discretionary fund is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| In this proposed budget, the mayor's discretionary fund has been cut from $40,000 to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| $20,000, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| It seems to me like that going through this, too, that we've got a number of new employees we're going to be hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| That's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| It's not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| We've had some reassignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| You know, you take some of the changes that have happened in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| They've taken over responsibility for juvenile security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| They've taken over 4D, some responsibilities in 4D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| They've taken over responsibilities from pretrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| And they've taken over responsibilities of animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| And take, for instance, animal control as a good indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Those employees are employees of the Young-Williams Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| and really not a part of the county's budget, but now they're moving into the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| So now those employees will be a part of the county's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| Nobody knew it's the same people, but just funded through the sheriff's office instead of through the animal center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| I understand that, but not the people at juvenile still work for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| I'll get back to that in just a minute, but it looked to me like we've raised it quite a bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| We can cut a lot of things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| I'm really disappointed with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| I think that they have the same authority that Knox County has over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| I don't know why a fourth of the school teachers could vote to take their step raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| when I think that the school board or the superintendent who's trying to do a good job over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| in my opinion, could have said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| I would like to find that money to fund these teachers, but there's not 30 teachers who are going to lose their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| I talked to the superintendent personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Some of these people are going to be reassigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Some of them are going to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| But I would not want to give it to them in their budget because I look for this to be even worse next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| regardless of this two-month sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Now, I was laughed at in the 08-09 budget when I said we were close to going into something like the Great Depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| but it's here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I voted against the budget last year because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| But we need to give this money through the Great Schools Foundation if we're going to keep these teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| and tell them to really work on their budget next year, try to find something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| If they cut that budget one-half percent, that would roughly be a million and a half or two million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2199)|
| 0:36:48| But we can come up with some money here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| These discretionary funds right now, in this day and time, I feel like should be cut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| I feel like we need to cut our travel at least one or two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| The food budget, I think, can be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| I realize we can't cut the sheriffs because the prisoners are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| But no department up here should have a food budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| If we want to, we can eat before we come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| There's a lot of little things that will add up into that we could come up with this million and a half or million five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| But I believe a million dollars would save 20 school teachers jobs over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| But like I say, I don't want to give it to them in their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| They need to work on their budget next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Now, by state law, we have to fund 95 percent of their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| For someone to say that we need to lay people off over here to fund a school budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| that's ridiculous for them to keep their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| I realize it's more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| But you have to realize we're working on trying to cut our budget, and we gave them an extra three and a half million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| And so we're not cutting their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| We're giving them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| I don't think the inflation rate's been that high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| but I think the teachers really need to take a good look at some of the teachers they're working for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| especially the ones that are in KCEA, that they would rather me lose their job and them get their raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| They need to really think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Now, I'm not trying to cause problems over there, but I still think we can come up with the money here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| And I'll be giving you a few more items here tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| But, you know, it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| We can't raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Now, they're telling us that the unemployment here in Knox County is 8.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| I would have to disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| And the reason why I would have to disagree with that, if you take the city government, the Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| the University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge, TVA, those people are still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| They're classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| But the people that are paying their bills out here, they're the ones that's out of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| If you just figured it on them, you're going to be talking about 12, probably 15% on the unemployment rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| But that's all I have to say today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Commissioners, you had a document placed at your desk there just a little while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| and that's a response to a request that I made last week, last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| to the school system for salary information from the central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| One of the things that's sort of hung around for a long time, for a number of years, at least ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| has been the idea that possibly central office is a place where we ought to look for saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:42| And all I'm trying to do with this is I'm not trying to start World War II again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| III again with the school system, but I think that that notion should be dispelled if it is false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2388)|
| 0:40:00| So that's the purpose for the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| And given the form that this is in, I assume it was sent in PDF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| so we'll try to get some people to take a look at it and segregate it in a way that's a little more meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2411)|
| 0:40:22| The structure that I'd hoped to get would have been similar to the organizational chart structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2422)|
| 0:40:31| that's in the administrative page that's on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| But anyway, I'll work with that some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| I appreciate anybody else that would like to work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Everyone's interested in no one wants a teacher to lose their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| We all know how important those classroom teachers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| And it's certainly my intent to make sure that every means within the school system is addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2453)|
| 0:41:02| to make sure that does not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| And the administrative capacity of the schools, that's their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| There's going to be some programs that may be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| There's going to be some people that are retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| You know, the effective loss of jobs, there's going to be some of those which can be absorbed by the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2477)|
| 0:41:27| And maybe those are translated into layoffs or removal of position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| I don't know how they're trying to describe it or explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| But the bottom line is we don't want teachers, if any teacher loses or a position is cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| it means every other teacher absorbs the weight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| So it means that every student has less exposure to their teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| It means that every teacher is reduced in their ability to do their job, to transmit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| to deliver their responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| And so I get a little bit sore when the school system's immediate reaction to budget concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| is the first thing is that they throw out, well, we're going to have to lay off teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| I think that's disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| And certainly the way they address their $1.7 million shortfall, I think, is disingenuous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2543)|
| 0:42:30| just to throw it right back to us and say, okay, you all figure that out from the county's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| We've done the best we can on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| So, anyway, that's all that I have and I hope to have some more information for you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Mr. Thomas, can you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| I've got a few questions that I've had a few phone calls over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| While he's coming down, I share with Mr. Norman the concern that school board has taken teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2578)|
| 0:43:10| out of the classroom first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| And that was their first gift to us, I guess you'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| I'm reading over this list, and if I counted them right, there's 19 pages, has 19 people on each page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| Roughly on this list, I can't, 370 people maybe, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2604)|
| 0:43:36| One in eight of them make over $90,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| So central office is thick, and I share that opinion with you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| Mr. Thomas, I had a call from a parent in regards to Carnes Middle and the orchestra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| And they also informed me that the county is doing away with the talented and gifted program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| It's not eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| It's being rebranded, restructured, actually, so that federal dollars can be used to fund about an equal number of positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2642)|
| 0:44:10| I think it was maybe 17 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| In the past, it's been a pull-out program where the teachers have actually maybe worked with very few students in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| And by doing it this way, we're looking at possibly providing more services to children who are eligible for talented and gifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| So it's not being done away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| It's just going to be restructured and funded in a different way because the federal dollars can come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| and pay for that, which allows us to make reductions to the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| So the students are not going to get any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| And I think the kids that are in TAG, we'll call it for shortness, the kids that are in TAG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| I think they get bored at general instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| That's fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| And so when we pulled them out with TAG, we gave them some individualized attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| We gave them some structure for growth and prepared them and kept them interested in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| And I think that the issue was that there were just so few students being touched in that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| when there are more students who are talented and gifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| And this was something I know that was worked with the principals, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| in looking at how we deliver these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| And it could be done in a more efficient way and actually touch more students by doing it in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| We're not going to pull them out of this classroom, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| It's going to be my concern is that we're going to touch more kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| but it's going to take away from individualized time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| These kids are going to go back to being bored is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| And so I'm getting calls predominantly about the orchestra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| Why did we eliminate a program that's working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Well, in terms of the allocations, allocations being that we fund all the schools based on looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| demographics at a particular school in terms of the numbers of free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| and reduced children that are served, we developed a staffing formula that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| essentially says that the schools with the same demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| and an equal number of students are going to be funded in a similar fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| And in terms of making those reductions, looking at the formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| there were schools that were slated to lose positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| And working with the principal of that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| asking for their recommendation in terms of a position that you're going to lose a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| So now you look at your program and you determine which position you could, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| most afford to lose even though the program certainly is a very important program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| And I know there are a number of kids served by that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| So it was just basically the staffing formula and the allocations for the school that said a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| you need to give up a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| And then with the principal's input, that was said to Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| And that's how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Because from what I understand, this guy has came in and changed the lives of many kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| And this group has probably been in existence for two to three years, maybe a little bit longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| has started winning competitions regionally and nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| And now we're going to cut it because of a formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| He's even going over to the high school and teaching kids that he had previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| I'm real concerned about the school board choosing to cut the classroom before they cut out their administrative fat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| And I'd love to give $1.7 million to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| But I don't think the reduction, I don't think the hard choices have been made yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| The hard choices was to either send it to commission or do it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| And I don't think they made the hard choices with central staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| And I know it's not you, but you're the only representative I saw here, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| But I found it odd that one in eight or nine people in central office make $90,000 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| I find that odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Not that I don't think that administrators and teachers should be paid a due amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| That's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| That's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| That's a high number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| One in ten people that walk in the Andrew Johnson building make $90,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| And we didn't make hardly any cuts over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| I think if you're on the administrative side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| I would encourage you guys to relook at cutting classrooms versus cutting administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| Because I think we made a terrible mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| And I know that you're only one to make a suggestion, not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| Has the superintendent's office grown since Dr. McIntyre got here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| We've got a chief accountability office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| We've got two assistant superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| What else do we have in that superintendent's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| And, of course, the chief accountability officer position is vacant at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| But it is a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| It's in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| It's in the budget, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| The other positions, chief of staff position, Dr. McIntyre did reorganize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| and took it to the board last summer, organized staff in a fashion where I think he felt like he could best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| carry forward the goals of the Board of Education and the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| So there were some positions created, but some positions eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| Of course, the deputy superintendent's position was eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| and the salary of the chief of staff would be able to create that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| and still not spend quite as much money as had been spent on the deputy superintendent position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| So there were some reductions such as that that allowed Dr. McIntyre to reorganize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| and I think pretty much do so without spending a whole lot of additional monies in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| Even with the accountability officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| What's the budget line item for the accountability officer and what do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| I thought the superintendent's being paid to be accountable and that's kind of what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| I want to make sure we're paying him $250,000 a year to run a school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| To have to have somebody for accountability kind of strikes me as odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| If you'll explain the position, I might understand it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Well, and of course I know Dr. McIntyre plans to be here I think tomorrow afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| I'm not trying to avoid the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| But in terms of what the accountability officer, looking at the strategic plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| looking at the measurements that need to be in place to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| and ensure that we're making the progress that we need to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| looking at the achievement from that standpoint, I guess pretty much just driving that, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3032)|
| 0:50:41| that train, I guess, to look at our strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| and make sure with all four goals that we have measurements in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| that we're making progress on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| And there's a real focus on looking at the academic achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| and the data around each individual student in terms of being able to prescribe more directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| the type of instruction that an individual student needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| I mean, a lot of the way we've functioned in the past is you get a test back and the year's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| It's more akin to being able to do an autopsy, I guess, if you will, to find out what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| But this way, what we're looking at with the data warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| and the accountability is actually being able to provide data and information to principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| and teachers to allow them to provide the specific instruction that each child needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| That's a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Also, the function was to oversee the federal programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| Title I, a huge amount of federal dollars involved in Title I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| And to look specifically at Title I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Also, another function was to help us to evaluate the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| I think a way that you redirect funds is you look at what's working and what's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| And part of the chief accountability's job was to look at all the instructional programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| and provide meaningful, again, meaningful data to help us to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| as to whether a program is functioning in the manner that it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| or is it something where that program should be deleted, I guess, and those funds directed elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| And I'll just one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| I looked on the flow chart, the organizational chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| What is a coach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| Instructional coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| I mean, we had 110 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| The instructional coach is part of the excellence through literacy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| that the board approved a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| and we've continued to try to direct funds in that, again, to help students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| But the instructional coaches, their job primarily is to go into the classroom to help teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| in terms of providing from an instructional standpoint, I guess, practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| and methodology and things of that nature, working directly with those teachers, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| who work with the kids to try to, as much as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| help them to be more effective and more efficient in what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| which is, of course, delivering services to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| So they're in the areas of reading and math primarily, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| And I think that does well to address the 10 percent that generally create the problem for the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| as far as being able to teach the overall curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| How many teachers do we have in the county currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Here's probably, and depending on which way you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| I say that by saying, do you count a librarian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| A certified classroom teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| It's probably about, it's in the neighborhood of 3,800, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| 3,800 to 3,900 possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| I don't know if Commissioner Anders, the superintendent is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| I didn't know if he was going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| I just had some questions and concerns and we'll discuss, I guess, those tomorrow when we talk about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| Well, let me maybe address one thing that you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| And let me say up front that I do agree with you and Commissioner Norman in that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3246)|
| 0:54:14| I think the, you know, that round up the usual suspect phrase will probably be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| in us going with the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| I think the teachers should probably be the last thing that we take a look at cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| So with that said, I also feel that, and I think I complimented the superintendent on last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3268)|
| 0:54:38| in that he brought us a budget that was, you know, solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| I think years prior, previous school administration, there was a lot of fluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| and we had to, you know, go in and say, okay, now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| you're not really going to have the same amount of teachers that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| as a Farragut as you did as a Hardin Valley, so why are you budgeting like both schools going to be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| at full levels or staffed at full levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| So I commend him in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Now, this gets a little more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Now, we've, you know, we have given you a balanced budget with an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| I thought you said you could handle it, and I think you can handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| But now we're asking for 1.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| So we're kind of in a different world now when the teachers did what the teachers did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| the union did what the union did, and now we had a meeting on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| and that was a listening opportunity for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| But let me say up front that we're, this 1.7 now, we're, you know, like I said at the meeting on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| when we start getting in other folks' lanes, you're kind of giving us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| abilities to ask more difficult questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| Please be prepared for that with the school board's request for an additional $1.7 million in this environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3346)|
| 0:55:56| With where we are today, had the opportunity to go to a county officials' conference that was in D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| and when we went to Atlanta, I picked up an Atlanta newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| and DeKalb County was going to lay off triple-digit teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| They were looking at taking their student-teacher ratios up to the max for every level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| Fulton County was in even worse shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| Having to make some really, really difficult, tough decisions, doing away with programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| athletic and academic programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Made it up to D.C., and we could all, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| imagine what the D.C. public schools are in terms of their financial shape and strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| With that said, I don't think we're in nowhere near that bad of a shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| In fact, on a Monday, there was a USA Today article on how Knox was one of the bright spots in the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| That was so you can date it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| I think you all probably remember that article, that our housing market was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| not great but getting better and a lot better than most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| So here we are, having to have this difficult conversation about teaching and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3423)|
| 0:57:11| I think Mr. Andrews brought up and Mr. Thomas answered the question about the accountability office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3431)|
| 0:57:20| To me, that's something, and I don't know, your timing may be off a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| but that to me is a new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| That's something that's looking at efficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| trying to make our classrooms better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Why isn't that in Race to the Top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Why didn't we think about putting that in Race to the Top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| I don't know if we're upside down now because we staffed it for a month or two or it's in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| but that's a new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Why are we looking for ongoing dollars to pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| Because with this new program, once we get our efficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| is this a 20-year employee that we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| Or is it someone that's going to come in and look at our school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| look at our academic programs, see where we're failing, make recommendations, and move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| Are we hiring another staff, like Commissioner Pinkson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| that we're going to have to fund, you know, from now until eternity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| because we have to keep this funding level where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| I would say I wouldn't have a heart looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and we just got the opportunity to look at these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| And they're difficult to dissect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| And I'm sure everyone's churning through and dissecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| I think 1.7 is a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I think there's a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| There's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Let me take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| There's not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| There's fat in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| There's fat in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| There's fat across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| I know we're getting down, both in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| You know, the sheriff's been having to make some really difficult decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| Even though we're giving him bumps, he's having to make some difficult decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| To be quite honest, I voted against his budget the first year, but, I mean, he has done a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| a really good job of saying, hey, this is the minimum that it's going to take me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| I don't see that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| With you all asking for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| You know, with you asking for more than the original increase that the mayor proposed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| So there was also some statements made about getting the UOL's portion of the Rainy Day Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3557)|
| 0:59:24| down to the minimum of three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| As I looked at the numbers, and I may be wrong, and, John, you may want to correct me on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| the amount that you're pulling out of your portion of the Rainy Day Fund doesn't get you down to three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| I'm not saying that we should go down to the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| but I think statements were made in that we pulled all that we can out of the Rainy Day Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| to get us down to the minimum that the school board should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| The way the numbers look to me, it looked like there was some additional funds available for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| John, could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Yeah, our numbers, and I think it just comes back to there's uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| I mean, that's all it is, is when you start to predict what our year-end numbers are going to be for revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| our year-end numbers are going to be for expenditures, and not only for June 30, 2010, June 30, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| and the schools are more cautious than I am, but I think we both agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| and I think that's our point, is that this is as much as we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| Well, again, you know, when you say we're taking it down to the bare minimum, man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| the bare minimum didn't look like it was reached, looking at the numbers that were presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3629)|
| 1:00:37| So, you know, I just say again, and I warn folks, don't let the county commission in your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3637)|
| 1:00:46| And I tell folks that, the offices, if we get in, we're going to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| So you all have asked us for additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| We're not going to write a blank check on this one, at least me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| and I think that's kind of the feeling of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| I think we're going to have to have a serious conversation between now and the time that the budget is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| John, you explained the sheriff taking on animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| That just took on this year, so that explains his increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| But you're taking one more employee on this year in the finance department, and the mayor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| What is the total salary of these two people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Yeah, with the, let's talk about the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| And in the mayor's office, his secretary went to work for the school department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| That position is still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| What we did is we changed a part-time person to a full-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| And that mayor's administrative assistant is an open position, but we think it should be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| and let the new incoming mayor make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3717)|
| 1:02:15| Okay, on the finance department, what we've done is we've cut our part-time position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| and made that a full-time position in order to take on additional responsibility on our position control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| and our new software that we're implementing as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| We're going live July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| How much more does that create in expense, those two positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| Well, if you take the finance department, our increase was like $18,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| and our increase for health insurance was $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| And so more than our total increase was health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Let me tell you some things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| If we cut this travel allowance 1%, that's approximately four teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3780)|
| 1:03:09| If we cut the lobbyists out, that's two teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| If we cut the legislative delegation out, that's almost two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| If we make these people start filling out car reports on their travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| that would probably be another two teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| So you're talking about just in those four things right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| you're talking about roughly ten teachers' jobs saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| But like I say, I don't want this to go straight to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| I want it to go through the greater school partnership or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| because I don't believe we're going to be able to fund it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| I really look for things to be worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| and then let them try to work on their budget and see what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| I really appreciate what Dr. McIntyre did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| I think he presented a good budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| I blame the KCEA, the vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| and one-fourth of the teachers have decided over there that they wanted to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| and let their buddies be laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| And I just think that's terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| When out in the private sector people are taking cuts on hours even to keep their brothers working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3849)|
| 1:04:18| Ms. Nabarro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| And, John, I wanted to say thank you also for you and your staff coming out Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| and meeting in the second district to answer questions about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| It was a good discussion and very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| I've had some good conversations with India Kincannon about the school budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| India is actually my representative on the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| and I'm actually her representative on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| So we have a lot to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| I feel like the school board and Dr. McIntyre have worked hard to put this budget together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| I also appreciated last year your very straightforward approach to the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3897)|
| 1:05:08| One thing that I don't want to see is I don't want to see this budget process becoming adversarial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| between the school board and the commission because I think that we've made a lot of progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| in the last few years on our working relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| and I don't want to see that damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| I also think that we keep talking about cutting fat and trimming fat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| and we've been doing that, the commission's been doing that for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| and we're still having problems and I think we need to acknowledge there's still some more things that we can trim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| but there's just not a whole lot left to trim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| And I hope that we will remember this in the future when we start talking more about sales taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3939)|
| 1:05:48| how regressive, I hope this helps drive home how regressive sales taxes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| and when you depend on them for a large portion of your revenue, how volatile it can become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| and the problems it can cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| I think that everybody has talked about some really good places that we can cut, travel funds, discretionary funding, food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3962)|
| 1:06:11| lobbyists, legislative delegations, the chamber and those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| It's definite that we can do some cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| It's going to hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| I think the school can revisit theirs one more time and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| I mean, I think that we're willing to make some more sacrifices as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| if the school board is willing to make some more sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| One of the things that I do want to point out, though, is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| and this is my reply for people who don't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| who are concerned about the amount of money that we spend in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| or the fact that they don't have any children or their children are already through the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| so they don't think their tax dollars need to go to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| The kids we're educating today are the ones who are going to be sitting up here in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| and they're going to be making decisions on our behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| when we aren't the ones making the decisions anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| And I want those people to be as well educated as they can possibly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| because they're going to be deciding where my tax dollars are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| They're going to be making the decisions that affect my day-to-day life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| So I don't think that we can lessen the importance of the job these teachers are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4041)|
| 1:07:32| when we look at what we're talking about long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| Also, I think that teachers and administrators should be the highest paid people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| Their jobs are certainly the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| and I think that they deserve their step increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| I think that I just don't want to see us cutting too much out of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4068)|
| 1:07:58| and I don't want us to lose a single classroom teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| I also think, and this may seem like a really radical suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| but I think while we're looking at out-of-the-box solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| maybe we as a commission should consider the possibility of only approving a six-month budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| only through the end of the year so that the new administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| when it comes in, can rework the budget instead of waiting until next year to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4102)|
| 1:08:32| And I'm not saying that I approve of this or that I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| I'm just saying that while we're thinking out-of-the-box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| let's think about everything and see if maybe that can spark some other ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| So again, this is a very painful process for every department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| and, again, thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for what you and the school board have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4131)|
| 1:09:00| And I hope that we can move forward on this without having to lose any more classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| Could I ask Ms. Burrells a question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| First of all, I want to tell you an answer to something, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| When people say they don't have kids in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| come back and tell them somebody paid for them going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Another thing, would you be willing to give your discretionary fund up to keep a teacher's job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| All right, if we gave up our discretionary fund and the mayor gave up his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| that would be another one-and-a-half teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| So we're up to about 11-and-a-half teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Cutting something out that these things that we're talking about cutting don't even mean anything in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| Well, I will say that all the small neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| and community organizations depend on those discretionary dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| But, you know, guys, we're talking about priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| And what I hear from every single commissioner when we sit up here is that the education of our children is our number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| So is it or is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| I think there's a single person sitting up here that doesn't feel like, as I said Friday at the budget meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| school budget meeting, that education is the only answer for us ahead out of some of the problems that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4218)|
| 1:10:29| My concern is that we're not all dancing to the same music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4229)|
| 1:10:40| When I look at these two sheets of figures that Commissioner Norman gave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| and I realize, let me preface it by saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| that I realize that most of the higher paid positions with the school system are in supervisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| because they've worked their way up to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| But when I look at the differences here in salaries this year versus last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| I don't know how long it would take to run those numbers up, but because of the step raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| when you look at a whole sheet, 4,000 here, 1,000 there, 2,000 here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4274)|
| 1:11:23| I'm sure that there are several classroom teachers represented in those dollar amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| But the thing that we need to remember, too, is that we're not losing teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4290)|
| 1:11:38| If it went through as we're talking about right now, we're not losing teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| We're losing positions because there will be probably 200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| 250 teachers hired before the school starts next year because of attrition, retirements, people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4306)|
| 1:11:56| John's wife graduated from UT and they're going to take a job in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| So that leaves a position open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| It's not that we're losing teachers, we're losing positions in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| I think that if we're asking us to cut, every other department to cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| I say we're not all willing to put our two cents worth in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| And I think when you take some of these step raises and some of these high salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| they amount to a lot of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| And I'm also a firm believer that teachers have been grossly underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| But a lot of people in the private sector have been, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| And the fact that they're not getting a raise this year, they're happy to have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| The city employees got a two and a half percent because that's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| They have to give them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| But other than that, there's nobody else unless they're changing positions is getting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| So I just don't think we're all playing on the same level field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| I have several questions since Dr. McIntyre is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| And I appreciate your coming over, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| I want to give you an opportunity to, first of all, respond to anything that you may have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| And then I have a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| I guess the one thing I'd like to respond to from the previous line of questioning is the notion that the first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| that we're doing is cutting teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| This is, I believe, the fifth time that I've come before the county commission to talk about the fiscal year 2011 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| We started talking about it back in December and tried to keep you informed along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| As you recall, we started with about a $19 million shortfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| between our expected expenditures and our likely revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| We have worked over the last several months to close that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| And we have done so, I think, diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| and with an eye toward minimizing any negative impact on the education of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| We have proposed numerous cost reduction measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| We have proposed numerous expenditure reduction measures, including things like utilities, non-personnel costs like technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| materials, supplies, travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| We are taking a one-day furlough of all central office employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| We've reduced parking subsidies for central office administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| We have eliminated parking subsidies for central office administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| We are increasing the fees on outside use of school facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| We have, I think, taken a very hard look at all of our expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| And, in fact, when you look at the information that was shared on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| with some of the commissioners who came to a meeting with the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| you'll see that the proportional reduction of expenditures in our central office is somewhere between 4 and 9 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4488)|
| 1:14:56| whereas we've tried to keep the reductions in instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| and instructional support areas to a minimal about 1.5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| So, again, I guess the thing that I want to just respond to most is this notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| that we are cutting teacher positions first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| It is, in fact, as you recall, we came to the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| with a proposal that would have reduced us down to about nine teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| That would have assumed that all of our employees not take a salary increase next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| And, unfortunately, we have a negotiation process that requires ratification by the membership of our bargaining unit, KCEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4527)|
| 1:15:35| and that tentative agreement on compensation was not ratified, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| So we find ourselves in a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| These are difficult times, and this is a difficult economic situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| and we are trying our level best to present a budget that is both fiscally responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| and educationally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| The Board has adopted a balanced budget for the commission's consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| but the Board has, indeed, requested that if there are additional revenues to be found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| that those additional revenues be provided so that we might be able to restore some of the teacher positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| that we have, unfortunately, had to reduce in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| We have provided salary information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| We have, as I said, taken reductions in the central office of something in the neighborhood of four to nine percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4578)|
| 1:16:27| and, again, tried to keep the reductions in our instructional areas as minimal as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4587)|
| 1:16:34| I did want to address also the question that Commissioner Anders asked and Mr. Thomas answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| and a couple of other folks raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| The chief accountability officer position is a position that has a new name and has some new responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| but it's been a position we've had in place for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| A gentleman by the name of Mike Winstead, who many of you know, was in that position for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| and it's a critical position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| It's a position that oversees our federal programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| It's a position that oversees our research and evaluation unit that helps us know if we're doing our work effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| and it's a position that helps us make sure that we are monitoring accountability under the No Child Left Behind Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| and making sure that we are using data effectively in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| That is a critical component to our success for the future, and we had for a short time a gentleman by the name of James Ashby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| filling that position, who was doing a marvelous job in helping our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| and our teachers use data effectively to do their job more effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| and help our kids learn even more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| So I will leave it at that, and I'm sure Mr. Hammond, I appreciate your, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| I appreciate the opportunity to address what's gone before, but I know you have several questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| Yes, Commissioner Pinkston had mentioned that he had had a conversation with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| and you had said that there would not be 30 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| I'm wondering what the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| What do you see as the realistic number if, indeed, you don't see it as 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| So there's a net reduction of 30 teacher positions in the adopted budget by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| So that may not mean there are 30 layoffs of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| In fact, it means that there are more than 30 reductions in some places and additions in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| It's a net reduction of 30 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| And, in fact, I believe we have transmitted or if we have not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| we'll transmit today to the commission a list position by position of the reductions that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| and the disposition of the employees who might have been in those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| Some are retirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Some are transferred or will be transferred to other positions that are open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| and are in their certification area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| Some will be through attrition and retirement and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| but there will be some where if it's a position that's being reduced in a certification area that we don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4726)|
| 1:18:54| whole lot of those positions or maybe we only have one position where that might be an actual layoff for a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| So you should get a better sense of that through the document that I think if it hasn't been transmitted to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| it's on its way this morning so that you have a sense of it's been shared with the Board of Education a week or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| I believe we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| Thank you for sharing those documents today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| With regards to the race to the top money, how much of that are we getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| I know you told us that before, but have you gotten a better sense of how that money is going to be able to be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| In fact, it's about $13.2 million over a four-year period, a little over $3 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| and a scope of work was approved by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| It will be on your consent agenda at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| Those dollars are not allowed to be used for ongoing ordinary operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| So we could not take those dollars and fund teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| However, those funds have already provided some relief to our general fund budget in this budget development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| There are some things that we're going to be able to do through race to the top that either would have had to have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| funded through the general fund or simply we wouldn't have been able to do had we not received race to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| So, for example, our Leadership Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| which is to really grow the next generation of great school principals in our school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| It's a partnership with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| It leverages about another two-plus million dollars in donations and grants from foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4822)|
| 1:20:30| That is about a $700,000 commitment in race to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| Those would have been funds that we otherwise would have struggled to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| We might have tried to find some of them through the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| but it's provided some relief already in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| Strategic compensation, so an additional probably more than $1.5 million a year for the next several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| will go toward paying our teachers additional compensation for the types of inputs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| and outcomes that we want to see from our classroom teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| So that's going to be, I think it's an important thing for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| It is reflective of the law that passed recently in the state of Tennessee allowing for that kind of compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| It's reflective of the law that passed with a requirement of an annual evaluation of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| 50 percent of which has to be based on student outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| And it's something that we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| It's in our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| It's something that we've identified a long time ago that we want to really provide additional compensation to our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| for those types of behaviors and outcomes that we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| That's in the scope of work for Race to the Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Formative assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Formative assessment is we want to have a landscape of formative assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| so that teachers have closer to real-time data on how their students are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| The summative assessments, the TCAPs that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| and the gateways that we do at the end of the year give us good information about how students have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| but it's really in the past tense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| It's really how did they do this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Formative assessments allow our teachers to see how our students are doing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| and be able to adjust their instruction and see how their students are learning different concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| And that's also part of the scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| And that's something we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| It's something we need desperately and probably would have had to find a way to fund it out of the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| if it had not been for the Race to the Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| So while Race to the Top can't, you know, plug our budget hole, it can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| it can't bring back the teacher positions that we've had to cut in this difficult budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| It has provided some relief already in terms of the work that we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| and our ability to do it within limited resources in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| In looking at the Great Schools Foundation budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| part of that, as I understand it, is to give teachers incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| You're saying that the Race to the Top money can also be used for teachers incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Is it possible to use that federal money over the next four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| perhaps reduce the Great School Foundation contribution toward that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| and perhaps use that money to secure some of these positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| Yeah, it's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| I think the idea with the Great Schools Partnership is exactly that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| to reduce its reliance on public funding over the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| In fact, Buzz Thomas, who's the new president of the Great Schools Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| is working very hard to raise private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| One of the things that is in our scope of work also is the expansion of TAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| TAP is the Teacher Advancement Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| It's a great school reform model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| It is at four of our schools right now, and we're seeing great things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| Holston Middle School is a great example of where TAP can be very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| It has a couple components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| It has a teacher collaboration component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| which means teachers are working together around specific parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| and ways to improve their instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| It has a teacher leadership component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| It has mentor and master teachers working with the teachers to improve their instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| It has a great accountability piece to it, component to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| in that it has a terrific evaluation rubric that's very detailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| very specific about what good teaching looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| and where you are on that continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| And then it also has incentive compensation in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| So if you do well in terms of student outcomes with your kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| and the school does well, you get additional compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| And it's based on, again, that evaluation rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| That's something we want to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| It's something that we hope to expand substantially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| and there's a variety of potential funding sources for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| One is Race to the Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Another is the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| And, in fact, we've also partnered with the NIET,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| which is the National Institute for Excellence in Teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| which is the national organization that oversees TAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| And they've been very interested in working with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| seeing the success that we've had here, and expanding TAP to more of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| So NIET just wrote for us, essentially, an I3 grant, a federal grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| It's called Invest in Innovation, an I3 grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| And they're going to work with us to write a TIF grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| a Teacher Incentive Fund grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| So we're looking at a variety of different funding sources to try to invest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| and expand upon the success that we've had with an excellent school reform model in TAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| How many cars or do you have any vehicles that you are looking at purchasing next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| Mr. Thomas, do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| Commissioner, I don't have that information with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| Typically, what we do is replace some of the vehicles in maintenance at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| Of course, when they become in a state of disrepair, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| in terms of spending more on operating them than it would cost to replace them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| I think we had about $200,000 in capital in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| I need to look specifically, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| So that's what we -- I think last year we had about $200,000 for replacement of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Could you look at that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| Because my thought process is if you could just make it one more year, that's $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| You know, that might be able to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| But anyway, if you could get me that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Let me double check and be sure we didn't already reduce it, but I will check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Also, while you're there, Bob, the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| It was told to us earlier that at any given time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| you might have a million dollars' worth of inventory in the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| We just approved the Staples contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| I'm just wondering, why do we need a warehouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| And if the million-dollar figure is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| why do we need a million dollars in inventory at any given time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| Let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| And that's not to say that we could get out of the warehouse business because we have looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| I think most recently we looked at it last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| and we were thinking probably in the neighborhood of a couple of hundred thousand dollars that it would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| if we eliminated the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| And they say, why does it cost more to eliminate the warehouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Of course, Mr. Underwood is here today, too, in case he gets into specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| But in terms of maintenance, I talked with Mr. French,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| and we try to keep anywhere from 45 to 60 days' worth of inventory in Stockton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| And toilet paper, paper towels, now a million dollars, you say, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| That's a lot of toilet paper, a lot of paper towels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| But in addition to that, there are cleaning chemicals such as the wax and things that we keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| And Mr. French has recommended we keep about 45 to 60 days of inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| We buy a lot of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| I know Mr. Underwood told me just this morning we save, it would cost us about $3 more on a case for paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| if we bought it from, not trying to direct a shot at any vendor, but I think Office Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| we would spend $3 more a case just in the paper cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| So we buy things by the tractor-trailer load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| And I think we've got five to six individuals that work in the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| And, of course, we drive delivery trucks that take things out to the schools on a couple of times a week basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5257)|
| 1:27:44| So they're possibly, I know Dr. McIntyre has asked us to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| There's a possibility that we could get out of the warehouse business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| but I think we'd need to put, to do an analysis on that to be sure that it's not going to cost us more to not operate the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5272)|
| 1:28:02| I would echo that if you would look at that as far as, you know, having all of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| plus your inventory controls and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| If you just kind of let us know how you're doing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| The other question I have has to do with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Commissioner Smith, you're on the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| He had mentioned parking, and I know that that's something that we had done was we did a study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| and I was talking to Mr. Walls about that, about the number of people that park for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| But is this committee addressing that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Let me just bring the commissioner up, and, Chris, he sat on the committee with us also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| For over 20 years, the school people, people here at this place, City County, they pay $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5309)|
| 1:28:38| At the Dwight Castle, they pay $30, but the school system pays $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| The school board makes up the difference, the other $20, and they've done it for some 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| We've made a recommendation that they stop that and they pay the full salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| And, Brad, it sort of goes back to what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| We feel that they're the ones that can afford it the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Dr. McIntyre, you're aware of that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| But, Paul, what that does, it gives us another school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| It saved us about $28,000 is what we came up with just on that one item alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| So, hopefully, that will get you another school teacher right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| Yes, we've, you know, we've heard rumblings about what the, and, of course, Mr. Stukesbury is on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| so we've heard a little bit about where the committee might go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| I'm not aware of any formal recommendations yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| The PBA is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| They're going to come and make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| I thought they were going to come the month of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| I guess they're going to do that in the month of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| But bottom line is they're wanting the people to, Andrew Johnson, let them pay the full $30,000 like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| Yes, and our proposal does have, does eliminate the parking subsidy for all central office administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5373)|
| 1:29:40| There is still some, a little bit left in our budget, maybe it's $15,000 or something like that, for our secretarial folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| Because these are folks who, if they're out of school, they don't have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| If they're here and they're making, you know, $18,000 or $20,000 or $21,000 a year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| we thought it was appropriate to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| But obviously, we'll wait on the recommendations of the committee and work from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| And that's what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| You know, in the sheriff's office, you look at the other, all these secretaries in here, they're paying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| They're having to pay the full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| In fact, as I understand, theirs is going to go up if they choose to park here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| So, you know, you're asking the taxpayers to pay for the secretaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| You know, we think if you've got a job that we'd like for them to pay the full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| But we'll talk about that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Are you finished, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Dr. McIntyre, I want to make sure I'm correcting what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| Did you say that you had a balanced budget before the KCA vote and with no layoffs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| No, with a reduction of nine teacher positions, net nine teacher positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| That's the first one, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| Yeah, so, you know, and again, that was contingent upon, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| ratification of the tentative compensation agreement, which was not ratified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| So, you know, we recognize that's the process that we have and that's what we have to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| And so we've had to make an additional 21 teacher position cuts based on going back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5460)|
| 1:31:10| But we've also made, as I mentioned, a lot of other reductions in a lot of other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| including furloughs for central office employees for one day and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| Commissioner Naumann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| And, again, I appreciate the information that your office has supplied thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5487)|
| 1:31:34| I appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| I think the community and those of us that are familiar with education, we see innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| We see your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| Now, to the subject, a couple of things about the information supplied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| First of all, I did ask for gross salaries for the staff, for the central office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5513)|
| 1:32:03| And by that, what I really wanted or what I hoped to get in the correspondence was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5523)|
| 1:32:13| organizational chart that you supply on your website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| If I can just have the gross salaries of those people right there for that year, that will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| There's a couple of other factors that I'm curious about in terms of calculation, compensation, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| I do appreciate the categories that you've given us, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| So, Commissioner, they are within the document that we've given you in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| And rather than trying to, you know, make it pretty, we gave you all the salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| So those are gross salaries for 08-09?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| My understanding is that that's what's in there, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5570)|
| 1:32:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Well, I'll double-check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Now, you did just a couple of other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| There's been some mention several times about the fact that the compensation or KCA turned down your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5580)|
| 1:33:10| request for step to forego step increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| And that's a very interesting event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| I mean, for Knox County, for people that are unfamiliar with teachers and teachers union and teacher union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5600)|
| 1:33:29| activities, there's some, there's possibly a lot of things within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| And so that's a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| I don't know what, I don't know really what the statistic is about the members of KCA or the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5619)|
| 1:33:46| teachers who are actually members of KCA, but it's a percentage that's considerably less than 50% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| teachers in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| And if that's so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Commissioner, we have access to that information, I think, once every two years for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| So I don't, quite honestly, I don't know right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| Nevertheless, just to, so there's, and this is somewhat of an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| It's always been assumed that KCA was very much an advocate of the administration during my time as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5651)|
| 1:34:23| teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| And so for me to see something like this, this type of activity, this was a bit shocking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| I'm sure it was somewhat shocking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| So there's some other things that are within this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| Certainly there's, there may be some measure of discontent, and this is just for your benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5678)|
| 1:34:47| I think there's, that reflects some measure of discontent with your teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| And your teachers are, of course, your, one of your number one priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5692)|
| 1:34:59| Commissioner, respectfully, I'm not sure I'd read too much into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| You know, I think there are multiple and many potential reasons why about 1,100 of our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| voted not to forego their raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| But it was about 1,100, and that's about a fourth of our teaching force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| So, you know, I think one can read too much into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| I think we have, we have, I have been in all 86 of our schools, both last year and this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| I was able to visit all of our schools and have been in many, many classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| And I have seen the outstanding work that our teachers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| I mean, we have extraordinary educators in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| And so, you know, I think this was not intended to be any kind of indictment of their work or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5736)|
| 1:35:44| value that they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| It was simply a recognition of these extraordinary times and the financial challenges that we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| And I think, you know, I think we have a terrific teaching force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| And I think we have a very strong relationship with both our teachers and with the KCEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| So, again, I would hesitate to read too much into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| I think, you know, there's a lot of different reasons that may have gone into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| But it was about a fourth of our teaching force that ultimately made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| I agree that it is a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| And maybe it could be easily read or misread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| And certainly I do agree that your teaching force is extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| And when I visit schools and the schools that I've been in, it's an incredible work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| And they're not, obviously, they're not money-centered by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| They wouldn't be in the profession if they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| But they can be pushed to a point where someone, where when you have something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5802)|
| 1:36:51| they're so risk-averse as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| And when I think about step increases, and those step increases are so pitifully small most of the time, many of them get none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5816)|
| 1:37:05| Certainly the older ones that get to the top of the range, they get nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| And so when I start to, I mean, it is, I can certainly understand the classroom teacher feeling the slap, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5830)|
| 1:37:21| of disrespect for someone to even offer that as a possibility for balancing a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| So that's just from somebody that's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| And respectfully, I think the irony, Commissioner, is that, you know, we've talked a lot about over my two years here that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| you know, and it's in our strategic plan that we recognize that the compensation for our teachers is not where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| You know, when we look at Oak Ridge and Maryville and some other surrounding counties, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| their salary schedules are $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 higher than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| And we lose a lot of talent to those school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| And so, you know, we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| We have noted in our strategic plan that we want to do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| We've put another, you know, at least $1.5 million over the next four years into strategic compensation under Race to the Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| So it's a recognition that, you know, that our teachers do provide extraordinary value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| and that they just, you know, that we really do need to over time look at how competitive their compensation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| and to do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| But this is just simply not the time when we have the capacity and the means to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| And so it was not, you know, the discussion was not one of disrespect or not recognizing their value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| It was simply one of we have a recognition that most of our money is in people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| and most of our people are in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| And so when you face an extraordinary budget challenge like we do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| there are very few options for us to get where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| And that gets us back to the point that when you say that most of your money is in people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| and most are in schools, and that is true when you look at the, you know, the cumulative aspect of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5936)|
| 1:39:04| And again, it's contended, you contend that central office is lean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| And so what we're doing with the request is just making sure, just using data to ensure that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5950)|
| 1:39:18| The only other, the last thing that I had a question about from the document that was sent was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5958)|
| 1:39:25| there's some other, apparently there's some other layers of administration that are not within this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| And so I also wonder about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| I think the instruction, everybody that's above the classroom, I mean the building level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5976)|
| 1:39:43| So I'm not really interested in information about principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| and assistant principals and teachers in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| But everybody that's above that building level, they're considered an administrator in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| So instructional coaches, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| I don't know how many people or how many layers there are between the building level and the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6000)|
| 1:40:08| Some of those people are in the AJ building and do their job from there and some may be in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| So I'd also be interested in those layers as well that are above the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6015)|
| 1:40:20| And we can certainly provide you with that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| Instructional coaches are experienced, excellent teachers who we tap to help our classroom teachers get better at what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| to help improve their instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| We have a substantial number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| We have, I think, in the neighborhood of about 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Of that, 11 are funded out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| And of that 11, we cut two this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| So, you know, we recognize the value of those positions and it's part of our strategy to improve instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6046)|
| 1:40:55| and the quality of education in our classrooms and a critical part of that strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| But even so, we've cut, you know, two out of the 11 positions that are funded in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| And again, that may be another innovation that's very worthy of the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| I'd like to keep my light on but defer to the others that have their light on on the educational part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6075)|
| 1:41:22| I was going to make some final comments and see if we want to move on to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| So I'll leave my light on and let some of the others speak if that's okay with the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Well, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| Yes, Dr. McIntosh, I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| We did get the list of the position changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| And the way I read it and from what you're the formulary that you use to determine how many teachers in each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6098)|
| 1:41:45| if it says RAF, which is reduction in force, this is no position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| If you were funded to 1.7, do these teachers come back if there's no position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| or are these positions that you've eliminated because of your formulary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| So I guess let me step back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| The way that we have allocated positions to schools is based on an allocation methodology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6119)|
| 1:42:06| a formula that we've put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| It has two main components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| One is enrollment and the other is the percentage of kids in poverty at that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| So it's basically a student-to-teacher ratio is how we calculate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| but it's stratified by percentage of kids who are eligible for free and reduced lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| So as Mr. Thomas said earlier, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| our definition of equity is that if you have two schools that have exactly the same enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| and exactly the same percentage of poverty, they'll have exactly the same budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| So what we've done is, you know, ideally that's a budget-neutral exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| You know, there might be some pluses and some minuses because enrollment shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| You know, some schools go up, some go down, but overall it's a net zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| Unfortunately, in this economic environment, that wasn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| ultimately that wasn't an option for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| and so we had to slightly adjust some of the ratios to get to about a net reduction of 30 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6174)|
| 1:43:01| I have tried to rely on the expertise and knowledge of our school principals to recognize what's going to work best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6181)|
| 1:43:10| in their school for their school community and for their kids around how we provide the most effective education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| and therefore, you know, within certain parameters, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| they have to be able to provide the education and the curriculum that's required by the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| and board policy, but if they fit within those parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| I've generally accepted their recommendations and the reductions they've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| Now, I've pushed back on some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| I've questioned some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| In fact, we've had a lot of conversation with the folks at Carnes Middle School about the position there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| and I'd still love to try to find a solution there, and we're still working to find a solution there, but ultimately it's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| My question is, though, based on your formulary, Carnes is going to lose a teacher if you were fully funded the 1.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| I believe Carnes Middle School was slated for two position reductions, and so it would-if we-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6233)|
| 1:44:01| So if you got the 1.7, that orchestra position still would be filled because the reduction, your formulary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| would eliminate those two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| That principal would still stick to those two choices, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| So if we got $1.7 million, that would get us to a net zero in terms of overall teacher reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| As I said before, there will still be some pluses and some minuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| Where enrollment's gone down, you're still going to see some, you know, reduction of position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| Where enrollment's gone up, you're still going to see an increase of position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| At Carnes, I think they had-they lost two, so if we made reductions, they might get one back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| and they'd have to make a decision as to which-what position they might put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| And by the way, you know, again, I'm relying on our principals to organize the resources that we give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| the most effective that they may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| So you may see a position that was cut in these reductions and they get a restoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| and they don't put back the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| They might put back a different position if it's going to better support the education of the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| in that school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| And again, I-not only do I think that's appropriate, I embrace that because I want our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| to make those kinds of decisions, to recommend those kinds of decisions to me around what they think is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| to be most effective for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| You went to the KCEA with your suggestion request for them to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| Can we do that with their health insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Because the state law allows them to opt out of the state plan if the county is similar or better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| I mean, our insurance is not the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| I mean, that state plan is just a Cadillac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| I mean, you don't pay anything, hardly out of pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| And so if they came to our insurance, the net savings would be in the hundreds of thousands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| maybe millions, if they would vote to come on to the county insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| My understanding is that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Mr. Thomas can probably speak better to the particulars of what the requirement is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| if they do that, and the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Because I think there is some history there of our attempting to do that probably before I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| A couple of years ago, we looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| That's not to say, again, it could not be looked at for future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| The teachers would have to vote, and you were correct in terms of looking at the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| that it would have to be equal to or better than the current plan that the teachers are on with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| Now, classified employees is a whole different scenario there because classified employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| although they're on the state plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| the board could make a decision for classified employees to be on the county plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| But it is a possibility, provided that the plan does match up with the state, that the teacher association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| they could vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| Now, the state plan is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| From what I understand, the state plan is going to change significantly next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| We don't know the specifics yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Is that January 1 they're changing or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| Yes, sir, January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| Actually, any rate changes and that sort of thing do come in the month prior to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| which would be the December paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| But the changes are effective January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| And can you estimate the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| I mean, you can't do it right now, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Can you estimate the cost of savings by putting the, as you say, classified, that's the non-certified, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| putting them on the county plan of insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| Yes, sir, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| I'd like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| While we have Dr. McIntyre and Mr. Thomas here, Commissioner Pinkston, do you have something for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6435)|
| 1:47:23| Not for Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| I just want to thank him for the job he's doing because I don't know whether you remember it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| but he let everyone know this was coming about six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| And I feel like he was really on his toes in foreseeing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| And I agree with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Again, I'm only dealing for this other thing they threw back over the fence at us, not you all, but school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6459)|
| 1:47:47| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| One for Mr. Thomas, and, you know, this is, I guess, a fundamental issue with Knox County, not just schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| but in terms of warehousing, massive amounts of toilet paper, soap, all of those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| I think that's, I think we've kind of grown past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| There's a process several companies use, you know, accelerated vending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| You know, because we're paying AC on that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| We're paying a floor space charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I'm sure these businesses out there will say, we'll warehouse this for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| and we will guarantee you an eight-hour delivery schedule or a 24-hour turnaround delivery schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| That way it's on them, and they'll give us competitive price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| It may not be $3 a case cheaper, but it may be $2 a case cheaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| and you're paying that premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| You know, it costs a lot in terms of securing this stuff, in terms of managing the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| You know, that way each school, you know, we have a lot of well programmers here that could program a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| It's not, you know, it's not rocket science to, hey, I'm running low on toilet paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| I'm down to my last case or whatever, that minimum, and it kicks in an order to a Staples or an Office Town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| So I'm just wondering why we aren't looking for, I don't even call them innovative ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6538)|
| 1:49:06| kind of present day ways of doing things like warehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| And Dr. McIntyre had pretty much given us that assignment, I guess several weeks ago, to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| And I don't, there's not any opposition on our part to do that, because if it can be done more efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| and be done cheaper, then certainly that's the route we need to look at in order to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| So we will give that much further consideration and try to look at what might be available out there, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6572)|
| 1:49:40| for just-in-time deliveries with paper towels, toilet paper, paper and that sort of thing, and as well the chemicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6580)|
| 1:49:48| So we'll look at that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| We'll look at that, yes, sir, and I'll provide that information to Dr. McIntyre so that he can make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6590)|
| 1:49:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| You know, and something came up earlier as we talked about, I know a lot of folks are mad at KCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| and I'm not necessarily mad at them because they aren't paid what comparable facility, well, excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6605)|
| 1:50:14| We always want excellence in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| That's what we all say up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| We're not paying our teachers at that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| So if we did not make this simply for the fact, and I know it's hard, but if we did not make this step increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| we're getting further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| One of these days, I want, and I've charged the superintendent, when things get better, believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| I'm not talking tax increases, do not take me to say that right now because we're in terrible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| we're in pretty dire straits, but it's been 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| When this economy turns around, we need to start compensating our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6643)|
| 1:50:49| You pay for what you value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| If we value our teachers, if we want this 90-10 program, we need to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6650)|
| 1:50:58| You know, one thing we don't say what the KCA did and other unions across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| they said that they will, for once, with this race to the top funds, allow themselves to be evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6664)|
| 1:51:12| and pay, potentially, pay, you know, appropriately, kind of like what happens with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| If I'm doing a bad job at ORNL, I won't get that percentage increase as opposed if I'm doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6678)|
| 1:51:24| So they've agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| And for a union to agree to that is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| Trust me, that's a so let's not, we can bring out our sticks and that's okay, too, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| that was a decision made, but I don't mind it for the fact that if we didn't do this step increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| we're just widening that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| And if we want to get our school systems to where it is, we definitely need to go in the opposite direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6704)|
| 1:51:53| And then a separate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Commissioner, if I may, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| And as I said to Commissioner Norman, you know, I think we do need to really think carefully about how we get to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| where we are more competitive in terms of the compensation of our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| And we've put in our race to the top scope of work, additional compensation in targeted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6725)|
| 1:52:12| And over time, you know, as it says in our strategic plan, we really do want to get to a place where we do pay our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6732)|
| 1:52:20| more competitively in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| And that's the irony is that that's where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| This is just, you know, a difficult fiscal environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| And so we were, you know, looking at some extraordinary measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| And, yeah, I think our teachers provide an incredible and enormous value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| And we need to make sure that we compensate them as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| We just aren't in a position to do that at this moment in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| But over time, I hope we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| And I hope to work with you in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| So two other quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| And one thing about that, having the teachers' pay be part of how their students are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| One of the dangers in that, and we all know, our kids don't always show up bright, happy, and chipper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| Some kids don't always show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| But they may show up on that test day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| So, you know, those scores go with the other scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| So this is a, I mean, it's a dangerous role for the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| So for them to agree to it, I think, I don't think we need to belittle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| I think that says something about their commitment to getting to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| And the last thing, I guess, is a challenge to you, well, two, the last thing on this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| Roy Mullins, I thought he was on contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| I don't see him here, and that may be part of what Tony was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| I don't see him on this list, but I think he was on the subcontract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| So if we could, if there's additional central office staff that's not showing up on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6818)|
| 1:53:45| My understanding of the request was for active employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Roy Mullins, in order to run for county, in order to run for school board, resigned as of sometime in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6827)|
| 1:53:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| But I thought these numbers were for kind of what was paid in FY08-09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Well, we can clarify if it was for active employees or if it was for all employees at that point in time or what the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| He's on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| I didn't see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| He's on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| And then the last thing is what do, I know we're not comparable to the Oak Ridges and Alcos and City of Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6854)|
| 1:54:27| How do we compare in terms of staff, central office staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| I'd like to get a comparison of that as well in terms of what their assistant superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| and what their directors of math and science, how that's compared to our neighboring higher paid counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6877)|
| 1:54:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| And just we can provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| We've done some of that analysis in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| We can provide some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| My sense of it is that we're about where many school districts are, maybe a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| Just to clarify, our, you know, most of our central office staff, with a few exceptions, are certificated employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6900)|
| 1:55:08| They're licensed teachers at one point in their career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| And so as with many school districts, as I understand it, in the state of Tennessee, their compensation is based on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| teacher's salary plus certain supplements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| And that's negotiated as part of the, has been negotiated as part of the discussion with the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6920)|
| 1:55:29| So those salary schedules, I believe, are, you know, a function of where our teachers are plus certain supplements on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6929)|
| 1:55:40| And I'll check with Mr. Thomas, make sure I got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| Well, if that's the case, then it should be woefully inadequate compared to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| We're basing it off of the woefully inadequate Knox County school teacher pay unless those supplements and extras bump it up to even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6949)|
| 1:55:57| So that's why I kind of like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| And, again, I know you said a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but woefully inadequate does not describe our teacher salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| I mean, they're not where they need to be yet, but they are relatively competitive with our regional school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| We just need to do some more work to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| You know, the top school districts in the region and the top school districts in Tennessee, we are not competitive with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| But we are above average in terms of the salaries that we pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| But my point is, I mean, the woefully inadequate point, if it's based on a teacher pay rate that's not where it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6984)|
| 1:56:34| I'd like to see how, if it does get up to that equal or slightly less than how that's done, what that formula looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=6994)|
| 1:56:48| Commissioner Wright, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| I do not have a question of the superintendent, but I'll make my 30-second comment and then we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| I appreciate the superintendent and his staff's hard and lengthy determination of where the school system is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7020)|
| 1:57:12| I know that commission appreciates you being here early with these numbers and allowing us to have such lengthy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7032)|
| 1:57:22| One of my comments, though, is to my, hold with me just a second, because I'm going to use them as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| My comment, the reason I have my light on, is because after a couple of hours of talking about this, that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| and the other in the budget process, the thing that comes to mind is I started to make a list of what I like and what I dislike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7054)|
| 1:57:45| And the only thing off the list that I want to really say to my fellow commissioners is the point that, this is on my dislike list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7065)|
| 1:57:56| I would appreciate it if we could refrain from, well, let's cut this so we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| I would like for this budget of Knox County to stand on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| That means all of its individual parts stand on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| We either need this line item or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| We shouldn't compare it against some other issue on some other page 40 pages away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| So if you like it, let's pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| If you don't like it, then let's do something with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| And let's not use comparisons to other line items of, well, this is more important than that or that's more important than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7105)|
| 1:58:35| Let's just move along and try to get the things in there that need to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| Because if it's tough times, that's the way we need to judge them, let them stand on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7120)|
| 1:58:47| This school budget issue is a huge thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| It's the largest part of what we're here to do today, tomorrow, next Monday, whenever we approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7131)|
| 1:58:58| The thing that I think to be ironic in the way it's being presented to us goes along the lines of a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7138)|
| 1:59:07| on something insignificant as split precincts and voting as brought to us by Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7147)|
| 1:59:14| We were asked, you don't have to leave, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| We were asked maybe as commission to sit here and not ask about how school board goes about determining how precincts are split or not split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7159)|
| 1:59:32| We were asked to not play in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| So what I'm building on is, I don't know what Dr. Briggs is going to bring to us in just a moment, but it does build on Commissioner McKenzie's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7175)|
| 1:59:44| we've got lanes of traffic here and do you want people playing in different lanes or do you want to do what I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7184)|
| 1:59:53| Now I'm back to the beginning of my rambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| Look at the budget as presented by the school board based on their estimates of income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7197)|
| 2:00:05| or where their money comes from and present a balanced budget and expect us as commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7205)|
| 2:00:13| to say we appreciate your balanced budget and we approve it as we've been ordered by court to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7213)|
| 2:00:23| A couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| As commissioners we've taken a couple of hours now and mainly we've talked about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7225)|
| 2:00:32| But I believe that Dr. McIntyre has said he has presented a balanced budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7232)|
| 2:00:39| and I would like to ask my fellow commissioners to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| And thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for the gathering last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| I found that very enlightening and I think we've got some questions at least on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| I'm not sure we all agreed on the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Several things that came up last Friday and certainly Commissioner Anders has mentioned a couple of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7264)|
| 2:01:11| and I think Commissioner McKenzie has as well, but the possibility of combining your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| with the benefits that the county enjoys right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| I know you all have looked at the second one before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| I implore you to look at it again and keep looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| I know there are difficulties and that is combining payroll in an effort to reduce costs there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7287)|
| 2:01:34| the possibility of outsourcing some custodial services, at least look at the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| if there is a savings there to be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| And then finally, an item that we talked about and I must say I was a little confused and remain so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7302)|
| 2:01:50| and that is the fund balance that you are drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| Given what you had indicated, it looked to me like and I think a couple of other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| that, in fact, there was a gap of about $4 million over the required 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7320)|
| 2:02:08| It's somewhere in the neighborhood of $11.5 or $12 million around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| So it looks like there is a gap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| You indicated to me on Friday that that difference was committed and I'm not sure what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| So there we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| But thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| And I think you have a fund balance analysis in your package that tries to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| And I'm not sure on all the accounting items that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7352)|
| 2:02:38| I'm the best expert, perhaps Mr. Thomas or Mr. McPherson are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| But what it tells me is that we anticipate, and as Mr. Troyer said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| you know, there's lots of projections and estimates that go into this because fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| by its nature, is sort of what's left over after you do your spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| And so there's lots of estimates and projections that go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| But our best thinking on it is that after all is said and done, we'll have about $3.5 million over the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| And we've committed in this budget that's been adopted by the school board about exactly $2.95 million of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7385)|
| 2:03:12| So there is, you know, there's potentially a little bit of wiggle room of about a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| But I think that's about one-eighth of 1% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| And because this is based on so many assumptions, I'm not sure we want to go any closer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7400)|
| 2:03:28| Well, I'm not suggesting we take it down to $12 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| but the fund balance estimate that we were given in the county proposed budget is right at $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7412)|
| 2:03:41| And if you take three-four of that, you still have $4 to $5 million or $3 to $4 million gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7421)|
| 2:03:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| And I don't think we have any issue with the $19.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| I think that's the first line on your fund balance analysis sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| It's the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| I think where the question comes in is, what are revenues going to come in this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| Where are our likely savings that might roll into fund balance from this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7441)|
| 2:04:06| And then what are the obligations around those fund balances that are still outstanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| I think that's probably the only areas where we might even have any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| I assume we'd probably get to the same end result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| But I think the $19.1 million is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| I just don't think it reflects all of the dynamics that you need to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| when you get down to what's really available at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| Dr. McIntyre, I'm sure you need a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| I wasn't anticipating being here today, so I apologize for not being as prepared as I might otherwise have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| I thought you might need a little break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| I was going to let Commissioner Briggs go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| Here's something totally different, but if you could stay, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Yeah, this really isn't totally, not completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| There's a link here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| And I really appreciate Dr. McIntyre coming down today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| and I also appreciate the dialogue that's gone on over the past six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| There's no surprises here with this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| I think if there really is a surprise, it's that you were able to reduce it from $18 million or $19 million down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| what's really zero, even though the school board has asked for another $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| Really what I wanted to comment on is that most of the discussion thus far this morning has dealt with making cuts here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7516)|
| 2:05:24| or making cuts there, and we've not looked at the other side of that, which is increasing revenue somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7524)|
| 2:05:32| This doesn't directly have to do with the budget, but it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| We're going to have a vote coming up on the Midway project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| There was a vote a couple of years ago on the Hackney project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| I'm going to get the information from the development corporation on how much revenue was lost when Hackney located elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7543)|
| 2:05:53| other than Knox County, and I'm also going to have them get the difference in revenue between what's being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7553)|
| 2:06:00| what we're getting in taxes right now out in the Midway area versus the projected taxes if those properties are sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7560)|
| 2:06:08| If Hackney were here today, we wouldn't be having these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| There's been other developments in this county that have been turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| There's some that need to be turned down for very good reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| but we can't put a fence up around the county and say we don't want businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| we don't want good residential development because it's having an impact now on schools, on education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| on some of the cultural organizations in the county that do contribute to the quality of life here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7590)|
| 2:06:38| I don't think we can necessarily take a short-term view on this, which is maybe two or three years down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7598)|
| 2:06:44| I think we have to look 10, 15, 20, and even 30 years down the line because the decisions that we make on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7604)|
| 2:06:52| will have an impact for years to come, not even on the children that are in school today, but also on their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| So I do ask you not to try to completely separate all of these decisions because they are related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7618)|
| 2:07:05| It all gets down to money, it all gets down to financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| and if we turn around economic development, not only do our children have to move away to find decent jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| but there's not the revenue there even to educate them to prepare them for jobs even elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7633)|
| 2:07:19| And that was the comment I really wanted to make on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| We're always talking about cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Maybe we need to look at trying to increase our revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| and just take a long-term look rather than a short-term look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7646)|
| 2:07:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| Mr. Chairman, in the essence of time, I'll just see Dr. McIntyre and Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| I'll just catch you guys a little bit later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| A quick question for Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| I just don't know what this is and just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| On the side of the balance sheet for the increases, 1,180,000 for kindergarten intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| It says funded but not, but new but funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| So, first of all, let me just say to Commissioner Saunders, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| The fund balance analysis is not in your packet, so I'll make sure that's transmitted to you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| and I hope that will clear up any confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| My apologies for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| In terms of kindergarten intervention, Commissioner Schaaf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| that is a very successful program that has been in place for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| but it's been in place through the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| And if you may recall, I came before you a couple months ago when that transaction was occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| to transfer those funds and that program from the Great Schools Partnership to the Knox County Schools budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| The idea is that over time, as was suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| we'd like to see the Great Schools Partnership become more of a local education fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| which means that it's more reliant on foundations and private donors than it is on public funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| And so we thought that one of the first things that we have to do successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| in order to allow the Great Schools Partnership to make that transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| is to show that it really is an incubator of innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| and that when the programs mature, that the programs are transferred to the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| and they become our own within the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| So kindergarten intervention is a program that takes advantage of the schedule that we have in our elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| where kindergartners finish their school day at 1 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| and the rest of our kids finish at 2.30 or 2.45, so our teachers are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| And so for kindergarten students who are struggling or at risk of falling behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| we keep a half dozen or eight of them for about an hour, an hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| after the 1 p.m. dismissal to work with them in small groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| and help them build their skills around literacy and numeracy and social skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| Is that funded privately then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| No, it was funded through the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| And so it was funded through the general fund appropriation that went to the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| But then the transfer was made so that both the dollars and the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| went from the Great Schools Partnership to the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| So it really is, it's a transfer of, it's an additional revenue source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| but it's also additional obligations of $1.18 million that come along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| Is it available across the board at all elementary schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| At most of our elementary schools, almost all of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| It's based on the deployment and the program is based on where the most at-risk kids are who need the intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7814)|
| 2:10:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| I also wanted to thank Brad for bringing up the issue earlier about the TAG program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| I don't know if I had to step out for a few minutes for another meeting, and I'm just now back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7836)|
| 2:10:43| and I was trying to watch on TV at the same time, so I didn't miss anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| But I know that at Beaumont Elementary, the kids that are in the honors program there often move on to a private school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7846)|
| 2:10:57| for middle school because there is no continuation of the honors program at the middle school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7857)|
| 2:11:04| And the closest we've got is the TAG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| So I'm really concerned that we're already losing good students to private schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| because they aren't being adequately challenged in the public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7874)|
| 2:11:18| So I'm afraid this restructuring TAG or watering it down or whatever may actually have an adverse effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7878)|
| 2:11:28| And also I wanted to throw out –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| If I may, and Mr. Thomas spoke a little bit about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| but this is actually something that – this is a restructuring that we think is an improvement in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| and by the way, it saves us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| So it's – in some ways, we think advantageous in both ways, educationally and financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| The idea is, as Mr. Thomas said, TAG has been a pullout, and it's been a pullout for –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| if it's a pullout program, it's for a limited number of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| One of the things that I've heard very frequently in the last two years since I've been superintendent here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| is that we do a great job with kids who are struggling academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| We do a very fine job with kids who are sort of in the middle of that continuum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| but we don't challenge our students who are at the high end of academically enough, that we need to do more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| The idea here is to restructure and really reconfigure the positions that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7935)|
| 2:12:22| the 17 positions that we have in TAG, to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| One, to be a push-in sort of integrated program, so that part of the job of these reconfigured positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7945)|
| 2:12:32| will be to do the types of – offer the types of educational activities and experiences that might –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| some kids might have experienced in a TAG classroom, but in the regular education setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| So a regular education teacher might take a reading group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| The rest of the class might be with a TAG teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| There'd be some direct instruction, and again, those sort of high-level, critical thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| creative thinking types of activities that we like so much about TAG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| to have that for a broader array of kids in our regular education setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7975)|
| 2:13:00| The other part of their job is to work with adults, to work with teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| so that they can share those types of educational strategies and instructional strategies that have been so –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| that our TAG teachers do so well to challenge our kids intellectually and to push our kids intellectually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7991)|
| 2:13:17| and so that all of our regular education teachers will have that skill set and be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| and differentiate their instruction and really challenge our kids at the high end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| So I think educationally, it's an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| It's – a lot of what's in the research around Talented and Gifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| and sort of the best practice around Talented and Gifted is reflected in this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| but it also makes those positions eligible for Title II-A funding, which is the teacher quality grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8017)|
| 2:13:44| and that saves us some dollars on the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| So I think it's an improvement both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| And I know there's some trepidation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| I know there's some concern about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| But, again, I think we're trying to improve the program while we save dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| Well, I certainly hope that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| And, I mean, you know, I'm anxious to see how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| But, again, the bringing it to more people I think is one of the reasons that the magnet program is not done as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8042)|
| 2:14:09| at the middle and senior high levels because there was a lot of tension between the magnet kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8049)|
| 2:14:17| getting all of this extra stuff that the zoned kids didn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| And then when they tried to open it up so that everyone was benefiting, the magnet program really suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8060)|
| 2:14:28| And that's, I think, another reason that we don't see a lot of magnet elementary kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| moving into the magnet middle and high school programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| So I hope that this is different than how that has worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| I have a different perspective on magnet, but I guess in words of my judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| I guess as a parent who's had two children go through the magnet program, this has been not just our experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8084)|
| 2:14:49| but the experience of a lot of parents of other students who have gone through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| So it does look a little different from where the parents sit, I'm sure, than from where the school board sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8094)|
| 2:15:00| And that's something that Andy and I have talked about a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| My perspective is not unlike yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| It's just that I don't think our magnet schools have been as successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| because I don't think we've ever fully embraced the magnet concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| I would agree with you on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| I think that we've had some ambivalence about the purpose and the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| and I think that we really need to decide that we're going to do magnet schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| and if we're going to do magnet schools, let's do them right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| And also I wanted to thank you all for setting up the two public forums you had last week on magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| We went to the one on Tuesday, and it was fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| Another thing when we're talking about thinking outside the box solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| and again, guys, I'm not advocating this or saying it's a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| but I know that when you start thinking beyond what you normally consider to be reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| or maybe reasonable is not the right word, but it can stimulate creative thinking in other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8150)|
| 2:15:58| and you can sometimes come up with even more and better ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| But there are some districts where the school board has their own taxing authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8161)|
| 2:16:06| and they are responsible for raising the money that they spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| Now, I've talked to different people in the county about that before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| and the school board hasn't wanted it because this way if they don't have enough money for the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8173)|
| 2:16:20| it's very easy to say, well, the county commission is not funding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| And people who I've talked to, other people in the county who say that the commission would never go for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| because the schools are 60% of our budget, and if we turn that over to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| then we've cut our political power by 60% because we're just left paying for sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| libraries, courts, all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| So it does really dilute the political clout, I think, of commissioners when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| But, again, that's a very outside-the-box kind of thing to be thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| and I'm not necessarily advocating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| I'm just saying when we start looking at radical ideas, it can sometimes stimulate some creativity in our thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8215)|
| 2:17:02| and make us come up with something that's even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| So I just wanted to throw that out there as something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| Commissioner Pinkster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| Yes, I'm going to say something here I hate to say because I really like the guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| but I'm going to have to disagree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| It is our job on this budget here to look and put our priorities in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8239)|
| 2:17:26| Some things we can do without and some we can't, other than just floating it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8246)|
| 2:17:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| The next question is for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| John, this delinquent tax attorney, are we talking about hiring our own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| I'm glad you brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| Our thought process on that is it's been talked about for a number of years that that has been an outside legal firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8263)|
| 2:17:50| What our thought process was is that we wanted to give the trustee's office the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8270)|
| 2:17:57| to employ someone from the law director's office to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| State law is very clear that says that that authority is within the trustee's office to make the hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| and so that would be an agreement between the trustee's office and the law director's office to work that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| and we didn't want to spell out or dictate what they would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| but to give them an opportunity to make that choice if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| I just wondered how you come up with this $177,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| It's one attorney and one pair of legal plus benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| I just wondered that because I thought that fell under the trustee's jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| Another thing here, I've heard several people talking about the administrative staff over in the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8316)|
| 2:18:43| We're creating a monster over here in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8323)|
| 2:18:47| I don't know whether most people realize it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| but the administration has almost doubled in the last seven and a half years in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| It's gone from roughly $600,000, a little over $600,000, to $1,178,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8337)|
| 2:19:05| We've got some jobs in there that were created that we've done without for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| The chief of staff, the chief administrative officer, those are awful high-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8351)|
| 2:19:22| We have 27 appointed jobs over here that are over $100,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8362)|
| 2:19:32| Now, I realize that you say these people are qualified and we need qualified people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| but there are a lot of people out there now that are even more qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| that would be willing to take these jobs for $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| We need to look at these, maybe cutting some of these positions out that we've created in the last seven and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8384)|
| 2:19:52| We've got to get this under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| And I hate to be saying I told you so, but it's going to be worse next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8394)|
| 2:19:59| Now, 50% of our sales tax revenue goes to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| With John's own admission right here, and I believe it's more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| I asked what our expenditures were and our revenues were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| We're already $10 million behind right now for this year, using his figures, 80 and 83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8412)|
| 2:20:20| So we've got to make some cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| I don't know where, but we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| Now, I've named some things off here that we essentially don't even need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8426)|
| 2:20:34| I know a lot of you new commissioners here probably don't like getting rid of discretionary funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8434)|
| 2:20:42| but I've talked about that ever since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| I feel like that's used to buy votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| I've been against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| Now, I take it because everybody else takes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| But these things need to be cut out, especially in this day and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| Now, if times get better, we can put these things back into our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| But right now, it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| Question, John, on this tax attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Is this a commission response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| I mean, is this under our jurisdiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| I think it is that we can allocate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| Well, by placing it in the budget, then we place it in the commission's jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| And so the choice as to who gets to be employed for the tax attorney resides with the trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8485)|
| 2:21:32| and that was our sense is the trustee would be able to make that choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| and we were hoping that they would choose somebody from the lottery actor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| They work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| Do we have any figures as to how much the tax attorney has made in the last three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8503)|
| 2:21:51| I think we'd need to get those numbers from the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| I'd like to request that, Mr. Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| if you could ask the trustee's office to provide you with the last three years what the tax attorney has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8516)|
| 2:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8524)|
| 2:22:12| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| Yes, this question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| Are we going to take a lunch break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| I was hoping we might be finished today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8546)|
| 2:22:27| I think your answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| Was your question, Mr. Hammond, about what the private attorney has made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| Was that what your question was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| Yes, I was just wondering if we could find out just what, from the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| what the delinquent tax attorney has made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| and I guess if we could find out figures of how much delinquent taxes have been collected, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| I'm not interested in his salary as a private person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| I'm interested in what he has brought in in terms of our taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| We're just on general government questions for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8586)|
| 2:23:13| I've got a couple of pension questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| I know Commissioner Briggs said we wouldn't be sitting here if Hackney was sitting here arguing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8595)|
| 2:23:20| or not arguing, debating over trying to find a million seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| If Hackney was still out there, we certainly wouldn't if the pension thing wasn't hanging over us out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| I think, just correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| I just want to get some of these right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| Dr. McIntyre's budget, roughly $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| 5.7 TCRS and $300,000 in the closed city plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| So $6 million, a third of your shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| And you and, of course, I sit on the pension board with you and Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| He asked you about the $1.2 million earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| It is stated out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| It's on your page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| A little newer eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| $1.2 million must be included to shore up the county's O defined benefit pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8637)|
| 2:24:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| And that includes some O city teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| Or is that just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| No, those are without the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| That's without the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| The $300,000 is the city teachers that he's short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| Also, when you touch on that 1.2, you mentioned here's something that we, I think, lose sight of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8656)|
| 2:24:22| In addition to employees' contribution of 6% of pay and over $4 million in debt service payments already committed for 2010-11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8662)|
| 2:24:29| that's $4 million in debt service on the $57 million in bonds sold to fund UOP, am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8669)|
| 2:24:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| When it first hit three years ago or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| Where is, and I only know this because I'm on the pension board with the other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| The UOP subsidy is about $4.5 million this year, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| I see it's sort of disguised because it's a payroll subsidy and not an actual black and white number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| It's in the sheriff's department budget, and so they have retirement as a line item and it's included in their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8695)|
| 2:25:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| So it inflates the sheriff's department budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| It distorts the inflation of the sheriff's department's budget because that's something that's totally beyond the control of the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8706)|
| 2:25:13| or of anyone except the market forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| The function of their staffing, and that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| But generally speaking, am I right if I'm saying $4.5 million for UOP subsidy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| I think that's right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| I see it's funded at 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| And that number basically comes from Bob Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| That's not a number you came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| That's a number that the actuary said, here's what you do to keep you at 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8737)|
| 2:25:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| And he makes a recommendation each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| Last year's number was 16%, and it's dropped to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| But what he's done is he has employed a number of actuarial techniques to smooth the effect of the decrease in the stock market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8749)|
| 2:25:58| And so what that means is that how long it's going to take to build out of that is going to be much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8758)|
| 2:26:06| The five-year average or ten-year, just an average factor, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| And it's still using a 7.5% growth assumption rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| Which is probably optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8775)|
| 2:26:16| And so it's a long road to go yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| So just for perspective purposes, 6 million school board, 4.5 UOP, 10.5, 1.2, I'd push it nearly to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8781)|
| 2:26:35| And in debt on the UOP is another 4, so that's 16 million directly into pension subsidies and underwriting and debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8795)|
| 2:26:46| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| It's expensive, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| Let me ask you a fund balance question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| You know, our meeting we had sort of sparsely attended there Friday about the investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8813)|
| 2:27:02| 3% of the school's fund balance and I guess 3% of 375 million is what, 10 or 11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8822)|
| 2:27:09| Is that 10 or 11 or I think you said 19 million, is that included in the investable funds that we were debating what to do with Friday at lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8829)|
| 2:27:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| Follow me, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8840)|
| 2:27:21| Is the school board fund also included in those investable dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| So that gives us roughly the 40 million, 30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| Yeah, that was our vote to go from a 30 million to a 36 million core account and to take a piece of operating funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8853)|
| 2:27:41| the collective operating funds and be able to invest those a little bit longer term and try to take advantage of some interest rate bump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8861)|
| 2:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8871)|
| 2:27:52| I guess that's why there's a school board representative on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| And so the interest earnings are apportioned appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| And let me know if I'm missing, if that 16 million number is not a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8884)|
| 2:28:09| I mean, if anything, it's probably low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8891)|
| 2:28:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| Hi, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| Can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| So this year, the sheriff's pension plan, how much of an impact is that on our tax rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8900)|
| 2:28:28| From what, just to review the numbers from Commissioner Shouse, it's about $4.3 million that's in the sheriff's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8908)|
| 2:28:36| another $4.5 million in debt service, and then on top, I guess that's the county's portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8916)|
| 2:28:44| Pushing a dime probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| We're looking at about $9 million, just short of $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| So we're, well, somewhere $0.29, $0.10 on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| Commissioner Shouse, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| I think our procedure for tomorrow, we have intergovernmental procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| Yes, public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| We're supposed to go back into budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| Then at 2 o'clock, we have the department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8963)|
| 2:29:30| I think we have a luncheon and also a pension board for some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8970)|
| 2:29:39| I guess the question that I want to ask is about the hearing after procurement, the budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8979)|
| 2:29:49| Do we need that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| Do you have some more questions we need to ask amongst ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8991)|
| 2:29:55| Are you speaking of the 2 o'clock meeting, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=8995)|

| 2:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| My question is, do we need to have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| I think let's go ahead and have what we're going to have at 2 at 10 and just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| and have the department heads down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9038)|

| 2:30:41| Has it been publicized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| Well, it's been publicized for 2, so I think we need to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| Yeah, I think we need to leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| Well, we can go ahead and do it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| If no one has any questions at 10 for the ones that are here, we'll just dismiss and we'll go to lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| and then have the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100517publichearing?start=9057)|
