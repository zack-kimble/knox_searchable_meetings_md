| 0:01:04| Nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker, would you lead us in a pledge of allegiance to our flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Would everyone please rise and face our nation's flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=80)|
| 0:01:28| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| I know we've got quite a few visitors today, and we may have some folks who are tuning in from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| My fellow commissioners have usually seen me do this at every meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| but I do want to, for the purpose of those who may be watching for the first time or for some of our first-time visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=106)|
| 0:01:53| kind of just give you a brief overview on the reason we have county commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| where the work session differs between the voting session next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| Knox County Commission meets normally on exceptions when there's a holiday like we had yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| usually on the third and fourth of Monday of each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| The first meeting is considered a work session, and that's the meeting that we have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| At tonight's meeting, we'll be taking a first path through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| We are going to basically be discussing some items and deciding which items need to be placed on our consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| which means that they'll all be voted on at one time next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| and then we will probably pull some items or send some items forward to next week's Board of Commissioners meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| that have been sent forward with no recommendations so that they can be voted on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| So that's kind of how the process is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| So notice tonight I'm going to call out the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| We'll formalize the agenda and then go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| I also want to say tonight a couple other special things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| We have three different discussion items or presentations for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| As I posted in the county commission forum, we're going to move those three items to the beginning of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| in order to get through those before we move on to the other items that we're going to be debating and voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| But before all of that, we do have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| Before public forum, and I've got two guests who are going to speak at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| I do want to recognize Commissioner Jay, who has some very special guests with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| I wanted to recognize and welcome members from the Jack and Jill of America and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| This is part of the MLK Celebration Week that really focuses on a great event on Saturday of the King Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=220)|
| 0:03:49| which is the oratorical contest, and essentially this organization helps enable and empower young people to find their voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=229)|
| 0:04:01| and to find ways to learn public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| My wife and I have been supporters of it for the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| and are happy to invite them as they come and learn a little bit more about county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| So if you all would please stand and be welcomed and accepted by everybody here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| and we want to thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=256)|
| 0:04:26| We appreciate that you've taken the time to learn a little bit more about your county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| and look forward to seeing you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Next item on our agenda is public forum, and we have two citizens who'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| The first is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Keith, if you could please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| You've got five minutes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Thank you. Keith Britt, 558 North Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| Democratic House, a Republican Senate, President Trump rarely agree on anything except for one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=299)|
| 0:05:08| Earlier in this last budget cycle, they all came together and say what's best for our economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| and what's best for families is to provide federal employees with paid family leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| This was shocking to me. I did not see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| I about fell out of my chair when Governor Lee came through a few weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| and said 38,000 state employees are going to be provided with the same 12 weeks of paid family leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=327)|
| 0:05:36| From what we're seeing on social media, from Republican leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| from some bills we're seeing created by Representative Johnson on the Democratic side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| or excuse me, Senator Kyle on the Democratic side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| it looks like that's going to be expanded to more state employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| It seems all but a certainty that in the city of Knoxville, American Cannon and the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| are going to be providing some type of paternity leave or family leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| That hasn't all been ironed out yet. I haven't seen any details on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| but that seems like an all but a certainty coming online in this April budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| So that makes me kind of wonder what level of government still isn't providing that for their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| So I start looking at Knox County, and Knox County provides zero paid family leave to its employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| You exceed FMLA guidelines slightly for unpaid leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| but there's zero paid family leave for school teachers, sheriff's deputies and administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=392)|
| 0:06:43| Our apologies, Keith. Mr. Britt, we've had some issues here with these microphones lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Quite all right. Knox County employs roughly 11,374 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| Approximately 70% of those are women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| I did a little bit of analysis to show you how much this would potentially cost you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| if you were to implement 12 weeks of paid family leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| For my analysis, we considered everybody working a 30 year career from ages 20 to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| We used an average annual salary of $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| We used the U.S. national average of 1.81st per lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| and we considered all employees having all their children in the first 15 years of their career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| Using these figures, it would cost Knox County $8.8 million annually to implement a 12-week paid family leave program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=455)|
| 0:07:44| That seems like a big number in isolation if it's just a line item, but that's 1% of your annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| If you wanted to go a little softer than that, if you wanted to do six weeks paid family leave instead of 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| that gets you down to a half percent of your annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I will stress the parameters I used for this were extremely aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| A lot of people were having a lot of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Those are probably top-level numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| You're probably going to see 75%, 50% of that at most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| I think those numbers do start to show you what the relative cost would be for encouraging businesses to relocate to this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=499)|
| 0:08:30| encouraging young, talented people to move to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| It's going to reduce health care costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| We're going to see reductions in depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| We have seen some studies showing this will put a dent in the opioid crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=521)|
| 0:09:03| I've done a rudimentary analysis of what this would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| I think we at the county level are the only level of government that I am represented by that's not doing this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=549)|
| 0:09:18| I know you can't just say let's do this now, but please start looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| I don't have access to the data needed to really do a rigorous cost estimate on this, but you certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Thank you, Mr. Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Next, we have Stephen Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| Stephen, if you could just state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| My name is Stephen Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| I live at 937 Anatole Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| Mr. Bussler is my county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| I communicated with him and Mr. J about the subject matter being unhappy about the decision to accept refugees in the Knox County area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=599)|
| 0:10:12| What I was unhappy about specifically, I have opinions on it, but what I was unhappy about was that that was a decision made by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=612)|
| 0:10:22| I believe government is better for the governed the closer to the governed that you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=622)|
| 0:10:30| In other words, ask people's opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Find out what they're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| Address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| If there is no addressing the concerns and it comes up to basically a coin toss, then perhaps the county commission or the mayor may have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=636)|
| 0:10:46| My understanding by research was that no discussion was done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| I think we've seen how large portions of the state have reacted to the governor's decision to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| I don't think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| There's voices not heard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| The citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Nobody asked us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| We're really getting to a time in our lives with the government where there's just a lot of stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| They could ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| I know more now than I've ever known before quickly because I've got a cell phone and I've got Instagram and Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| My grandkids all have phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| My kids have phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| It seems like we should be able to communicate with each other a little bit more quickly, a little more accurately with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| So I'm not asking that one opinion over another be preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| I'm not offering an opinion about whether we should accept refugees into the county or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| What I'm asking is, can we have the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| And is it something that Mayor Cain should be making that decision on or should it be the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| And that's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Thank you, Mr. Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| Once again, for everyone in the audience, we are having some A.V. difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| I'm also sure that there's about 82 dogs in downtown Knoxville that are probably freaking out right now every time that microphone kind of goes out like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=723)|
| 0:12:12| The next step on our agenda is we're at the point where we will do the amendments to the agenda, which is where we actually set what we're going to go over tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=732)|
| 0:12:23| I'm sure my fellow commissioners have seen the draft agenda, but we have four items that need to be voted on to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=743)|
| 0:12:33| And that is items 35, 43, 44, and 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=753)|
| 0:12:50| We also have item 37, which will be deferred to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=770)|
| 0:12:58| On the non-consent agenda, these were items that were detailed on the commissioner's form online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| Non-consent is item 8, 22, 23, 30, 32, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=785)|
| 0:13:35| 45, 46, and 47. To my fellow commissioners, are there any additional items that you'd like to have pulled from the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=815)|
| 0:13:47| Okay, seeing none, could I have a motion to set tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Okay, I have a motion from Commissioner Geale and a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| All opposed, please say nay. Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| I'm sorry, I'm looking down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Oh, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| I would like to point out my five years and four months on this commission, this is the lightest school board number of items I think I've ever seen on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=848)|
| 0:14:18| Yeah, it was very light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| At first, I thought it was a typo, so that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| So, and once again, all voted in favor to set the agenda as reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| The chair will entertain a motion to approve the minutes from the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| I have a motion from Commissioner Jay, who was the second on that? Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| Okay, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| I just want to point out, did we do a vote on the setting of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Yes. Yep. Yep. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| So, and we were at the approval of the minutes, and we had a motion by Commissioner Jay, a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| As I mentioned in the forum, what I'd like to do is we've got some very important presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I'd like to get some of the presentations knocked out here at the beginning of the agenda before we move into the work part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| So, the first item on that presentation was the roll call voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| I think Commissioner Buster brought that to our attention back in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| So, Commissioner Buster, would you like to go ahead and tee this up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I know Zach has been working on it, and they're ready to go to lead this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| If you were sent a link to put on your computer, GoToMeeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| He's afraid to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| There was a link sent to each one of you all to put an app on your system to see how it works, and it says GoToMeeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| I think it was sent to you by email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Just for a question, Dale, may I ask, who was the sender? Was that from you or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| From roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Yeah, I got it, but my computer went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| When it pulls up, it will come on your screen like on this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| It says have a great meeting. It says start your free trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| I think Drusilla forwarded it, so if you're looking for an email from roll call itself, it was forwarded by Drusilla on Friday at 1036 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=983)|
| 0:16:33| Can we just do it over the web, or do we have to have an app?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=993)|
| 0:16:56| We don't really need to download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1016)|
| 0:17:05| All right, fire away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| A quick point of order question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Zach, computer, audio, or phone call? I guess computer, audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Are we all going to have all our computers kind of make a noise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Ignore all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Ignore all that, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Zach, do we need to hand this meeting over to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Sorry, I'm a little bit late to the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I'm teleconferencing in the gentleman that Commissioner Bussell has been working with now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| Here's the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Are you there? Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| Okay, the floor is yours, Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| This is Victor Cluck with Roll Call Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| And I don't know if you hear it, but I hear an echo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Welcome to Amarillo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| Well, I certainly appreciate your making time on your agenda to see Roll Call Pro and to participate in this interactive demo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1077)|
| 0:18:08| I have about ten minutes, no more than ten minutes of structured content to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| And I promise none of it's in PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| But, of course, you may have questions, and we'll just follow your questions wherever they lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| I don't know how much time you've allocated for this presentation on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| Well, can you try to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| I think we're probably talking about ten, 15 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| I mean, Commissioner Bussell, do you think that would be fair on this, 15 minutes or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| That's more than enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Ten minutes for the presentation and five minutes for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| The five minutes of questions may happen sort of interspersed in those ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| because I'm going to stop and turn on a dime if I hear a question and try to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| But the first thing I'd like for you to do is to get out your device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| and get into the Roll Call Systems member app and connect the way Commissioner Jay has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1141)|
| 0:19:11| If you can see the public screen that has the Knox County logo in the upper left, you'll see a list of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| We call this our name grid on the public display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| And what you need to do in order to log in is to connect to the IP address where I am right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| enter your login ID, which is your first initial and last name, all lower case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| and then the password is password, all lower case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| Where do we click for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| I'm looking at that screen right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Where do you click for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Do you have your devices in your hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| I'm looking at it on a laptop, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Well, the laptop, if it's showing a list of names, starting with Commissioner Gill down to Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1197)|
| 0:20:07| that's just for you to view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| What I'd like for you to do is to use a phone or a tablet to log in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| following the directions that were in the email that I distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1216)|
| 0:20:35| Not everyone has to do this, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Just like every other person so that it's easy for a pair of you to see a screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1238)|
| 0:21:09| If you're looking for the app in one of the stores, either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1269)|
| 0:21:17| you want to search for roll call, that's all one word, space systems, space member, space app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1277)|
| 0:21:28| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Can I suggest that maybe while everybody's downloading their app, since we have a couple of presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| if the gentleman on the phone is willing to hold that we move on to the next presentation while everybody downloads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| because that might be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| Sir, are you okay with that while everybody's getting this app on their phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| We can call you right back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| We're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Are we there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Sure, that's just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1313)|

| 0:22:01| Let's see where everybody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| All right, I think I'm in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Join meeting as and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| I think we can figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| I think we're up just about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| If you want to join the GoToMeeting, you want to log in to Roll Call Pro using an app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1336)|
| 0:22:40| Basically, you want to do what Commissioner Jay has done on whatever device he's using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1360)|
| 0:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1391)|
| 0:23:33| Everybody, you're logging in to GoToMeeting, and that's not where I want you to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| I want you to be on a device like a phone or a tablet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| and I want you to download the Roll Call Systems Member app and launch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| I see Commissioner Gill, Chair Nystrom logged in to GoToMeeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| and that's not really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| All right, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1443)|
| 0:24:21| Roll Call Systems Member app, I guess that's what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1461)|
| 0:24:29| I don't think it will work on there, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| It's taking forever to load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1475)|
| 0:24:57| Jack, is it possible for you to log in on this thing and do the presentation as yourself up on the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1497)|
| 0:25:17| See, mine won't even recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1517)|
| 0:25:31| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| All right, I'm going to give everybody a chance to try to download this app and then move on to the next presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| We'll come back to this in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Sure, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| The next item on our agenda, Madam Clerk, what was the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| The Community Coalition Human Trafficking presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Mr. Anders, would you mind introducing that presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Is Katie here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I have not seen Kate Trudeau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Kate doesn't work there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| It's Natalie Iovy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Is Natalie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| I don't see Natalie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| I think they're coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| All right, we'll move that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| All right, we'll move that to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Why don't we next move on to the presentation on the Greenway presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1571)|
| 0:26:27| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Shawna Godlewski, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| I work with the Parks and Recreation Department, and this month we have the Greenway Corridor Study up for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| Tonight we have two gentlemen here from Gresham Smith who have both worked on the project, and they're going to give you a brief presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| Can we get the PowerPoint loaded, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| And if you could state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| My name is Patrick Fibash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I'm a 2095 Lakeside Centerway with Gresham Smith here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1621)|
| 0:27:15| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Thank you all so much for a time to get together today and speak to you all about our Knox County Greenway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1637)|
| 0:27:26| This project came about as an initiative to help give you guys a guidebook and a tool to be able to help plan and construct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1646)|
| 0:27:37| and just look at different areas of where we can put greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| So today I'm going to talk about quickly a project overview, some recommended alignments, and then some quick implementation that we have done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| And so we had four corridor studies for this project, and it's approximately 65 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1677)|
| 0:28:20| We got out there and we walked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| We got in Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| We walked out in Heartland Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| We walked down Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| So we were able to get out there and slip our boots on the ground and look at these corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| So we want to make sure that we give you guys the best plan that we can give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| And so as part of the Greenway Study, we have held public meetings with over 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| And so as part of that meeting, we're able to show them, like, what are your priorities for a greenway system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| And here you're going to see the top three rankings of improving connectivity, safety, and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1736)|
| 0:29:04| And so it's really cool to get out in the street and let people see what it is that I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| And so we say, hey, what kind of greenway do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| And so here we get to see four different greenways that were mostly anticipated to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| And so you're going to see greenways similar to what we have in Knox County today out there in the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| As you go along Beaver Creek, you're going to search the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| You can go into the neighborhoods, and the next thing you know, you're along the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| And so people wanted to see the natural areas, parks, connected schools, and different areas like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| And so as part of the public meeting process, we were able to have a website for people to go to and comment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| Not everybody's able to get out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| And so as you can see on this map, we had over 80 people log in to the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| and they were able to leave comments, draw little routes, and maybe a section that they would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| And so this was a valuable tool for us to use in the boardroom today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| All right, so I'm going to jump into our different corridors and kind of some recommended alignments that we gave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| So first is Beaver Creek West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| Beaver Creek West is from Milton Hill Park all the way to I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| And so here it starts at Milton Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| And so the colors are going to be a yellow, a red, and a purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| And the yellow is our preferred route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Our red is an alternative route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| And our purple are connectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| So we want to make sure we're connecting things to these bridges and not just putting them out there by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| And so here we start in Hardin Valley, have the connection up to Milton Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| and make sure we connect them to the Hardin Valley Academy for the NDA program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| And here we continue along Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| We made sure we looked at the NOx-co-created freeway to tell you how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| We incorporated that into our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| And so we're connecting plants that have already been done to make sure that we're not overdoing the work again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| Connecting throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| We follow along Hardin Valley in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| We break off Hardin Valley and run over to the Congress Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| And here we got a pull-away from Henry Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| You know, it's Henry Road, and it's just a pull-away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| And the pull-away, because Henry is a tight two-lane road with a narrow right-of-way and very high residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1910)|
| 0:31:59| And it was such a hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| We had a lot of input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| It was a freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| So we put that in an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| Because in cards, people want the connection to these schools along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| And just the community development that's happening in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| So that's kind of where we pulled along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| And we're going to be breaking back up towards Herald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| It's not far from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| I'm here for rendering of kind of an anticipated freeway section here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| Oak Ridge Highway and Herald Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| They're a great stop and search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| So we're going to be a protective barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| And then some vegetation takes upper and then back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| So here we hopped into the balcony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| We know that it's a providing community with a freeway system that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| And we wanted to go ahead and enhance what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| So our community was really, really involved in this talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| Especially with wanting to do a section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| So we're going to make sure we're using Beaver Creek as kind of a jewel that's there in the Cal community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=1999)|
| 0:33:30| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2010)|
| 0:33:42| So this is Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| There's Beaver Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| And so this is an existing bridge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| And so this is kind of what we're anticipating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| People can use it to look out at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| They can go out and walk and enjoy it with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| And so for each section, there's a preliminary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| And it's a high-level process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| And we've devised tools to go out and grant project money to be able to say, hey, let's go ahead and build this section and this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2045)|
| 0:34:14| So if you go through the report that we have, you're going to be able to see the cost of different sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| So next, Beaver Creek East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| So Beaver Creek East is from I-75 all the way up to the Union County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| And so here we start at I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| And we were able to use all of Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| And there's an existing bridge that we just saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| We were able to follow Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Because everybody knows Beaver Creek Road is one of the busiest intersections in our county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| The state is looking to do an improvement at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Or greenway usability in some of the best places is just way too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| So that's the reason we came up with greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| And plus we wanted to highlight Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| And so this is kind of what we're thinking as we go along Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| This is a nice, concrete path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| This is a little concrete for Beaver Creek Busway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| I'm going to have you use it over the halls for your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| And it's got the ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| I know, I guess, where you're taking the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| And so, but I know it drives out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| You know, the concrete is going to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| And so you're going to see concrete as you go through this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| And here's another kind of rendering of just what it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| It's not just a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| It can be a place where people go out and sit down with their families and enjoy the beauty and what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| And so here we start into, we made it all the way into the halls community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| And there's already plans now of connecting the halls to the greenway over the railways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| And so we were going to build off that plan of the halls that are going to go downstairs and continue to follow the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2168)|
| 0:36:16| That's what the public wanted when I was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| The state has plans right now to widen Beaver Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| And then they have a greenway section along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| And so that can be used for community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| The Beaver Creek section can be used for community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| We're getting out and enjoying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| And so here we're coming to the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| And the Gibbs community is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| And we want to make sure that we are continuing to bring the aspect along the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| It is a new school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| A new school district has to be built out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| We want to have access to the kind of downtown community we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| And we want to give them access and connect everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| And so we really looked at that and got feedback from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| And if you follow Townsville Pike, that's the community county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| And there's a little pond out there along Platts Chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| It's going to be a really cool place for people to go hang out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| So you kind of got to see why we have that up there for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| And so here is another example of some cost estimates for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| If you look in the report, you're going to see, hey, we can do Section 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| The rest of it can cost $1,280,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| These are the complaining costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| As you guys continue to dive into that, we can also give those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| I'm going to let Mr. Matthews take over for the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2285)|
| 0:38:35| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2322)|
| 0:39:07| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| Here, again, we continue on North Shore Drive past Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| And I've got a lakeside center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| As I'm sure all of you know, the driveway there is a little bit tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| going sort of north up towards Wallace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| This is why we recommended a boardwalk section here to accommodate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| narrow walkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| So that allows everybody to construct a little bit of a straight there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| It also provides a really nice view of the area, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2377)|

| 0:44:17| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2657)|
| 0:44:25| next to the map, I just want to point out that the little boxes, the small boxes with the numbering next to various segments correspond to each of those cross-sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2665)|
| 0:44:37| And in your report, it's going to be located in each of those, so the key is that there, and I apologize for not mentioning that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| It's not working, Chief Secretary. It's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Oh, it's not working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| I can continue without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Just a couple of quick, clear remarks in terms of implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| We did a couple of implementations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Yeah, it's not a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| It's usually a health impact assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Knox County, like many communities throughout the country, is not a key problem for the populace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| The Knox County Health Department has less IVs, obesity, heart disease as major factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| One thing we all have in common is, you know, this might seem like a silver-bullet solution, but it is a partisan one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| I mean, Greenway is an action we should be taking forward as we play for that solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| The self-impact assessment looked at different socio-ecographic metrics that generally attract the public to the area or community or population to identify some segments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2723)|
| 0:45:35| of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| What I think maybe we can do is we can go through all the presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2737)|
| 0:45:46| I can hold my finger down for as long as I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| When we're done with that, we'll go and we'll redo it after the next presentation, and then we'll go on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| Just let me know if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| They can also promote new or redeveloped commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| One of the things we looked at was the estimated impact that Greenways can have on property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| Looking at a couple of different examples of peer communities around the country, the range varies from low 1% up to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2770)|
| 0:46:21| We can see property value increases within about a quarter mile of Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| Taking those findings, we stratified looking at low median increases for residential and commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| and low per resident would be 5% up to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2794)|
| 0:46:42| In summary, we looked at the most conservative potential increase in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| The co-road assessed value ranges from approximately $4 million in the South Maxx Corridor to about $40 million along North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| Since those increases obviously affect the underlying taxable value of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| additional revenue that can result from those increases range from approximately $400,000 in the South Maxx Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2819)|
| 0:47:07| up to about $850,000 in the North Shore Drive Corridor, or roughly $2.8 million in the annual property tax growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| That's at build-out, so obviously that's not all going to happen at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| but you could reasonably expect some property value and property tax increases in adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| Up on the slide now, the other thing we looked at were reports of visitor spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| The table on the right shows some examples that we looked at around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| from communities as small as Damascus, Virginia, to as large as Fort Worth, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| All three of the examples we showed here reported annual visitor revenue increases of about $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| in two adjacent businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Is that what we can expect for Knox County Freeway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| It's hard to say, but we could reasonably expect a positive impact on adjacent businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| In the graphic there, it just reinforces, that's an NC map of visitor attractions from the Tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| I apologize, I forgot the name of the Tourism Board, but anyway, we did have freeways going adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2883)|
| 0:48:13| to some major activities like Rocky Hill, Powell, and Chapel Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| Finally, next slide, finally we looked at project prioritization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| We have the RAP recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| We applied some prioritization criteria to activity, to equity, existing parks and greenways, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2906)|
| 0:48:35| and put all of that into a prioritization framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| What you see on the screen is an unweighted example of the top projects in each corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| but it's not a static tool, this is a living tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| We'll provide it to the Parks Department, and the various criteria can be weighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| to look at different priorities in the community or to pursue different types of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| With that, we conclude our presentation, and I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| My fellow commissioners, are there any questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| Okay, I'm going to take just a pause to check in with Zach on two matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| Zach, our feedback, I know Zach was on the phone with PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| and they were trying to reset the audio system remotely, which appears to have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Hey, Chairman Nystrom, I would just like to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| That was really detailed, and I really appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| and it shows the impact that something like this could have, and it didn't go unnoticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you guys so much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Yeah, and I might add, if any of you all were at any of the Greenway presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| when they were out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| one thing he mentioned was how the community members were sort of weighing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| Many of us have been in meetings with the stickers and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| and tried to vote with exactly what you'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| It was very clear that what he talked about, community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| I know when we had a work session out on the North Shore Drive area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| a lot of people came out multiple times, and it was very participatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| and you can see that in kind of these decisions, at least speaking just for the North Shore area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| So I think that's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| It appears that we've got our sound back up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| and I also believe we've now got most of the folks have successfully downloaded that app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| So I guess, Zach, are you ready for us to move back into talking about the presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| By the way, Bill Lyons, are you here to look at this for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| or are you here related to the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Do you want to look over somebody's shoulder to see this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| It's going to be up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Can you see it on the screen up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| I was just wondering if you could see it on somebody's phone, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| It's going to be up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| I don't know that the screen is synchronizing with one of our phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| and this is kind of where the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3054)|
| 0:51:07| Victor, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| Okay for me to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| While you were hearing the other presentation, several of you were able to get connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| and you also pressed the blue present button on your app,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| because we're in roll call mode right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| and we now have six people present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| and if those of you who do not have apps in front of you could get around someone else who does have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| then you'll be able to watch the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| What you're looking at on the large screen in the room is what we call our public display,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| and this presents information that's there for public consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| for the commissioners to a certain extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| although some of this information is already displaying on your apps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| But it's primarily for the audience who may be present in chambers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| and may be watching online or may be watching on a recorded broadcast on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| so that there's a visual anchor of what's going on in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| This is sort of the dot on the map that says you are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| This is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| We're in roll call mode, which shows in the upper right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| and I'm just going to go on without those who aren't signed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| And by the way, what I'm running is Roll Call Pro, our voting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| which is the mothership in our product line that you connect to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| And the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of you who did this never have to do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| The app remembers what you've entered from session to session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| so all you do at the next meeting is launch the app, tap log in, and you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| So I'm going to tally the roll, and you can see that we have quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| Green is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| That's showing in the upper right-hand portion of the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Six present and five absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| And we'll go into the first item in our sample agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| And everything I do, by the way, would be at the direction of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| So when the chair says, okay, we'll now take up approval of agenda, I'll bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| And you'll see on the public display that we're now talking about approval of agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| but on the apps you're also told that we're in that agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| And you have buttons on your app that Commissioner Gill has already used to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| and we already have a second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Let's hold off on the amendments for a little while now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Let's not go into the deep end right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Would anybody like to speak to this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| If you would, you just press the request to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| By the way, all of these things that we're showing you right now are options you can turn on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| If you don't want to show the motions and seconds on the screen, you can turn that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| If you don't want to have the people in the request to speak queue numbered, you can turn that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| And, of course, Commissioner Nystrom, you can call on anybody in any order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| For example, if you decided to call on Commissioner Schoonmaker, you could do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| and I could do your bidding like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| But if you went in order and you recognized Commissioner Jay, by the way, somebody just left the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3265)|
| 0:54:33| I think it was Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| If you put yourself in the queue, you can take yourself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| If you hear somebody else say what you're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| But I'll just bring Commissioner Jay up to bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| We'll let him have his say, and then we'll go on to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| And seeing there are no other speakers to this issue, let's vote on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| So watch what happens on the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| This will display yes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Actually, in your case, I think it's nay or aye and no, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| I customized those buttons for you, so you can tap a button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| And once you voted, then you're shown how you voted, and you can change your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| So we're waiting for two people to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Now one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| So there are our results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| This item passed by a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| Commissioner Jay, did you have a question about the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| We've got to – Jack, if he can hear me, we've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| I just have a question about the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| What does the system accomplish that is a problem that we're facing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| I've not heard the pitch of why we would want this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| Well, let's let him get through the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Then when we get to a point where we want to debate the pros and cons of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| I think that would be an appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| One thing that we've done with this process is we have displayed a visual for the citizens to be able to consume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| because if they're just hearing activities, sometimes they can't even tell who's talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Secondly, what this is doing in the background is it's saving the results in two ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| so that the clerk or whomever is recording the minutes has something to work from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| It's also taking snapshots of these screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| And if you're – I'm going to skip an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| I'm going to skip approval of minutes, and I'm going to go on to public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| because sometimes you have citizens in the group and you want to time their speeches before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| You can set a timer at whatever value you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| You can have the background turn red at what we call an alert level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| or we can leave it running up at the top of the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| That's an option you have in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| So there's a function you can't see yet on my side that allows the clerk to be taking notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| typing the notes or typing the minutes as the meeting is proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| And if someone were to come in late, let's say that Commissioner Anderson were to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| you'd see them come in, and that would be time stamped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| So everything in the background is being time stamped so that you can figure out where discussions took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| when people came and went, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| I don't know if – do you use consent agendas in your work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Okay. I'm going to skip ahead to a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| And just for your benefit, the items that are in it are a routine electric department purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| a routine police department purchase, a routine wastewater department purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3466)|
| 0:57:54| and across the board, 15% raise retroactive to 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| Probably somebody would want to pull that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Okay. So I'm going to click a box on my screen, and I'm going to pull it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| and then we're going to go to staff raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| So that's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| So it's possible to put the whole agenda together ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| so you don't have to be doing a lot of editing in the course of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| and then skip around in the agenda, move around, maybe move items up, pull items, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| Okay. We have a motion on staff raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| By the way, this is what we call a summary screen, which you can display at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| If you've got lengthy wording or complicated wording of something, you can display it for everybody to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| The same way you can maximize the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| We have a motion by Gil and a second by Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| Do we have any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| Yeah, everybody wants a raise. Let's vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| The third, I don't know if you were listening, the first benefit of the system is a visual for everyone to see and absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| The second is to save information so that the clerk or recorder isn't having to write everything down in the course of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3549)|
| 0:59:19| And the other is that the votes take seconds rather than going around the room one by one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| and everybody knowing what positions the previous voters have taken on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| So this failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| There's another capability in the system, which I'm prepared to show you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| which gives the chairperson not only control of this discussion process, but it can also activate microphones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3578)|
| 0:59:48| as in activate the person that Commissioner Nystrom recognizes, turn off the previous speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| as well as move cameras if you like to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| I'm going to connect to it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| I'm going to show you the interface that the chair would see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| Let me display for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| I'm going to display my main monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Now you should see something with your images on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| Do you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3617)|
| 1:00:30| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Do you see a screen that has a sort of a softwood background and has Commissioner Nystrom at the bottom of a U?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| So this is a user interface to a program we called RTS Pro, which stands for Request to Speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3644)|
| 1:00:52| which would be located in front of the chair, not the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| And Commissioner Jay has just demonstrated what happens when one of you requests to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| Commissioner Nystrom can see that Commissioner Jay is first in line to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| Can we have a couple more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| Typically what members do is they get in line to speak, but sometimes they aren't recognized in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| If the chair wants to recognize them in order, he can click the green Next button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| which should bring up Commissioner Jay, and it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| But if he wants to recognize Commissioner Carringer out of order, you can just go tap that icon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| And you do this with a touchscreen interface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| So this offloads the whole structuring of discussion to the chair, and the clerk is just managing the voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3698)|
| 1:01:48| And the public display, by the way, if I change back to Roll Call Pro, this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| the actions that the chair might take on this other display are echoed for everyone to be able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| on the Roll Call Pro public screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| So we have a motion on the traffic presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| We don't really need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| I'm going to go back to Roll Call Pro and I'm going to clear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| With your permission, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| Hearing no opposition, I'm going to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| We have two people in line to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Do you have comments to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| So you might be asking questions of the person who made a traffic presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3760)|
| 1:02:53| I'm going to move to a new item, approval of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| I just wanted to go back to a different kind of a voting item and stop here for a second and make one comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| and then ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| We have over 20 counties in Tennessee that are using this voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| A lot of them meet on Monday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| So they would have used it last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| But there are also several cities and a couple of school boards that use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| Typically there are groups larger than five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| And you'd certainly qualify in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| And like I said, there are three reasons why people typically pick this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| One is to create documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| Another is to create a public view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| And the third is to speed up the process of roll call voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| I'm going to turn to Commissioner Busler, whom I bumped into at TCSA in Gattenberg last November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3821)|
| 1:03:54| and ask what were the reasons that you asked me to make this presentation to this group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| And what benefits do you think it provides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| To go with the rest of the commissioners here, the big thing is you see your votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3847)|
| 1:04:16| The public sees our votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Instead of, you know, you call all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| I'll say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| We each have to show our votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Instead of just by voice, they understand who's voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| The other thing that he showed on here too is if we have to go back and review something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| you have a screen that you slide over for, you know, what time it was spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| when it was spoke to, and which was the way it was recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| Could you show that screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| Yeah, you're talking about the text results file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Let me move that over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| This is what we've been creating just in the process of your working this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| We took a roll call and here are the people present and absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| We worked on the approval of agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| That started at 4.53 and 17 seconds my time, motioned by Gil, seconded by Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| We recognized Schoonmaker and Jay, and then we voted at 4.54, almost 4.55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| and it passed by majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| And here are the positions, the ayes, the noes, the abstains, and the absents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| And that's the sort of thing that's being kept for you automatically in the background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| and the clerk or whomever is recording the minutes can refer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| The other thing that it's doing in the background is it's producing a JPEG, a snapshot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3934)|
| 1:05:42| and if you'll pardon my slow computer, I'll wait for this JPEG to display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| and then I'll slide it over and you'll see a record of how the vote turned out on staff raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| that you might print out and hand to a reporter or someone may ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| hey, how did that last vote turn out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| You can show them this display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| So all this is being kept for you automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Is that what you were looking for, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Yes, and also tell how portable this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| If we have sub-meetings and other meetings that needs to be recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| how this can be very easily put into those rooms where they're speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| where we have a railroad committee or we have a transportation committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| or we have an audit committee where all this can be worked out and shown what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3986)|
| 1:06:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| In Williamson County they used it with four different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Basically what you do is you'd implement it on a laptop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| so that this laptop could travel around from room to room if that were needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| and you'd simply create a roster, which is a list of names and login IDs and passwords,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| for each of the different groups to identify who's the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| It looks like I slid Commissioner Gill to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Sorry about that, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| And you would go through and customize the rules on how you want to display votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| whether you want to use motions and seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| or whether you want to use our discussion management system with some sort of public timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| Each group could put together their own agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| and any number of groups could meet using this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| Oh, I just realized I'm showing you the wrong screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| I need to show you this screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| I was showing you that on the roster you simply go in and create a roster for each group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4050)|
| 1:07:38| You see a list of names here, you see login IDs and passwords you used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| who's the chair, whose icons you want to show and request to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| You set these things up and you customize these rules and save them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| and then you can use it for any number of legislative groups or committees or boards as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4071)|
| 1:08:00| They just have to have a smart device like a phone or a tablet or a Windows 10 client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| a laptop or a Surface Pro to be able to download the free app that you've downloaded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| and use it to participate in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| Is there anything else related to this presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| No, I've gone through my agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| I just wanted to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| I'll see if we have any quick questions, and then we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| This is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| What you may want to do, you can follow it up with the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| I'd be curious to get a list of all the counties and municipalities in Tennessee that use the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| Don't list them now, but sending them as a follow-up would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| The chair recognizes Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| Who would be running this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| Is this the clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| Whomever you designate to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| Is it traditionally the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| The reason why I qualify that answer is that in lots of places where we work around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| it's the clerk or the deputy clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| but there are also places where there's a person designated to support the commission or the board who's not the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4158)|
| 1:09:26| That's the case, for example, in Williamson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| The mayor's office runs everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| Has a Knox County clerk been included in this discussion or presentation in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4173)|
| 1:09:42| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Is that a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Yeah, other than being part of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Is this only app-driven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Because I've got it on the desktop, but obviously I can't log in on the desktop, and I feel like I'm somewhat tech-savvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| So, Zach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| It's my understanding you mentioned that there was a Windows 10 app as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| You can go to RollCallSystems.com in the Downloads page and download it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| and participate just the way these other people are using apps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| I went to that, and it was basically just a sales page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| It looked like six different things on the front of it, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Do you mind emailing out those links so we can check this out at a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| Does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| The Downloads page has four icons on it for different programs, and you just need the Windows 10 client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| I'm not seeing any other lights regarding questions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| I know this is a – when Commissioner Bussler brought this to us in December, we agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| let's take a look at it, and this is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I'm sure there will be some extra visits and follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| I also communicated to the City of Knoxville office, as well as the PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| that this is something that we'll be getting a presentation on tonight, just if they wanted to take a look at it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| I think that's got our questions covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I know we've got a big agenda tonight, so it would probably be best to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Seeing no other lights on this, thank you, Commissioner Bussler, for bringing it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| Thank you, Victor, for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| Madam Clerk, what's the next item on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Item number six, which is we're going to be recognizing some folks who are recently recognized by the Tennessee Hospitality and Tourism Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| I think the proper motion would be to send that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| To move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| I also want to thank Commissioner Skinmaker and Daly for bringing that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Was that you, Carson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Is that something we all may want to sign on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| It looks like I know a bunch of these folks, and they seem to be from all over our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| So, would all the commission want to sign on as sponsors of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| And I also want to particularly thank Carson and John for bringing it to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| These are some pretty big deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Are they all going to be here at the meeting next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| They're planning on it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| And we've got a terrific tourism association here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| So, do I have a motion to send forward with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Motion from Commissioner Gill, and is that a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| That was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| That was your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| So, John made it, and Commissioner Gill is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| So, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| It's number eight, Resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| It's approving an agreement with the Lewis Group Architects Incorporated, P.C., in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| amount of $1,085,000 plus reimbursable expenses for the design of a new northwest elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Can I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| I'd have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders, with a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| And, Russ, if you could please approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| When this came up, I thought this created, as I said on the form, a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| just to kind of get an update on where we were on this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| If there are questions about the details of the contract, Doug Dillingham can speak directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| An update where we are in the process is we're in the process of acquiring property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| And as you go back and you look at our capital plan approved by the board last year, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4407)|
| 1:13:35| within that a concept zone for this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| It basically runs between Hardin Valley Elementary School and Carnes Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| We've been looking for 20 plus acres of property, contiguous acres in one parcel in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| for the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| We have found some suitable property that the owners are not interested in selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| We found some suitable property that were bought by other entities before we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| We're currently in the process of evaluating 60 acres of property that's really sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4446)|
| 1:14:15| the last resort that we've come to in what I call the concept zone for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| We have some concerns about the geology on that piece of property and the sinkholes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| may be present on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| So we're waiting on an engineering report on that before we can determine if it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| suitable piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| If not, I think we'll probably have to expand our search and have some discussions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| the Board of Education about do we adjust our concept zone for that school and do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| go to another area to look for property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| Thank you, Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Are there any questions for my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| How much preliminary design can you do until you have the actual piece of property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| understand the topo and all that that could play into the design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| I know when we were looking at Hardin Valley Middle School, we ideally wanted to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| the same school we were building at Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| We went from a one-story structure to a two-story structure because of land use restraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| I'm going to let Doug talk to that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| Doug Dillingham, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Commissioner Smith, there's not a lot that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| We can start going through program standards and familiarizing the architectural firm with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| We can put together a few concepts, but anything that we have is going to have to be adapted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| to the piece of property once it's procured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| There's not a whole lot, but there is a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| Okay, so we approve the contract, but we don't do a lot of work on it until we actually get our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| piece of property and know our restraints that we have to design around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| We'll actually use their expertise as well in trying to determine a suitable piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| We'll make use of them as much as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| How many acres are you looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| Typically for an elementary school, we're looking for 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| We can use less than that depending on the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Sorry, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| My question is probably for Russ Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| If we, the concept zone, could you speak just briefly to the capacity of those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| Because we continue to expand in schools without seeking a longer-term capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| so capacity of 400 students, 600 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| We're looking at initially building this school for 900-plus students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| That's what I wanted to know because you're talking about in between Carnes and the Hardin Valley community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| so roughly about 900 students to be pulled from those schools or just growth in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| Not initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| We wouldn't want to fill the school the day we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| But we're looking at building some excess capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| And then, you know, as we have, as has been our practice for the last several years when we build a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| particularly a suburban school, we try to look at building it so that we can come back and add on later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| So we designed the addition more or less as we're putting up the original building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Yeah, back to you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| We're looking to relieve pressure in the Carnes Elementary and Hardin Valley Elementary, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| And this ball camp also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| Depending on the location of the piece of property we get, it could affect some of the other schools contiguous to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| but it would be just incrementally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| If we have enough, do we have enough growth right now to fill this new third school in that triangle area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4690)|
| 1:18:17| Well, we don't want to fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| We would prefer to grow into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| Do we need to be looking for a site to also, if elementary is growing, that would in turn mean eventually middle school would be growing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| Do we need to be looking for another site to locate two schools on eventually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| We haven't looked in detail at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| I think that we are probably ‑‑ I can tell you right now that we have excess middle school capacity around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| Where we have the excess capacity is not where we need the excess capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| So you could get to, you could fix that problem without construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| but you would have to really uproot 70 or 80 percent of the communities in the county to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4737)|
| 1:19:05| That's not something that we have a great desire to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| Thank you, Commissioner Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| Any other questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| All in favor of that motion before us, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| Item number 22, resolution 411, is approving a professional services agreement with Barge Design Solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| Incorporated in an amount not to exceed $250,000 for the South Peters Road, Ebenezer Road, ADA sidewalk compliance project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4775)|
| 1:19:46| Can I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| Jim, if you could step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| I know it seems like we've been getting a lot of communication around sidewalks in general with that ordinance update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| those before us this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| So I pulled those items just, I guess, to frankly give you a chance to talk to some of these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| I know they're not directly related, but I thought that it, coincidentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| it looked like a good time to kind of give you an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Yeah, and that's why actually one of these is less than the threshold that would necessarily need to come before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| but we wanted to kind of get you all in the loop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| This is, after the transition plan was completed, this is the first two projects that we've undertook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4822)|
| 1:20:30| that is a direct result of the ADA transition plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| What we've tried to do, because we have essentially $45 million in public right-of-way ADA liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| we want to be very strategic in where we spend that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| So what we did is we sat down with the ADA folks and kind of decided that these roads, Ebenezer and Peters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| were probably the most pressing needs because of the ADT that they carry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| the pedestrian traffic that they carry, and the nearby proximity to commercial and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| So based on that, these are the two locations that we felt like were the highest priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| and that we wanted to spend the first pot of money that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| The Cedar Bluff is a little over 7 miles, or pardon me, the Ebenezer-Peters is a little over 7 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| and the Cedar Bluff is about 2 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| So we want to essentially go in there and adjust driveways and cross slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| to create an ADA-safe path throughout the whole corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| So that's kind of what we're doing, just starting that transition plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| and knotting that apple one piece at a time with these two as a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| Any other? Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| So these, where would our focus, do we have a strategic capital improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| in what part of town after we do these two are we moving to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| Do we have a list of the areas that are high priority that the county needs to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| We do. It's not, it's probably a list of about 10 locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| But we do have others that will, as soon as we get these out of the pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| you'll see more come into that and it will essentially be occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| until we get all those deficiencies corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Where is it actually going to start on the Ebenezer Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| It goes all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| It starts at North Shore Drive and goes all the way, actually across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| if you want to consider it, even to Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| and then jumps up to Sherrill Boulevard at the county limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| and continues on up to Middlebrook as well as this section of Old Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| There's some deficiencies along that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| So that whole corridor, we'll see new sidewalks where needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Commissioner Dale, if you don't mind, I'm going to ask a quick question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| and then I'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| One's an observation and then this is a non-engineer question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| What exactly are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| You mentioned that you've got some smoothing of driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Is this an area where there's existing sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Are we just going in and trying to flatten it out to make it smoother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| So if you could kind of say exactly what does this mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| And then my observation, which you may want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| is that both of these are areas that we've actually installed pedestrian islands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| because we've identified them previously as high traffic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| I know we've had a lot of conversations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| But I guess does that also kind of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| the data that supported the pedestrian islands in both of these hot spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| that's probably the same data that has supported these being the first spots for this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| It sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| It's probably the most used pedestrian facilities we have in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| And you're exactly right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| What ADA requires is less than a 2% cross slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| So essentially what we have out there is where the sidewalk is either settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| or maybe a utility went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| There's various reasons why that cross slope may be steeper than what it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| And if someone has limited mobility, that creates an issue for them traversing that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| A lot of the handicapped ramps out there, that section of roadway was built 25 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5056)|
| 1:24:22| Those ramp standards have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| So we need to correct those to where they're up to a current standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| So the majority of it is cross slope related and then intersection related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| where those ramps need to be modified to meet the current standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| Jim, is this part of the $40 million to $80 million project in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| that we approved what, a million dollars a year towards these projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| Yes, sir, that was roughly the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| And we don't have an exact amount of construction cost estimates on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| but these projects both will be several hundred thousand dollars each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| And so we will have a little bit more money to do another project to meet these standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| There's other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| In addition to the public right-of-way, there are buildings and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| that Cindy and ADA also has to prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| So we're only one part of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| And for the public who may be watching at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| what they're referencing is that we recently, as a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| completed an inventory led by Cindy Bianchi of all of the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| that we needed to bring up to speed over the next 20 years to meet ADA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| And it's millions of dollars of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| And as Commissioner Daley had just referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| we are budgeting a million or so a year to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| and start chewing down on these particular projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| And these are the first example of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| We do have a proper motion before us on Item 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| All in favor of that item, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| I'll go ahead and call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| These were linked together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| But Item 23 is the next item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| It's similar to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| If I could get a motion for approval on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| All right, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| And I think Commissioner Anders may have beat you to the punch on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| All in favor of that motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| All right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| Item number 30, Resolution 701,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| is adopting the Knox County Greenway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| which recommends approximately 65 miles of greenway alignment along the following corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| Beaver Creek, North Shore Drive, and portions of John Sevier and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| I think I recognized Commissioner Jay with the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| and the second was that you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| And discussion, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| Yeah, I would like to send no recommendation because I would like to look through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| and I may have questions next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| And with no recommendation, we can approve it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| I mean, I'll approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| I'll vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| But I would still like to look at the gentleman brought up in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| It wasn't on the list that I've seen out at Bonnie Kate, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Well, the proper thing would be that would be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| I'd like to make a substitute motion to send with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| We have a substitute motion on the floor from Commissioner Daley to send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| It was seconded, I believe, by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Is there any additional discussion tonight, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| And this can move to Monday as well in terms of where the fiscal note will be coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5257)|
| 1:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| No, I'm just talking about for the entire project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| For the entire project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| For the entire project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| We'll be voting strictly on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| And getting the work done is a different deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5283)|

| 1:34:49| Before round eight, let's have some discussion on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| And I was counting the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| I'm not sure, Commissioner Henders, if you or Commissioner Daly's light came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| I'll recognize Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| He made the first motion, actually, for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| So I'll recognize you for discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5708)|
| 1:35:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| You appreciate you answering the questions that I had on the e-mails and very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| Still got a concern on Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| I think the public needs to know what Plan B is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| So would you explain to us what Plan B would be if in case the Attorney General comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| with a judgment that, yes, the schools have custody control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| Plan B is simply any department in this building that reports to the mayor could move to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5748)|
| 1:35:56| east tower and floors one through six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| That could also include some offices at Central that also report to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| And then that frees up space in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| And also, I've had a discussion today with a couple of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| and the concern come up that we're splitting government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| You know, let's say that we move all the mayor's office there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| and we do not move the law department or we do not move trustee or which conversation goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5788)|
| 1:36:37| I'm not saying daily, but I'm sure that there are conversations going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| and we're looking at, what, a half a mile away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| No, no, you're about, what, six blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| I mean, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Well, we've got a map coming up here pretty soon on the sidewalk study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| that shows it being anywhere from around 3H to a half a mile or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| Ultimately, today in the year 2020, most of our communication happens electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5818)|
| 1:37:06| Hey, Chris, a few folks are having a hard time hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| I think today, and it is 2020, so I do think that we do have a lot of communication electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5830)|
| 1:37:19| I know IT does a lot of Skyping, so I don't think face-to-face meetings is a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5839)|
| 1:37:28| You know, I don't think the trustee needs to move from this building up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| I think you want to keep it where city tax is, so you have the same place to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| so we would never look to move trustee there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| And so I don't see any inconvenience of having any department underneath the mayor up there rather than here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5865)|
| 1:37:56| One of my questions was or is in three years, seven years, we'll have a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| Well, is this going to tie the hands of the new administration how they want to do business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| This is a big move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| This is a huge move, and this is something that's going to be—I've lost a lot of sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5892)|
| 1:38:21| Some of my e-mails will say that it's 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| and this is a big, huge decision that we've got to make that it's not going to affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| not only this administration or this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| It's going to affect 10, 15, 20 years down the road, and that's what I'm looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| and that's some of my questions were, you know, what happens if TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| so what happens if TVA wants to go to Chattanooga?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| What happens if—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| TVA is not going to Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| I'm not saying they are, but it's—they've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| No, they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Yes, they have, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| They have talked about it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| I sent you an e-mail today where they said they were going to knock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| I know you have, but in the past, Chris, they have talked about moving to Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| I think people have talked about it, but they said today that was not in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| That's fine, and I said I appreciate your answer from the e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| and there is an e-mail that everyone should have got, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| You all got that e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| So I think ultimately how it impacts mayors moving forward in 3 or 7 years or 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5955)|
| 1:39:24| is by doing this contract, then it gives them more money to spend in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5964)|
| 1:39:31| This money saves tax dollars for taxpayers and for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| and it's not going to limit access for people to go to the East Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5976)|
| 1:39:43| We prefer option one, which is moving the school administration up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| That is our goal, but this is too good of a deal to let this pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| if it's not schools and it has to be county administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| I understand when you say that you don't think that you're limiting access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| I mean, right now you don't have to use a federal ID to come into this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| Up there you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| What about large groups that want to come up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| If all of them don't have federal IDs, they're not going to be able to enter into that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| Another concern is that if we, and I'm for consolidating and selling the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| not central property or any other property that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| But also a concern is that I don't want to make it harder for the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| who already think that it's hard to come to this building anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| We've got e-mails from people complaining about having to come to this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| the parking and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| We just don't want to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| I've got a concern about the veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| What are we going to do to the Veterans Administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| We've said over and over that veterans would not be going to the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| I told you that Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Veterans are not going to the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| We've talked about Summer Place with an attached garage where there's direct access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| We're looking at other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| They're not going to the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| There are plans for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6075)|
| 1:41:24| Whether it's school administration or general accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| if you're a citizen and you go to the A.J. building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| you have to have a Tennessee driver's license to get upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| If you come to this building, you have to go through screening to get in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| We're combining those up there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| It's combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| You show an I.D. and you go through security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| Now, October 1st, if the feds do put in place a real I.D.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| there's no guarantee that's going to happen, but if that did happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| and you do not have a real I.D., you get scanned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| and we bring whoever you're meeting with down to meet with you on the plaza left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| You still have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| You're just not going up in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| You're not being deterred of any service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| It's just because you do not have a real I.D., if that goes into effect October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| you can't go up in the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6149)|
| 1:42:37| I'm still concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| I look at it and I see your numbers, and the numbers look good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| and the statements have been made many, many times that it's too good to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| Usually when that statement is it's too good to be true, it usually is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| but these are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| The numbers are good numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| My holdup and my concern is still the future 10 years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| 15 years down the road, 20 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| What's going to happen when we split our government into what's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| to this city county building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Is schools going to move in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| What's it going to cost to renovate if the schools come in at the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| which is part of Plan B, if it don't work properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| That's part of Plan B if it don't work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| I do have some concerns, and I'm going to lose sleep tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| and I'm going to lose sleep tomorrow night, and the next night, and the next night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| I'll be glad when this vote comes so we can go ahead and do the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| I'm still concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| I don't know if the Easttown Mall situation is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| I've not heard any more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| If that option is still, I still would like to see what that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| We did approve a study to look at a study of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| and I don't think we've seen anything about that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| And I'm not sitting here telling you that the Easttown is the place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| I would just like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| I am going to vote what the citizens has told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| not what government officials has asked me to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| what the citizens has asked me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| We do appreciate your due diligence, questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| and the capacity to respond to the constituents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| My question is procedural because with the absence of one commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| we have no recommendation which is the best decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| But we have 40-plus documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| Is the procedural aspect all one resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| or is it each individual documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| Because the resolution as it's written is not all of the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| It's just the authorizing resolution for the actual transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| and I just need some assistance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| I'm going to restate your question, Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| just to make sure that whoever responds to it responds correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| It sounded like your question was we've gotten some of the final documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| on the transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| I know we've gotten some hard copies and Attorney Mametoff sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| Is your question do we need to vote on each document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| or is your question more when a vote comes to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| if it's next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| the resolution before us is to enter into contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| Is your question kind of saying do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| or should we be able to vote on each contract individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| I just need to clarify for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| Is the resolution authorizing all the contracts that are present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| which are plus 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| So when we vote Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| that one resolution authorizes all the contractual language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| under the 40 supporting documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| It's my understanding that it is because I'm looking at one resolution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| I can even look to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| I think all those contracts are tied in underneath that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| Well, I think, and we're still fluid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| we've got a phone call this morning that they were going to prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| a different resolution, and I'm not sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| I'll know, I mean, I hate to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| You're voting without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| I'll know something more in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| We have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| So right now this resolution, as I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| takes care of the three major easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| But I think Mark was working on a resolution that may do what Chris is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| implying, but I don't know the answer to that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| We still have some assignments of subagreements that's in this pile, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| In the end, we will have to have a vote that ratifies all these contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| because it's real property by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| However you want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| but we have to make sure that everything's included in your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| Truthfully, I'll just know more in the morning once we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| to sit down and talk about what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| Chris, can you comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| By the way, the Chair recognizes Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| but there was a pending question right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| So, John, I'll get to you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| The one that's in question would be the sublease to us for DCM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| which is Digital Crossing Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| There is some indemnity language in there that TVA is working to take out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6477)|
| 1:48:05| and we've asked them to take that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| and so they're working through that with DCM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| So what you may see is a caveat in there that's concurrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| on them getting that removed, and that goes into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| But they have been working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| They just don't know if it's going to be finalized this week or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Mr. Caldwell, Chairman Nystrom does a good job of trying to tell the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| who is watching on TV exactly what's going on during the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| and you referenced under Plan B that it would be the mayor's departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| Could you spell out which departments potentially would go to the TVA tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| Because I'd also like to write them down because I've got citizens asking me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| questions just like Commissioner Daley is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| Well, you would potentially have the finance department, community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6535)|
| 1:49:03| potentially procurement, IT, HR, risk management, benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6543)|
| 1:49:19| A quick clarification question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| You mentioned procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| Is procurement over at the Sears building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| And that goes along in with Phase 2, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| So Phase 2 would be to dispose of Knox Central, also known as the Sears building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6569)|
| 1:49:39| and get it back in private hands and back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| And then that could also include something done with rural high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| You could also see a consolidation of school maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| And so all those things are on the table in Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| Phase 1 that we were focused on is getting out of the AJ building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| and occupying East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| Follow-up, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| So as chairman of commission, would you make the decision whether the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| would stay in this building or transfer to the TVA tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6612)|
| 1:50:20| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| Frankly, I have not talked to Mr. Caldwell about that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| I would guess I haven't even talked to Mr. Caldwell about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| You'd have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| You don't have an assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| I would think we would stay here because this room is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| So just kind of a common sense one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| I figure we'd stay here because this is where we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| So all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| John, is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Commissioner Carringer, then Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| Yeah, so thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| I wanted to ask Chris, so are we saying that we would put Knox Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| the old Sears building, up for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| We would move everybody out of there to TVA East Tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| I'm saying eventually, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| Phase two, our plan in phase two is to dispose of Knox Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6669)|
| 1:51:18| and relocate those services or those departments either in East Tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6678)|
| 1:51:26| or Summer Place or in another location that's suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| So if we're talking about Summer Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| that's something that we have not discussed except all the parking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| But in terms of offices being in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| there is a lot, a lot of renovation that would have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| I mean, I have asthma, and I came out sick for a week after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| because of the mold and mildew and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| So we haven't even begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| Do we have any kind of estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| Ultimately, what we're talking about when we're talking about Summer Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| is you could move Schools Warehouse from the second floor of Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6725)|
| 1:52:11| over to Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| That's not going to take any time for remodeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| So we're not talking about moving humans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| No, you can take Knox Records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| and move it from downstairs in Central over to Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| And so that does not require any renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| We're not really planning on moving office space per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| So we're not really planning on moving people into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| No, and our plan two would be we would get funds from the sale of Knox Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6756)|
| 1:52:45| That could be used to do anything that we would need to do office-wise to Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| Okay, so we're looking way down the road then on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| Okay, so then the question would be if the schools choose to not or vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| school board votes to not move the schools over to TVA East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| then we move Mayor's Office and HR and all the offices that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| is that going to be enough offices moving out of this building to accommodate the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6793)|
| 1:53:21| Well, ultimately in plan B, right, so schools would have to agree to said move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6801)|
| 1:53:30| So I will tell you the reason we like plan A so good is because we get to stay here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6810)|
| 1:53:39| and you don't have any type of renovation expense by moving schools from there to here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6819)|
| 1:53:45| You just move schools from A.J. over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| So there's no doubt that with plan B there's added expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| and so we would have to work through that and we would sit down with school officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| to go through wants and needs and programming once again and see how that process plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6836)|
| 1:54:06| All right, I'm going to go back to Commissioner Busler, then back to Daley, and then back to Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6846)|
| 1:54:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| When you started talking about moving Central out there to go into the Summer Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6855)|
| 1:54:22| Summer Place when I visited some time ago was kind of musty and a little bit damp and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| The schools keep a lot of paper goods and things out at the store Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| even though it's not climatized really out there, they keep that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| So you'd be moving paper goods into an area that's probably a little bit damp in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| and it also has some standing water that you have from the parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| that also infiltrates that building a little bit, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| I think in the building space there was no evidence of water, which is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| Well, neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| I was there and saw some evidence of some kind of mold and mildew in that plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| But they also have a printing shop there at Door Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| Where would that go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| A printing shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| Up there on the top floor they have a place where they do printing and some other stuff up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| or some printing machines up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| So we would work with school officials on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| I don't know what is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Laid forward, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| I don't know what is printed up in the second level of Central, but I'm sure that could be moved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6925)|
| 1:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| The other issue is you mentioned earlier on that you were trying to work with a University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6935)|
| 1:55:43| for renting the top six floors, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| Do you have a written document or agreement with them that you are working with them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| I'm going to refer to a week ago as we had a conversation with UT here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| and they got up here and said to this commission that they were fine with the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| that were in front of them and was ready to sign once we got through our hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| So I don't have any issues telling you that UT is ready to sign the documents just like we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6966)|
| 1:56:13| but as a sub-easement to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| Sub-easement to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| Taking all liability just like what we're doing on those top six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| Taking liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| I think ultimately they're going to sub-lease from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| They're self-insured just like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6992)|
| 1:56:38| I think I would ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| You want to find reasons not to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| Do you know how many liability claims have been filed in the AJ building since we've been in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7004)|
| 1:56:51| That's not workers' comp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to look at a document, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| that we're going to be taking the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| and taking them out of seven election cycles to where if they wanted to have something changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7029)|
| 1:57:18| it would be seven election cycles before we would have an opportunity for those new elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7038)|
| 1:57:26| to weigh in their ideas from the public on the use of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7046)|
| 1:57:32| Fifteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| That's seven election cycles that you're asking the public to give up their opportunity to give their ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| if something goes wrong or awry down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| The next question I've got is these documents that we've got before us, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| are they all fulfilled and to where we will be able to vote on them next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7070)|
| 1:58:00| According to Mark, the issues that are remaining are what you might say de minimis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7080)|
| 1:58:09| But there are some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| I think Chris mentioned one with the digital company that has an indemnification in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| They're trying to work out and get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| We have an easement that we haven't even negotiated with yet that could affect the completion of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| There are still some loose ends out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| So I'll know more about each of the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| What I'm trying to say is in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| And we may have something more final for you to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| I think you're making the motion without recommendation by next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| But right now, all of them are still fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| So in that case, I have no more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| So let's just vote on safe Senate without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| We can discuss it more then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| I'm going to Commissioner Anders because the other two commissioners had already weighed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| Yeah, I think we spent a lot of time last week having these conversations, these varied conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7149)|
| 1:59:16| And everything that we do up here affects the next, you know, we placed three schools this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7156)|
| 1:59:24| That affects how funding goes for the next administration's own schools and the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| We signed a contract to do a senior center with Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| That wasn't an election term cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| That was for the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| Everything we do that has substance is long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| So I don't know, you know, we're putting a million dollars more in the mental health of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| We're saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| UT is paying us more than we're paying TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| And in the long term, I think what you've got to do is what are the cost savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| and functionally what is best for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| You know, even if the mayor's office moved to the TVA towers and the school system wanted to stay in the AJ building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7202)|
| 2:00:08| which I think is, I mean, I hope that they move over to the TVA towers if we sign this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7208)|
| 2:00:15| But everything we do that lays brick and mortar is long term planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| takes long term planning out of the hands of the next administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| So I think that's a very invalid excuse to not vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| This is a, I had my hesitations at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| All those were worked out with the parking garage and access to, you know, for people to be able to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7232)|
| 2:00:39| It's easier to park at Summer Place and go to TVA Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| than it is to park at Dwight Kessel and go to either of these two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| And so the arguments are for those, I think, that just don't want to vote for it and are looking for a reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7247)|
| 2:00:55| But I think everything that we do has substance last beyond your election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| And I think it's foolish for us to stop to think just in an election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| Those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Back to Commissioner Daley, then Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| Chris, we talked Friday about the opinion from the AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| Has anything progressed since Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| So that's part of the meeting with the law director in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| And then after that we are prepared to file the AG opinion and get that rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7284)|
| 2:01:31| And do we expect that to be 45 days, 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| Do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| We will ask, and we have already spoken to the AG about expediting that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| And so we think we can get it back maybe by mid-February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| But you're always on their schedule, so we will see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| Back to Summer Place and the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| Just to kind of run through the numbers again, 700 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| TVA is going to rent how many from us for their employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| So where are they all parking now then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| They park in Walnut Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| So that's how that works then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| And UT wanted like 300 spaces, and we wanted about 300 spaces or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| Those will need 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| UT would like 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| And we've got 50 left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| UT Police parks in the lot next to Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| That's where they're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| They're in a free lot now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| Sorry, TVA, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| And then just to kind of follow up on Commissioner Daley's conversation just a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| last week I was in a meeting in Nashville with the State Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| And it was a 30-minute meeting, and about 10 minutes of it we discussed how an attorney general receives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7371)|
| 2:03:00| and answers an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| And he made it very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| And, of course, obviously Knox County has not done anything at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| but he made it very clear that it was the responsibility of his office to give opinions to the Governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7390)|
| 2:03:17| the Secretary of the State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the General Assembly, and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7397)|
| 2:03:24| and that it's not the duty of his office to make local decisions for counties and cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7404)|
| 2:03:31| So, and he's aware of what's going on here in Knox County because, obviously, he's from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| He did say that it's their, basically, obligation is once they have a request for an opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7418)|
| 2:03:47| the answer will be given in 45 days unless it's kicked back because it's not relevant to something that they would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7427)|
| 2:03:55| And, of course, he stressed again that, you know, they'll do things for the senators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7435)|
| 2:04:02| and the representatives of the state, but that's their responsibility to do issues for the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| and not things for the county, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| And we're following this on behalf, we, this will be followed on behalf of one of our state senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7449)|
| 2:04:17| Which, who would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| Would be Senator Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| I'd just like to add some final comments before we, I think we're wrapping it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| and we're moving on to passing it forward to next week, which is, I'm sure, going to have more debate and more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| But just to my fellow commissioners, this should not be the biggest issue that we have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7483)|
| 2:04:50| You should not lose sleep over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| We're talking about moving administrative offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| We've got a lot of problems in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| We've got big problems that require big decisions that require real money and real leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| And moving some administrative offices should not be the highest, you know, priority in this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| If this was based upon facts, if this was based upon math, if this was based upon data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| we've been done with this a long time ago, but it's really become a political fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| If you don't like it because you don't like it, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| but it seems like every single time the goalposts are set of we have this problem or this problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7521)|
| 2:05:28| and those are accomplished or solved, it's but we have this problem too, but we have this problem too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| but we have this problem, I mean, it's endless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| And I just, I really want to encourage everybody to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| This is a real opportunity for us to save millions and millions of dollars of our citizens' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| an opportunity to make a really logical decision where we can have greater impact on our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7546)|
| 2:05:54| we can have greater impact on the use of those taxes, all of our capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| There are so many things that we could be doing that will make much bigger impact to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| And, you know, last week we had, I edited it up, it was something like over 120 hours of professional experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7563)|
| 2:06:11| that came up one after one after one that said, listen to the data, listen to the professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| and listen to our ability to explain to you that you have a great opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| Don't waste it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| I feel like this body is so risk adverse that likely we'll talk ourselves out of every single thing and never do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| That's not what Knox County is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| Knox County is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| Knox County is prospering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| There are so many people and businesses and opportunities ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| Don't let this be the thing that we missed an opportunity on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| Take a look at the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| Take a look at the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| Take a look at the answers and realize we have a really strong group of professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| that are trying to make a solid decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| And I really think that if we can look 20 or 30 or 40 years down the road in a positive way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7612)|
| 2:06:59| we'll see that we have a real opportunity to move the needle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| And I just would really encourage everybody to take a step back and think about why you maybe like or don't like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| and then really think about can you justify the next time a budget cycle comes up to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7628)|
| 2:07:14| sorry, we don't have the money when we had an opportunity to save millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| and really invest that in the long-term future of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| So thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| The motion before us is to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| For those of you watching at home, that just means that it will not be put on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| That means it will be voted on officially next week at the Board of Commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7661)|

| 2:07:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| It will be on the agenda for next week for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| Item number 38, Resolution 903, is regarding approval of the payment in lieu of tax pilot transaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7672)|

| 2:08:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| The proper motion on this one, my fellow Commissioners, will be to send forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| as it will require a roll call vote at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7714)|

| 2:08:48| Or if we can move any discussion or the actual vote to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| I'm looking to you, Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7732)|

| 2:09:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| Bill Lyons, 400 Main Street, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| We have this pilot is before you is one that City Council has approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| It's actually quite a while ago, and the project has been added to a little bit, hence it went back to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7751)|
| 2:09:18| and now to this body for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| It's been through the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| It's a key project in the key area that will, we think, lead to a lot more investment and future tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7763)|
| 2:09:31| and we strongly support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| And the applicant, Mr. Nash, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Are there any particular questions about the development itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| Jeffrey, would you like to come forward and just give us kind of an update on what the project is going to look like when we're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7778)|
| 2:09:46| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| Jeffrey Nash, the Cortland Group, 109 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| Mr. Nash, while you've got the floor here, kind of tell us what you're doing with the property briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7793)|
| 2:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| The property comprises currently of an existing small building that's very, very old and very, very beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| and quite an amount of land that we have acquired along the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| The latest hold-up was due to an acquisition that we were making from TDOT in order to put everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7813)|
| 2:10:22| We've now acquired the closed part of Lamar Street, which was closed some 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7822)|
| 2:10:30| The land and the building I referred to has actually been vacant for the last – well, I've watched it vacant for the last 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7830)|
| 2:10:39| It's had three or four owners during that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| What we intend to do is totally refurbish the existing building, turn the corner lot, if any of you are aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7842)|
| 2:10:50| the corner lot, which was historically used as a parking lot to support the existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| that is going to be turned into a landscaped courtyard supporting the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7856)|
| 2:11:03| The land at the back that we've acquired now and the additional land that we've acquired from Lamar Street and from TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7863)|
| 2:11:13| is going to be basically used as a parking lot supporting a new building, which will have 20 apartments in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7873)|
| 2:11:23| and street-level commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| The existing building that I referred to earlier will have commercial space at the lower level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| and four apartments above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| In summary, the entire project will comprise of 24 apartments, a plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7896)|
| 2:11:45| but there is going to be a 20-foot plaza between the existing building and the new build that we'll be putting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7905)|
| 2:11:56| So there will be 24 apartments plus about 8,500 square foot of commercial space on the street level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7916)|
| 2:12:06| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7926)|
| 2:12:07| Any commissioners have a question for Mr. Nash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| That motion is properly before us to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| Does he have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| Are you one building away from the intersection where the AAA office is, or is that that actual building on 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7940)|
| 2:12:28| No, we are one building away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| We're the opposite side of Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| Right across from Senior Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| Item 39 is O-20-1-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| It's amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, zoning article 2, definitions 4, I'm sorry, definitions article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7976)|
| 2:13:04| supplementary regulations to add a new section 4.106 standards for the use and review approval of vehicle repair service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7984)|
| 2:13:12| in the CN Neighborhood Commercial District, and article 5, zone regulations to identify automobile repair service shops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7992)|
| 2:13:19| as a use and review in the CN Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| This amends ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10th, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8002)|
| 2:13:30| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| Mr. Chairman, if there's nobody here to speak on this item, I'd like to make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8012)|
| 2:13:37| It's an ordinance anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| I recognize that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| I thought I saw Ben here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| So, Commissioner Anders has made a motion to send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| We have to do a roll call vote on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| Yeah, we'll send it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| The motion on the floor is to send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| It's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| We're going to have to do a roll call vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| There's a second from Commissioner Danley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| I was just here to see if there was any discussion on it and if I could answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| I recognize Commissioner Anders, followed by Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| Yeah, kind of what, you know, the staff recommended adding it to acceptable use on review, and the commission turned it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8050)|
| 2:14:21| I mean, there's much more disruptive business that you could add, and so what was the nature of the discussion about not doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8061)|
| 2:14:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| First, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| I actually, my assistant emailed everyone a letter today addressing both this, and there's also the deferred rezoning from September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8074)|
| 2:14:45| They focused on two things, and I go into detail in my letter about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8085)|
| 2:14:51| They were concerned about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| In particular, they raised an example of a transmission shop that is in the city where apparently vehicles are parked all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8096)|
| 2:15:04| The proposed amendment would prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| It would not be allowed to be parked in the front, and they would be limited to 30 days, and Mr. Green even offered we could reduce that to something less than 30 days if we wanted to, to be concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8109)|
| 2:15:21| The property in the city doesn't have the same restrictions on it that this amendment would impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8121)|
| 2:15:29| It's also about seven times smaller lot, so I think it was unfair to compare this particular piece of property that my client's interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8129)|
| 2:15:39| but even globally overall for a neighborhood commercial use to that property, which there's a completely different set of restrictions and availabilities for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8139)|
| 2:15:49| This is a lot more protective of this type of business in this particular zone, which is to offer neighborhood services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8149)|
| 2:15:59| and again, they said, well, we don't want to put too much work on codes that has to enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| Well, I really don't agree with that either, so those were the things that they were concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8164)|
| 2:16:10| I would encourage you to look at my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| I do go into detail about that if you have any questions, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| There's a lot more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| They're worried about what about oil and antifreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| We could put a gas station there with underground tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| So I don't know if maybe it's a failure on my part in explaining the differences in this as well before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8183)|
| 2:16:34| I'm hoping if that's the case I can correct that mistake before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| I'd just like to point out to the commission this is the second time in a row we seem to have changes to the neighborhood zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8204)|
| 2:16:54| in order to go to specific sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| Beer last time, microbreweries this time, a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| I'm not so sure that I like this global change to zoning, the whole ordinance of neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8223)|
| 2:17:10| as much as I would rather just look at these individual locations and change their zoning if what they're proposing fits that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8230)|
| 2:17:19| as opposed to making a countywide change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| Commissioner Anders, was this the one we had a couple of months ago in your district, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| It was Shawd and Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| Well, to some extent, Commissioner Smith's comments about the neighborhood commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8259)|
| 2:17:44| that was kind of a unique protected zone, and it seems like now everybody's trying to expand on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8264)|
| 2:17:52| and make it just a commercial node, and that's not what that is intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| And so I guess I can see why the MPC voted 14-0 to deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8277)|
| 2:18:04| because they still want to protect that neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8284)|
| 2:18:09| And I don't think we need to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8289)|
| 2:18:14| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| I think it's more along the lines of what is considered for it now versus something coming in less restrictive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8298)|
| 2:18:26| So right now he could bury gas tanks and run a gas station until midnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| but he can't run a transmission shop until 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| And that really doesn't make sense to a business guy that you're trying to place in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| That's kind of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| I think being site-specific is a good idea, but the limited uses that you put on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8321)|
| 2:18:48| I mean, you're asking for one less restrictive than ones that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| Right, but the whole idea was, when you talk about the gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| was to take those kind of entities that were needed out in residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| so that guy who's mowing his lawn on Saturday can come up and get a couple gallons of gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| Or the guy that don't want to tow his car 5 miles, 10 miles can tow it 1 mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| Well, those are usually, I mean, there's another situation in my district where it was a Weigel store went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8350)|
| 2:19:18| and then an auto repair shop went in, but that was because that was a zoned commercial, full commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8358)|
| 2:19:25| It was not zoned neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| I still think you need to protect the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| Well, this area is protected as neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| Yours was zoned commercial. You didn't have to rezone that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| Right, but the point is, once you allow that to come into, say, your neighborhood commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| it goes to then all of them, and that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| We've tried to come up with something to give commercial to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| but still make it restricted and still make it so that if there is a dentist office or an urgent care clinic or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8393)|
| 2:20:04| that those are the type of things they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| But if you're going to get your car repaired, it needs to go to a regular commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8406)|
| 2:20:14| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is that Amy back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| I'd like to hear from Amy. We're fortunate to have Amy from Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8421)|
| 2:20:28| My understanding is, did staff want recommended approval and then the commission voted to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8428)|
| 2:20:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| Could you help us out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| Amy, I think he wants a little bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| I've got a five-minute dissertation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| Staff did recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| I think that Director Green, he's probably said this at these meetings before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| that one of the challenges with the current zoning ordinance is that it's fairly dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| And so probably one of the reasons you've seen, over the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| the two amendments to the neighborhood commercial zone is because it is outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8462)|
| 2:21:08| and it doesn't reflect the current needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| And so there are some challenges associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| And so we've been trying to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| We recommended approval. The commission had some concerns and recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8479)|
| 2:21:26| A couple of those concerns have already been voiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| One of them was related to enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| the additional requirements of Knox County to actually go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| and enforce some of these businesses that might be located in the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8496)|
| 2:21:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| It was a, according to this, it was a 14-0 vote to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| You would think that there would have been some approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| I mean, 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| I'll go back and look at the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| I agree with Commissioner Andrews that, you know, I don't see anything wrong with that there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8517)|
| 2:22:04| especially when you have a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| So then Commissioner Schoonmaker and Mr. Smith are correct that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| you look at a neighborhood, you look at each piece of property that's there that's used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| because we do have an outdated code system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| And I'm not telling you we don't want to do recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| We just want to make sure that, and we'll have one next week on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| that you and I had a discussion zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| Instead of zoning to one certain zone, growth plan and everything else said you had to go to this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8552)|
| 2:22:39| but that don't fill what the property owner needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| So that'll be the Monday property that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| And we can't do industrial, not because of certain reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| So we'll have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| We have to look at each one as an individual and not as a whole as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8577)|
| 2:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8587)|
| 2:23:08| I just had a clarifying question, and I'm not sure who can answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8588)|
| 2:23:13| but if you had a gas station, a lot of times gas stations have a repair shop built in, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8593)|
| 2:23:21| Maybe not the new modern Weigels, but, you know, many times past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| Would that be allowed if you had a gas station with a repair shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| John, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| In neighborhood commercial, I believe there's a restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| You cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| It just has to be more of the like the Weigels of the pilot model where they can go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8616)|
| 2:23:42| and get bread, milk, gas, you know, lotto tickets, whatever, and then they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| And the other thing on neighborhood commercial is that when that gas station closes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8628)|
| 2:23:55| and that dentist office closes and that urgent care office closes, the parking lots are empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8635)|
| 2:24:02| They're not piled up with cars that are under repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| So, again, it's just how do you want your communities to look when you've got them right next to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8646)|
| 2:24:14| But did you want to add in something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| And neighborhood commercial is still one of the newest zoning regulations that we have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8658)|
| 2:24:25| Is that fairly, I mean, when you look at the RA zone and everything else, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| Can you say that in the microphones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| Yes, that's what I was going to say earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| But I have a question, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| So going back to the earlier discussion, are you saying it's a responsibility of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8679)|
| 2:24:48| to determine what we think types of businesses should and shouldn't be in a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8688)|
| 2:24:54| I mean, based on taste and preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| No, we went by what was originally laid out by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| of what kind of businesses that would be applicable for a neighborhood commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| to get them into residential neighborhoods as opposed to just going carte blanche with full commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8707)|
| 2:25:14| which could be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| You know, this was a step up for Knox County to be able to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| to go into neighborhood zones and put in services that they would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| basically on a daily basis, because you don't need to get your car repaired on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8724)|
| 2:25:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| Mr. Mullins, do you want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| I think for this first round, I have recognized all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| Now, the ones that I wanted to weigh back in were Commissioner Anderson and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| My only question or clarifying remark on this one is it appears, at least the way this is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8744)|
| 2:25:51| that you're not talking about were this to pass, this is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8751)|
| 2:25:58| This is not an automatic saying that these are uses that would be used in this proposed change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8758)|
| 2:26:05| that was recommended, then denied, and now appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| So were this to pass on appeal, then the actual change would be not an incident there allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8769)|
| 2:26:16| It would be use on review, which is a key clause in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| So I'm looking to both Ben and you and Amy for clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| And, Amy, if you could kind of weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| So they would still have to come back before the Planning Commission to evaluate the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8787)|
| 2:26:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8792)|
| 2:26:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| The Chair now recognizes Commissioner Anders and then back to Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| I'm trying to pull up this letter that we got today from the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| It had the list of things that are – and so with it making it use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8801)|
| 2:26:46| it does really take it into consideration parcel by parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| I mean, I think that's what we've been told by the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| You can have small appliance sales, self-service laundromat, equipment rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8814)|
| 2:27:01| I mean, you could open up a United Rentals there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| Demolition landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| You could have outdoor storage of materials, products, or equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8826)|
| 2:27:11| Self-storage facility or a fueling station with or without a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| All of those, to me, are more disturbing than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| or more impactful than having an auto repair shop that has restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8840)|
| 2:27:27| I mean, the town of Farragut didn't want Enterprise rental car to move in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8847)|
| 2:27:32| because they have restrictions on parking and cars out front and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| And so they worked with Enterprise to park all their cars around back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| They've got a great store on Kingston Park in the middle of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| I mean, it's just common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| And, you know, David Smoke was open to the idea once he heard that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| other towns similar to Farragut like Franklin and Brentwood do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| This allowing for a use on review makes it a parcel by parcel issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| And I think the more we hinder small businesses to get their work done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| I think the worse we are as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| And I think it's a good idea to include this in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8891)|
| 2:28:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| Amy, if someone applies for a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8893)|
| 2:28:19| and they can meet all the requirements of the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| there is no turning them down, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| It would be arbitrary and pretentious, wouldn't it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| if they could meet all the requirements needed for the use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8908)|
| 2:28:34| Staff would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| So the Planning Commission could make a recommendation of denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8915)|
| 2:28:40| if it was before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| But what would it be based upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| It really just would depend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| I mean, I can't really say in terms of without a specific case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| but it is within their purview to recommend denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| You can deny anything but hold up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8940)|
| 2:29:01| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| That's the risk that they would take if it met all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8942)|
| 2:29:07| I don't want to open up neighborhood commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| to any broader things than they already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| But this particular site that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| I have no problem zoning that planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| It's not really in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| It could be under a PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| The review that's on it could make this work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8967)|
| 2:29:34| I just don't know why we want to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| It seems like any time somebody's got a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| we get an ordinance change coming along with it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| It was before us for planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| No, we sent it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| Right, because of this very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| And now it comes back with they also added an ordinance to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| and it's coming back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| That's what we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| We didn't ask for the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| We asked them to review it for an ordinance, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| Yeah, we sent it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| We can still just pass the planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| Okay, back to you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| This is my last chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| I encourage everybody to go to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| and look at Article V, Section .38, so it would be 5.38,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9020)|
| 2:30:27| and to clarify something, if you had a, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| you could have equipment rental, but nothing that goes on a highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| So you're talking about weed eaters and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| It's nothing that could actually be driven on a highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| They also put in the ordinance that you could have a veterinarian office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| or an animal clinic there, but you cannot board pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9046)|
| 2:30:52| because neighborhoods don't want to hear the dogs barking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| at 3 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| And the other thing is, yes, there's a caption in there that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| you could have a demolition landfill as long as it's less than one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9059)|
| 2:31:05| Well, that's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| Who's going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| So that doesn't even make any sense anyways, but it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| But the whole idea was built, it was designed for attorneys' offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121business?start=9071)|
