| 0:03:31| D as in dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=211)|

| 0:03:42| No, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| I'm on the wrong page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| My fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| My fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Okay, for the Mayor's Report, first I want to talk a little bit about the deluge that we just lived through last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| We were already in the midst of one of the wettest Februaries on record, and then last weekend we broke the old record set in 1873.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=238)|
| 0:04:08| Rainfall varied throughout the city, but the average rainfall was 5.25 inches, which fell between what are referred to as the 10-year and the 25-year rainfall events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=248)|
| 0:04:20| In other words, models show that that amount of rain is expected to fall only once every 10 or 25 years, depending on which area it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=260)|
| 0:04:29| The station that recorded the highest rainfall was off Walden Drive in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| Rain there hit a 100-year mark for a 24-hour rainfall, and it fell just shy of being a 200-year rainfall event for a 20-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=274)|
| 0:04:44| The results of so much rain, when the soils were already saturated, was devastating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| At the peak, 143 city roads were closed by high water, and hundreds of houses and businesses suffered structural damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=289)|
| 0:04:58| Lots of trees fell. Actually, not as many as we anticipated, but trees fell and some electricity was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| I know Becky Wade and I, in our neighborhood, a tree fell over Woodlawn Pike and we lost electricity for about 12 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| So I know it happened to people, but KUB crews were out there right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| Today, as of our last checking, there were still about, in the city, about 13 street closures continuing today in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=318)|
| 0:05:28| We know there are more out in the county, outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| Chilhowee Park is still flooded. Zoo Knoxville and the Tyson Park playground are still closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| If you visit the City of Knoxville's Facebook page, we'll make regular updates as different public facilities get back open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| I want to take a minute to thank all of our public employees who responded so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| Firefighters and police officers scrambled immediately to perform water rescues and to divert motorists away from dangerous water-covered roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=351)|
| 0:06:00| The Knoxville-Knox County Emergency Operations Center, the EOC, and Colin Ickes is here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| was activated early Saturday morning to coordinate responses from multiple agencies across the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| They all come together there to coordinate response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Our stormwater and our traffic engineers and public service crews worked as teams to devise and mark detour routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| to provide expertise on controlling runoff whenever possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| They cut up and removed trees that had fallen to get the roads reopened, and KUB crews did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| Our communications teams, both police, fire, and the city government were all active and coordinating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=395)|
| 0:06:42| trying to get the message out to as many people as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| Knoxville Area Transit responded as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| CAT supervisors were out early Saturday morning mapping out detours around spots where water was blocking streets and bus shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=409)|
| 0:06:58| CAT made dozens of detours throughout the weekend as conditions changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| but service was never discontinued on any route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| As their hashtag says, CAT goes there, and they did on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| Our residents expect and deserve a coordinated, all-out response during a crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| and I'm proud of the skill and professionalism demonstrated by all of these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| Without their rescues and management of traffic and all the other things I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| the toll from the weekend could have been much worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| So now, while everything is still subsiding, water is still subsiding, there's still water in my basement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| I don't know about the rest of you, and while we're starting to dry out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| we are moving on to the next step to document the damage for insurance purposes and for possible FEMA assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=458)|
| 0:07:46| We need your help with this next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| City and county employees, along with private fire and ambulance personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| have begun documenting damages not only to city facilities, but to private houses and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| Uniformed first responders have been making visits and will be making visits to many, but not all, of the damaged properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=481)|
| 0:08:10| We're encouraging property owners, whether it's your house or your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| to call 311 or you can call 865-215-4311 to report significant damage to your homes or buildings, to your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=495)|
| 0:08:27| The damage assessment will be forwarded to TEMA, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| which will collect data from multiple communities to see if the damage estimate reaches a threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| to qualify for application for possible federal assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| Now, these numbers, I'm going to tell you, will likely go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| but earlier today we were aware of reported damage to about 800 to 900 homes and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| so keep calling in. We need to know exactly what the extent of the damage is, so please call 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| I also want to remind council that we do maintenance on our drainage infrastructure year-round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| This proactive approach reduces the impact when we experience something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| If we didn't do this year-round maintenance, we'd have quite a bit more damage than we already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| For example, last year our stormwater teams responded to more than 700 stormwater calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=558)|
| 0:09:26| and that led to about 240 or so work orders for maintenance or construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| So to wrap up, again, I want to thank all of those I've mentioned who responded during this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| I also want to thank all the individuals who reached out to help their neighbors and others in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| I saw a lot of this on Facebook as people were trying to connect with one another and see what they needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| and it really does, when you have something like this, it takes a whole community to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| to get through something like we had last weekend, so thank you to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Before we move on, I want to see if council has any questions about that response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| or for any of our teams that are here about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| If not, then feel free to contact us or call in or police or fire if you have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| or if any of your constituents do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| So I'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| I want to remind everyone that February is Black History Month, and as the month winds down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| we encourage you to visit the city website at knoxvilletn.gov slash blackhistory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| The city's communications department team, over several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| has compiled a series of blog posts and video interviews that document the lives and experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| of African-American residents who have played a key role in city government or in civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| New material added this month is worth checking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=646)|

| 0:13:39| But we still have a lot of work to do in some areas, such as opioid overdose deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| suicide attempts among youth, and pedestrian and bicycle crashes with cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=823)|

| 0:24:42| Thank you. Thank you so much, Mayor. Good evening, everyone. For the record, I'm David Williams, 505 Hollywood Drive, a lifelong resident of Pond Gap Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1482)|
| 0:24:52| My Pond Gap neighbors and I oppose this resolution. Government should not be in the housing business, affordable or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1492)|
| 0:25:00| What comes next? Government, affordable cars, government, affordable vacations, government, affordable entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1500)|
| 0:25:11| The dinner, a movie or an ice bears hockey game. Where do we draw the line? Please remember you're spending taxpayers money that all of us work very hard to earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1511)|
| 0:25:24| These funds can be better spent on solving traffic problems. There are many around the city. Building sidewalks or repairing retaining walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1524)|
| 0:25:34| I repeat, repairing retaining walls. Repairing retaining walls. There's a story behind that I'll go into later. Take too much time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1534)|
| 0:25:43| Also, a good portion of this money could simply be saved. I know that's rare in government to save money. It's about as rare as a left-handed third baseman in baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1543)|
| 0:25:55| Thomas Jefferson said, bad government results from too much government. Barry Goldwater stated, if you cherish freedom, don't leave it all up to government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1555)|
| 0:26:04| Remember the Constitution says we need to limit government and that's the instrument we need to be using. Government governs best when it governs least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1564)|
| 0:26:15| Do we want the government to enter more and more areas of our daily private lives? I think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| Well, what can be done? It's easy to criticize, but you need to come up with a solution. And we have in Pond Gap. It's called private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1581)|
| 0:26:30| In Pond Gap, the wonderful neighborhood that I was born and raised in, we have a gentleman that's working to provide affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| One beautiful house has already been built and he's working on several more. It fits perfectly into our neighborhood and the community accepts this and grasps it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1598)|
| 0:26:50| We do oppose the apartment project because it doesn't fit in our community and we think it will harm our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| Please stop Knoxville's march toward socialism. Let's draw the line here and now. Please vote no on this resolution because I feel in your heart you know I'm right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1617)|
| 0:27:09| Thank you, Mr. Williams. Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| Thank you. I wanted to ask Becky Wade just to kind of review the process, the scrutiny that both these projects, 11A and 11B, go under to get this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1636)|
| 0:27:30| I mean, it's done with a process. It's done with a great amount of scrutiny and I just kind of wanted to review that just ever so briefly to talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| Sure. Good evening. Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| The fund was established to help incentivize the creation of new affordable rental units in Knoxville, which is a dire need in the city and that's why the fund was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1664)|
| 0:27:56| We wrote guidelines to administer the fund and there's an application process that developers make with our department and then we go through a review of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| That includes reviewing the development budget as well as the operating budget to make sure that there is actually a gap in funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1683)|
| 0:28:21| As you know, affordable housing developments have caps on their rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| So the operating flow, cash flow, that comes into those developments is less than a market rate development would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1707)|
| 0:28:36| Therefore, they can't take on as much debt. Low income housing tax credits help to fill that debt, that gap, but our fund, it doesn't make it all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1716)|
| 0:28:49| And so there is a legitimate gap in the developments that are before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| We are restricting a number of units based on our program guidelines, which is 30,000 per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| However, the entire development for both of them, the 102 units at Pond Gap and the 156 units at Young High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1742)|
| 0:29:13| they are all affordable and will remain affordable for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| It's a forgiving loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| Correct. It's forgiven over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| One twentieth of it each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| And it's secured with a deed of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| I just think that's important to recognize that actually there's a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| I mean the cost of site work and the cost of building materials is all the same no matter what the rent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| So it's important to fill that gap of what it's going to cost to build it and what it's going to cost to cash flow the property for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| So I support it and I appreciate you bringing that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| I just want to thank the administration for starting this fund, realizing that we did have a problem in the affordable housing, creating the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1800)|
| 0:30:09| I can't remember what year it was created, but creating the fund a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| And seeing that fruit borne out with 258 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| So I think it's quite an accomplishment for council and administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| I just want that to be noted and thank you for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| I'm in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| I was when we talked about it last and here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| This is a gap-filling measure, which I think is addressing something that's really critical in our city, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| And it's a good way for us to try to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| I want to express my appreciation of my fellow colleagues for the very lengthy discussion we had with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1847)|
| 0:30:56| And I want to thank the neighborhood for also coming and expressing their concerns and giving us the opportunity to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| So I would suggest we go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Thank you. I would like to add that I think community development has done a great job in putting this program together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| We absolutely believe that it is our role to invest in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| In this case, it is really leveraging private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| This is a private sector development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Sometimes we work with our nonprofit housing developers or our public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| But in this case, it is private enterprise that is building it, and we are filling the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| So kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you for recognizing the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| And by the way, there's such a demand on this that I've mentioned this to you all before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| But I think in our next two weeks from now, we'll be coming with a budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| which will include another million dollars to add to the two and a half for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| in order to keep the projects that are in the pipeline that community development is working on to keep them flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=1910)|

| 0:35:04| some exceptions we've made in the past have allowed people to come up and speak for up to three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| and that way we can hear from more people and it won't delay the agenda too long for other matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| and people who are waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| So I'm going to call out your names, and I'll call you each again as it's your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| but Chris Battle, Vance Sherwood, Julie Gautreaux. Did I say it right this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you, Julie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Imani M., Eli Stanfill, and David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2132)|
| 0:35:42| Okay, so that will be the order and timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| You can set the timer for up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Okay, it's set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Okay, first, Pastor Battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| I think Ms. Scheib also wanted to speak on that issue. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| We have her down for public forum. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| It's on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| On this issue, so do you want to be then included now? Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| All right, let me change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Pastor Battle, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| and if you don't mind watching the timer above my head here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Chris Battle, 1626 Kenroe Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| On the surface, this resolution seems innocent enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| It can even come across as good and helpful to the inmates that would be affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| since it engages them in work, which is universally seen as dignifying and meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| Upon further examination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| it becomes apparent that this resolution could encourage a gross form of exploitation and involuntary servitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| The larger issue, the Prison Policy Initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| states that Tennessee has an extremely disproportionate rate of incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| Tennessee imprisons 853 people for every 1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| This is 20% higher than the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Now consider the range of pay for inmate labor in Tennessee is between 17 and 75 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| Even at its high end, this is only 10% of Tennessee's minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| Prison labor produced over $2 billion in goods in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| with a population of 1.5 million in the U.S. alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| In the last 15 years, the prison population has increased to 2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| In turn, we must consider the tremendous economic impact from prison labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| and those industries and businesses that benefit the most from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| The sad truth is that too many are making money off the backs of those who are incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| without compensating at least a minimum wage to those who are actually doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| This is especially concerning to me considering the high cost of being incarcerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| from bonds, court costs, to the commissary and videoconferencing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| The immediate and local issue is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| It is my understanding that inmate labor in Knox County is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| I'm sure inmates would prefer to be outside working than sitting inside a jail cell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| especially when there are benefits to participating in that this work can lead to a reduction of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2297)|
| 0:38:25| I also agree that there is dignity in work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| However, I think that it is morally wrong to not compensate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| and to not compensate them fairly for their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| So I raise this question tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| Does the value of their labor plus the reduction of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| equal what an employed person doing the same work would receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| If it does not, then I could not support this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| We have a moral responsibility to compensate these citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| and we have a responsibility to compensate them fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Thank you, Pastor Battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2344)|
| 0:39:12| Vance Sherwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Please state your name and address for the record if you don't mind watching the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| My name is Vance Sherwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| I'm a psychologist here in Knoxville, 300 West End Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| and I'd like to speak along the same lines as Pastor Battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| I think that the city council would do well to stay as far away from the sheriff's jail policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| as humanly possible for the following reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| It appears to me that the idea is to have inmates work for free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| and then return to jail where they have to pay for everything that they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| And by pay for everything they get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| I mean that they have to pay for the privilege of speaking with their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| or for e-mails or for postcards to communicate with anybody or for the food that they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| well, I assume that you guys know that the diet at the jail is inadequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| and as proof of that I can say that there was a suit filed at the end of last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| in which nearly everybody in the suit, the class action suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| had lost a significant amount of weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| and one gentleman had lost 100 pounds in the course of three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| So they paid not only for their communication with their family and for e-mail and for medical care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| which is not very good to begin with, and for their postcards and for food if they want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| and then to add insult to injury, if their families have not been bankrupted by these policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| and send them some money for their account, the jail will take a cut of that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| Now, I think that this is a bad policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| I think it's bad optics, and I think it's bad morality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| and I do not believe that the city of Knoxville should have any truck with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| no pun intended, and I think that you should stay as far away from this policy as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| Therefore, I don't believe that you should let the county sheriff use your trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| I think, in fact, if you have any political weight to bring to bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| it should be against the policies that the sheriff has in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| which are an attempt to prey on the most powerless and poor among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| I just point out that the people in the jail, for the vast majority of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| have not been convicted of anything anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| and I'm not quite clear why we should be profiting from their labor at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| that we expect them to pay for the privilege of being in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Now, there are some things they don't pay for, and I'll finish up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| They don't pay for the fact that the jail is overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| That's for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| They don't pay for the fact that there aren't enough staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| That's for free also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| And they don't pay for the increased level of violence in the jail over the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| and that's according to the sheriff's own statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| That's for free also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Everything else they pay for, and we should pay them if they're going to work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| Julie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Julie Gautreaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Please state your name and address for the record and watch the timer above my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Julie Gautreaux, 1101 Liberty Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I'm not going to take up much of your time because I ran my mouth a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| but I just want to maybe clarify some things, and I appreciate Mr. Sherwood's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| I would clarify being a public defender and having lots of people that I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| housed at the detention facility, I know that they are provided with food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| I also concur that they are not provided with a sufficient diet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| and a lot of them compensate for that by buying extra commissary items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| I could tell you anecdotes that are kind of heartbreaking to illustrate that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| but I'm not going to belabor it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| I am informed, of course, and I'm aware of the fact that inmate crews are volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| It's a particularly unusual context for volunteering, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2575)|
| 0:43:05| When you're locked in a cell for 23 hours of seven days per week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| you're probably going to volunteer for whatever work somebody offers to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| So I don't think that the argument that they are volunteers is particularly persuasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| The sheriff has said, I believe, that he doesn't have budget to pay them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| and I would counterpoint by saying that until the county reassigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| some of its budget priorities to include compensating inmate workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| the city should withhold these trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| The money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| The sheriff is expecting a multimillion-dollar building budget for the DF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| so there is money to help offset the money that these workers feed into J-PAY,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| which is a subsidiary of Securus, the communications company that they have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| to talk to their loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| For whatever other tiny comforts are available in the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| these inmates, workers, men and women, have to pay through the nose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| for the entire time that they're housed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| And so I hope that people are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| I hope that we act in accordance with our moral principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| that people who work should be paid, particularly under the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| that exist at the Knox County Detention Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2662)|

| 0:44:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Okay, I go by Imani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| I live in 9348 Ridges Meadow Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| A vote for this would be a vote for free labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| and the only term I know for that would be slavery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| A vote for this would start a system where being in prison would bring profit to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| The work that these inmates are doing for free is work that the city doesn't have to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| On top of that, and the last thing I will say, is that once they do this work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| once they are released, they cannot get that same job by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| So if you want to come up with a policy, if these people are volunteering for this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| pay them and then allow them to get a job that pays a living wage when they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2728)|
| 0:45:37| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| My name is Eli Stanfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I live at 718 Chickamauga Avenue in District 5 in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| and I'm here today as the co-chair of Jobs with Justice of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| You have heard from us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| We are a coalition of community, faith, student, and labor organizations in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| including many labor unions in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| and so I feel particularly qualified to speak to you about the simple truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| that all people who are working should be paid for their labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| whether or not legally it's considered to be a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| It's a very basic thing to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| and yet it seems that our jails don't honor that very basic truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| When I was a student years ago at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| one of the first things I did in Knoxville getting involved in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| was I was involved in a project that was investigating conditions in our jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| and it was a very eye-opening experience for me in a very bad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| I had no idea of the many things that people are deprived of in our jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| including in-person visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| As people have said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| the inmates in our jails have to videoconference with their family and their friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| and that is very expensive on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| And so that just adds insult to the injury of not being paid for this work that they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| that we're in fact relying on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| I know that the city council does not govern the jail and what happens in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| That's the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| But at the same time, the decision you make here does carry weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| You do have power over this right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| and often we see when things are passing between the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| it's really just a rubber stamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| But if you rubber stamp this, you are endorsing the free labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| that the sheriff's office is extracting from these inmates who, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| have not been convicted, most of them of any crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| And so what I would ask is that you have courage tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| and you don't endorse that practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| that you recognize that there is something very heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| if you pass this resolution to transfer these trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| that you're condoning slavery, as has been said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| and that's, you know, I shouldn't have to say, immoral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| and it shouldn't be happening in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| And so as a citizen who lives here, as your constituent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| and in my position as the co-chair of Jobs with Justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| I would urge you to do the right thing and vote against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| And you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| My name is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| I live in 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| I'm a proud member of the city council movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| and also a candidate in this upcoming city council election for seat B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| So I have a couple questions that I asked myself before coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| And that is, what type of city do we want to live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| and what type of values should be reflected in our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| So my answer to those would be we should be living in a democratic city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| and we should have values that reflect human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| And I think a lot of people in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| if not every single person at least behind me, would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| So what do I mean by democratic city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| I mean that people should have the right to have an input and a say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| in how the city runs and its operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| And beyond that, that communities should have the final say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| in decisions that affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| The people should be able to ask and solve the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| why does the city support inmate labor but not black contractors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| Now, if you don't know anything about that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| black contractors receive less than 1% of the total contracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| Yet we're having free inmate labor doing projects for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| Our values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I believe our values should center human rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| and the rights of all people, even those in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| just like the folks who spoke before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| Now, does creating a cradle-to-jail pipeline for black and brown people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| poor and working class people, reflect human rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| Does not paying workers who use their sweat and their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| to get out of a horrible situation to come out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| and to work on city projects and not pay them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| does that reflect human rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| Does expanding a jail instead of dramatically increasing housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| and social services and increasing funding to housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| and social services and community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| does that reflect human rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Does having a jail with brutal conditions and no face-to-face visits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| A few people got up here and talked about the condition that folks are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Does supporting that institution and using that labor support human rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| Now, I'm going to ask you to make one small decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| and one small step towards actual democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| You've heard people, you've heard the people coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| people in communities come and say how they felt about the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| They gave their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| We're asking you to take that into deliberation in the act of democracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| and make one small step towards human rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| and say you do not accept inmate labor, you do not accept free labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| and you do not accept slave labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| Here, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| and you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Vivian Schein, 109 South Gallagher Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| Many years ago I walked out of a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| when my professor said to me these words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| the ends justify the means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Slaves were a business necessity necessary to get the work done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| of building this great country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| The lesson plan for that day was slave trade as an expense of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| I want to take a moment and share with you two moments in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| from a time traveler's observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| The first observation happened today, February 27, 2019, at 6.32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| And I saw those who were to set off in a couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| in two lease trucks with provisions and other needs for such a day's journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| Their place of destination, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| For the purpose of delivering free labor by inmates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| I observed these trucks of great importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| as these inmates must arrive at their workplace in good condition and in good order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| Yes, yes, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| They are chained lest they overtake their guards, and yes, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Those guards shall have control over them during their work shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| The guards are well armed, of course, no worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| After observing all of this discussion and after deliberating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| I took leave of this council meeting and I returned home to my comfortable lodging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| remunerating to myself about man's inhumanity to man in the year of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| But then the time traveler travels on, and the same words will be spoken again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| And this time the words that you hear say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| And I saw those who were to set off in a couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3208)|

| 0:53:41| Their place of destination is Natchez for the purpose of disposing them upon arrival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| It is an object of great importance and observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| that these slaves arrive at their destination in good order and well conditioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Yes, yes, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| They are chained, lest they overtake their masters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| And it is true, the three or four men shall have charge over them during this journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| Their guards and conductors are well armed, of course, no worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| After observing this, all of this, and after resting myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| I took leave of this establishment and I returned to my comfortable lodging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3256)|

| 0:54:47| Don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3289)|
| 0:55:03| At the end of the speakers, Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you everyone who signed up and spoke on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| Mr. Bryce, could you give us an overview very briefly on the Inmate Community Service Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| I do think that there are a few points of clarification that I'd like for the audience to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| Yes, thank you, Councilwoman McKenzie and City Council and Mayor Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| and Ms. Gutro was at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| and I appreciate the opportunity to have two additional weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| You know, we get busy in public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| and so it was great to take what I'll call a deep dive into a program that we've been engaged with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| with the Sheriff's Department and the Sheriff, really for my time at the city over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| So I think the discussion, the dialogue has been incredibly helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| and I've appreciated the concern about mass incarceration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| and exploiting those who are within the prison system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| Obviously, that issue is something we need to talk about as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| I did meet with, and we would never, let me say this, as a member of the Mayor's Cabinet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| I can assure you that the Mayor would not want any programs managed by her team and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| that would be exploitive of or detrimental to individuals in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| especially those that are in the system that the Sheriff's Department manages at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| So I did meet with Sheriff Spangler and had a very good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| I relayed those concerns, both the, what I'll call the systems level concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| about privatization of prisons and the corporate overtaking of our jail and prison system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| And we had a good discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| We also talked specifically about the inmate work program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| and I did, I wanted to confirm much of the information that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| I did send that out in an email to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| I also had a good discussion with Ms. Gautreaux yesterday about that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| and that we're really not that far apart on the concerns related or that have been communicated today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| So, but it is important to note that all of the participants do sign up for the program and volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3426)|
| 0:57:14| and obviously issues have been raised about the concept of volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Well, you're in an incarcerated situation, but they do sign up and volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| They first pass a physical test prior to volunteering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| and they're actually in the facility for a certain amount of time so they can monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| do they have health issues, mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| and can they be within the program outside of the confines of the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| And so they are there for several weeks or months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| Most are there for minor nonviolent offenses, such as failure to pay child support, DUIs, drug charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3468)|
| 0:57:57| This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| So there's really two programs within the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| There's inmate labor within the jail system, and there's inmate labor that we utilize outside of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3481)|
| 0:58:09| The folks that participate outside of the facility have all been convicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| so these are not folks waiting to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| These are folks that, and I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| Mr. Swanson, if there's questions, can chime in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| But these are folks that have either had a plea deal or an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| or they have been convicted by a judge or jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| And, again, I'm not that familiar with the criminal defense system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| but they are not waiting for their day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| The participants in the program are changing constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Most of these folks are in the facility for at least 150 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| By the time they come in, their health check, they sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| There's a list of folks that sign up, so they work their way down on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| They're in the facility for at least 150, 160 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| So that's the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| The benefits, and when I looked at what those benefits are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| one of the most important is the state law does require one day worked in the field is a day off of your sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| And so there is a sentence reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Most of those who volunteer in the program are folks that would prefer to be outside of the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| and that issue has been raised about volunteering in an incarcerated situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| but they do prefer to be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| They receive a non-jail lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| And so Mr. Chadwith is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Chad, if you'll raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| He is the service director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| And several years ago, we actually set up a specific account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| so that we can buy quality meals for these mostly gentlemen that are on these work crews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| And so it may be, you know, a firehouse sub or pizzas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| or we may go buy Panero bread and buy a good meal and bottled water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| We also provide, depending on the work they're providing, gloves and personal protective equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| And, again, those are things that I think we helped implement over time through the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| to make sure they had the PPE and they had a good meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| And, you know, a bit of this is anecdotal, but there are job skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| So they do everything from removing carpet to demolition of an interior building to landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| They also do masonry work, pouring concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| And we are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| I don't have the statistics on it, but I'm aware that there are individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| For example, we assist, the inmate program assists, with nonprofit events like Fantasy of Trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| and that folks who have engaged with and had a relationship with the folks at Fantasy of Trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| once they have left their incarceration, they have been hired into positions in landscaping companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| And, again, this is anecdotal, but the personnel and public service, Chad and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| we actually have an employee that oversees that program, Greg Ladd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| And, again, this is anecdotal, but they do express a pleasure of being out of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| Obviously, there's been discussions about conditions in the facility, and they prefer to be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| So there are some other benefits overall to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| Folks that participate are significantly less likely to be involved in altercations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| and or problems within the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| And I think this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| So the individuals that are out working are not completing, for the most part, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3697)|
| 1:01:45| the vast majority of the projects they work on are not projects that the city is deferring to the inmate crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3705)|
| 1:01:53| There's no revenue produced from any of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| And the projects, and I'm just going to give you some examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| are oftentimes we receive calls from members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| perhaps a senior citizen that has a heavily overgrown or a disabled citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| that has a heavily overgrown backyard and just doesn't have the resources to cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Our codes enforcement team may identify the fact that this individual doesn't have the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| and we can call on the inmate labor to help that citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| There was a nonprofit disability services nonprofit that needed their parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| They called and said, Hey, David, we need our parking lot cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| I can't go on to private property as the city of Knoxville without a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| But we provided some supplies, I believe from our transfer station, some paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| The inmates went out, cleaned that parking lot, and re-striped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| And probably one of the most longstanding programs that I've been involved with, not programs, but projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| so the Odd Fellows Cemetery and the Richmond Hill Cemetery and the Pottersfield Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| These are historic cemeteries in Knoxville that they're owned privately, but there is no ownership entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| So imagine a 100- or 200-year-old cemetery that doesn't have an entity to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| These are not projects we would be able to take on through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| and our codes enforcement team may go in and occasionally cut back a little brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| But Odd Fellows and Richmond Hill are a great example of areas that were completely overgrown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| where we've worked with the Sheriff's Department inmate crew to clean and make those actually an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| So if you get a chance, I think Odd Fellows is a great example, if you'd like to go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| And now the Beck Center and the Reanimation Coalition and the University of Tennessee Architecture Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| Once it was clear, they took that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| I think, again, there are no chains, there are no guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| Lunch is provided, they are volunteers, and I do appreciate the opportunity to do a deep dive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| and make sure that what we're doing does not have a direct negative impact on the individuals in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| So I hope that answered your question, and we do care about these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| and we want to make sure that our program is not detrimental to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| I do want to add that through this resolution it has actually shined the light on this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| and what this program actually looks like and how it benefits not only the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| but also the city and county through that labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| I'm not opposed to this program the way that it is designed because if a person is incarcerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| I'm sure being able to get a day off of your sentence is very valuable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| However, when we look at this and we see that there are nonviolent offenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| such as failure to pay child support, that indicates to me that there is a person experiencing financial hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3880)|
| 1:04:48| and this is the reason why they have been sentenced and serving jail time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| One thing that I do know is that regardless of whether you're in jail or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| your child support continues to accrue while you're in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| And so for a person who already had a financial hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| being incarcerated continues to compound that financial hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| which to me says that that increases the likelihood of recidivism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| for a person who is in there under those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| I would like to see at some point, and I know that this body cannot change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| but can definitely start the conversation and looking at what does this program look like in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| even if it's a daily flat rate for an inmate who volunteers for the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| that could be used for either their commissary or maybe perhaps it could go toward their back child support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| So I would look forward to us pursuing that conversation for those of us who are interested in looking at this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3940)|
| 1:05:48| So because of that alone, I would not be supporting this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| and in hopes that we will be able to work further in the future with the sheriff as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| to look at how can we make this more, I'm not even going to say profitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| but something that would actually assist these inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| other than just giving them the benefit of getting out of their cell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| the benefit of reducing their time, but also being able to assist those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| who have those financial hardships in some shape, form, or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Mr. Brace, you mentioned that there was a special account that the city has made to buy these lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| Well, so the city does not routinely buy food, and so we buy food typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=3995)|
| 1:06:45| we don't buy food for meetings, we don't buy food for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| It has to be pre-approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| So several years ago when we started this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| it became incredibly cumbersome for us to go to the comptroller three days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| and request that we go to the firehouse subs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| and so we now have an account and an authorization to buy food through public service operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| to buy lunches for these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| It's really just an efficiency for our operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| They know the food is for a good program, and so we've got tight controls on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| So is that an account that we can expand and pay them for their days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| I mean, I think there's always the opportunity to pay inmate labor is a broader policy issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4047)|
| 1:07:36| and again, Mr. Swanson and others can look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| Fair Labor Standards Act, when you're paying someone, do you need a 990?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| How does that impact workman's comp and that relationship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| So I think that is something that Mayor O'Hara and I had discussed previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| She asked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Could we look at a program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| And so that's something we'll need to dig into because there are implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| That becomes right now we have a lease and we identify projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| and then those projects are implemented by the sheriff inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| We're not in direct supervisory control of the inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| They're managed by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| And so engaging in payment, it brings up a host of other legal fair labor standard issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| that we'll need to look at, and I think we're willing to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| I know the mayor said, hey, this is something that we need to engage with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| At a minimum, could we provide some toiletry expenses at the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| There's ways to incrementally look at that, and so it's not as easy as can we pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| I think, sure, if the mayor and council wanted to find a certain amount of money to assist with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| but the contracts and what that opens up legally, I'm not aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| and I think we'd have to dig into that in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| And Chad did text me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| There was one other very important program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| The inmates at the facility, this is not necessarily the city program, but the county work they do as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| They also have a firewood program, so there are folks that don't have heating in their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| and they split firewood, and they deliver it to low- to modern-income families throughout the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| and the city portions of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| The county is the city, and they also provide that service to help with winter home warmth needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| during the cold months, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| I think that if the city can figure out how to pay all of these contractors and all the city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| it's something that we can figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| If we cannot pay them directly, at least we can help them pay for their day-to-day expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| much like I'm piggybacking on what Councilwoman Gwen McKenzie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Yeah, I really appreciate this issue bubbling up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| because this was an issue that obviously I certainly was surprised by at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| If you looked at my face, you must have noted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| Nevertheless, you know, I think I would ask my colleagues to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| I don't think by turning this down we're going to promote where we're trying to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| and I think ultimately we need to move the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| I don't think there's any question about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| and I think the conversations that have begun and that we are being shared with tonight are the start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| and I hope not the end of that, but that we will go ahead and pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| and then take those steps that may be necessary, because this is not a real simple situation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4236)|
| 1:10:44| I wish it were, but it's not, and I hope that we will pursue that and suspect that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| I have every faith that we will pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I would encourage my colleagues to vote favorably for this resolution and then continue the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4254)|
| 1:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| I think I'm just going to echo some of what I've already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| I believe that these inmates need to be paid for this labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| and I think we need to figure out a way to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| but it's not just as easy as today they're not being paid and tomorrow they're going to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| So the unintended potential consequences of not approving this agreement would be there's no relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4284)|
| 1:11:34| between the city and the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| The inmates that are currently able to volunteer and able to get out into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| earn some job skills, interact in a productive manner, they lose that ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| and we're not solving the problem of potential compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| So one thing that I would like to consider is seeing if we can amend this contract to make it a one-year contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4313)|
| 1:12:02| and that would give us a year to come back to the table with a plan for compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| So that's one thing I might ask my colleagues to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| and I don't know how I would make that as an amended motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| but I would not reconsider a contract that doesn't include a plan for compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Mr. Brace, I would like to echo the same comments we're hearing from my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| and that would be to look into whether or not there is some type of compensation we can get for these volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| when they're doing city projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| I think that is something very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| I also want to thank Councilmember St. Perez for setting up that tour of the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| Sheriff Spangler and his staff, including Assistant Chief Bivens and Communications Director Glenn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| for providing counsel with an open and very transparent tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| What I noticed in the tour was that the men and women that were working there are very dedicated professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| and I appreciate that they're doing the best they can with the resources that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| We've talked a lot about what the program looks like, and I don't need to re-echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| But following our tour, I did reach out to our county counterparts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| and I learned that County Mayor Jacobs has an active Justice Review Committee working on criminal justice reform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| including a review of the whole system, pretrial release, probation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| and they're also looking at possible expansion of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| I fully support these counties' efforts in these areas, and I think they're very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| We should all be concerned about the conditions in the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| that those in the facility have the ability to communicate with their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| that options exist for in-person visitation, and that volunteers who work are compensated for their labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| So I certainly echo what we're hearing this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| These lease agreements that we're considering today do not address these important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| They only address the city leasing two pickup trucks to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| I don't want to see us take action tonight that might derail the active work towards criminal justice reform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| that the county is undertaking at this time, or in any way communicate anything except support for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| So even after hearing from constituents tonight, and I really appreciate everything everyone said, I support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4467)|
| 1:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| So Councilwoman Welch kind of beat me to the idea of an amended version of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| and looking at the dates for the contract, this contract is for October 28, 2018 to October 28, 2020, and you had suggested a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4489)|
| 1:15:02| I would like to suggest an amendment to this, an amended motion, if it's possible, because it's a resolution contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4502)|
| 1:15:12| to have a contract that goes to October 28, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| That means it would come before this council before we go to election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| It would be heard by this council and discussed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| I am, incidentally to everyone here, Councilwoman Singh-Perez arranged for us to have a tour of the facilities at Maloneyville Road prior to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4525)|
| 1:15:38| us knowing this was ever coming our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| So very timely, interestingly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| And one of the comments that the communications director made to us was though the arrestees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| the inmates that are picked up by KPD do go to the facility, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| we didn't vote on things that pertain to the jail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| And I said, well, ironically we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| We have something that was delayed and is coming up before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| So I think it was a very timely and worthwhile thing for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| It actually was a nicer facility than what I anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| And I'm not saying that it's per se nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| I'm just saying it exceeded my expectations in terms of what we saw there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| What was important to me in terms of what we're being asked to for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| who's participating in this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| is that the information we are being provided with is that they are required by law to have a reduction in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| and, very critically, it is not people who are there for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| People who are still in jail because they can't pay their bond and they're awaiting trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| do not get to participate in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| This is people who have been convicted and have a sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| and it allows them to have time off their sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| And for that reason, I'm not sure I want to throw the baby with the bathwater out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| I think there's maybe look at how we improve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| because I think in terms of prison reform, there are other things that we could look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| like bond reform, that this body, though we don't vote on these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| we can make a statement, we can make a resolution that we send forward to our state legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| and to the county to discuss things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| as well as one of the things that the county, that Councilman Roberto has commented on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| is that they are doing a lot of evaluation because there's discussion about expanding the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| and adding to it for overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| And so the question lies, is a lot of the overcrowding happening because of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| that wouldn't necessarily be there if there were bond reform, if there were criminal justice reform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| folks that are sitting there because they can't afford to pay their bonds to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| because their poverty is keeping them tied there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| as well as all of the mentally ill that are there because they end up in a cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| and stuck there because we don't have adequate mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| And I think those are things that we as a body can make a statement about if we choose to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| even though we don't necessarily vote on those issues and they're not under our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| So unless someone tells me that we can't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| my amendment would be to make the contract end October 28, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| and for us to revisit it at that time if there were the option of amending compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| And it gives us time to find out what statements and things that we can make on the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| being able to not communicate with their families without having to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| and no in-person contact with family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| I do want to ask the law director to comment on the issue of one year versus two on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| This is a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| This is a resolution that authorizes us to enter into a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| It's a contract that is previously negotiated between two parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| so it would not be appropriate for we don't have the capacity to tell Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| they have to enter into a contract that's only one year instead of two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| We don't have that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| So, I mean, there are some other things we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| We could go back and look at it and negotiate with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| and find out whether they would be willing to negotiate a different contract than this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| but we cannot amend this contract by virtue of an amendment to this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| to say that the contract will be different because this is the contract that has been negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| So all this resolution does is authorize the mayor to enter into that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| So really council's ability at this point is either to authorize that contract or not authorize that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4790)|
| 1:19:59| But you can't draft the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| I said, but you can't draft the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| You know, I think I'm very sensitive to these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| and I think a lot of the speakers raised some very important points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| a lot of which I think that's what's been expressed are outside of sort of the purview of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| But I guess I had a question for Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| In terms of how many days or man hours or man days, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4827)|
| 1:20:35| how big is this for the city in terms of what we're sort of receiving out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| Is this a few projects here and there at private property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| Are we really supplementing our workforce with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| I mean, I think in the grand scheme of the number of work orders that the Public Works Department completes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| this is a relatively small percentage of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| The projects that we complete, many of them are projects that there is a community benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| but the use of our city resources is either so low on the priority list that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| like Kudzu removal in a certain area where someone doesn't have resources to do Kudzu removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| like there's a community good for that, but we need to clean out stormwater pipes and pick up brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| It just prioritizes down very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| But these community projects, especially the cemeteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| there are a number of abandoned cemeteries in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| and I think those are very important sites when I think of the Odd Fellows Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| which is really the historic African-American cemetery in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| What that used to be and what it is now, it's truly an amenity for that community, and it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4910)|
| 1:21:58| And so those are projects that this inmate crew, so day-to-day city operations, no, you won't feel any impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4918)|
| 1:22:07| but these small projects that we really don't, we don't have the ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| and again, a nonprofit perhaps needs their carpet removed because it got flooded during a storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| The city's not going to go in with our resources unless we have a contract approved by city council to remove carpet or do demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4939)|
| 1:22:27| The inmate crew can do community good, can do that type of work on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| and that has been the greatest benefit for us, which is to meet the needs of property that is private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| but essentially abandoned and doesn't fit into our codes program very easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| or low to moderate income nonprofits, small nonprofits, or community members that have a need, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| where we don't necessarily want to go out from a code standpoint and take corrective action and bill that owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| We can go in with the inmate crew, clean up a hoarder's house, clean a backyard, remove invasive species,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| and again, these are things that there will be a visible impact if we do not continue the program because of the sites that I've just named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| and I think exploring the idea of the compensation is something completely willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=4993)|
| 1:23:21| and I think Mayor O'Hara would ask about that previously in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| Right, well, I'm just sitting here torn because I think some good issues have been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| but at the same time, I think there's a lot of benefit to this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| and I'd be curious to talk to some of the participants in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| I guess just thinking if I had a 180-day sentence myself, I would probably like that to go out and work and get it cut down to 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5019)|
| 1:23:48| I think that, to me, seems something, if you think about it from the point of view of the participants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5028)|
| 1:23:59| that they would certainly support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| I could talk with the public defender's office, but it still seems, I mean we're two weeks later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5044)|
| 1:24:12| but it still seems like there's quite a bit of discomfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| I don't know if we want to be willing to make a motion to postpone it for four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5054)|
| 1:24:23| or we could explore some of these issues and dive deeper in terms of sort of the numbers behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| and if we don't approve it, what exactly would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| Would the program just end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| No, I mean, I believe what would happen is, if we don't have this lease, is that the sheriff program will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| We won't have engagement as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| and they will not do the projects that we have need for that come in, again, from community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| and neighborhood groups throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| So, again, I think engagement in the program has been beneficial for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5096)|
| 1:25:06| I think the city's approach to engaging with the inmates has been positive with personal protective equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5106)|
| 1:25:13| and with good meals, and obviously, you know, one thing that Chad manages that Mayor O'Hara helped create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5113)|
| 1:25:21| is a second chances program where we try to build relationships with people that are incarcerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| and we try to bring them into our second chances program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| It's an employment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Employment program, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| If you've been incarcerated, you go through a nonprofit organization that assists you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| and then you come in and work with the city public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| So I think there's been positive benefit for the program and the relationship with the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| but obviously we'll do what council would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| Council, let me just say something here for a second, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| So I want to thank Julie, really, for two weeks ago coming and raising this issue, and everybody coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| It's because of those issues that I asked council to postpone this so we could start digging in a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| and thank you for all the time you've taken, Julie, for subsequent conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| You all have raised some really important questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Some of it has been said much larger than what we can solve around the table here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| but questions that I think everyone around this table probably agrees with are also questions in terms of our prison system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| and in terms of some of the things that our prisoners here in Knox County face in terms of video visits and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5190)|
| 1:26:40| So I've really struggled with this, and some of it has already been mentioned by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| is that there are people that are utilizing this program now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5206)|
| 1:26:53| and from our experience in working with them, they are volunteering, they are getting time off their sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5213)|
| 1:27:02| they are getting out of that facility, and we have not perceived, picked up through this process, that it is a negative impact on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5222)|
| 1:27:11| There are still many negative impacts being in jail that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| but we have never had that impression from our crews that work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| So we are very willing, I'm very willing, our team is very willing to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| and to talk to the sheriff about whether there are ways that individuals are not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| my lawyer tells me there's a lot of issues with, you know, the way this can work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| but to be able to go back and talk about if there's some way to recognize the labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| whether it's payment or something in lieu of, that actually benefits them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| We are very willing to do that. I pledge to you that we are willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| But I would caution about postponing or denying this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| because you're taking away that ability for those who do volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| and are knocking off some time on their sentences and are availing of the opportunity, as little as it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| I don't want to deny them that opportunity now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| So if we go ahead and pass this tonight, we can still continue to work on this issue and raise it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| and see if there's not some way we can better compensate those folks who work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5300)|
| 1:28:29| So that's what I would ask, and a few council members have stated that already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| but I just wanted to say from the administration that we will continue this conversation with the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| to see if there's a better way that we can do this to better compensate those who volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5321)|
| 1:28:48| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Swanson, is there a way, instead of postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| if we vote this down, then the contract can be renegotiated immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| and we can start talking to them about compensation or things that the city will do to compensate them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5342)|
| 1:29:10| Your authority is to either authorize the mayor to execute the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| or not authorize the mayor to execute the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| It will then be a decision for the mayor to decide what to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| if you decide not to authorize this contract to be entered into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| and a component of that is Knox County willing to engage in further negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5367)|
| 1:29:35| after receiving that message that they will receive from not being authorized to enter into the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| And I can't answer that question without, you know, somebody from the county answering that question for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5381)|
| 1:29:51| Both Mayor and Councilwoman Ryder have mentioned that there are not a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| that we have power and control over on a city level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| but when we get something in front of us that we do have some power to make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| I think this is when we're supposed to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| This is a very small sliver of what the mass incarceration piece looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| and it's the only sliver that we have control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| On a local level, this is something that we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| and I think it sends a message to a lot of people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| there's a whole strata of society that their lives are going in and out of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| and paying for their jail time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| I don't want to be a part of that. I don't want the city to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| I'm hoping that the Sheriff's Department does not end the program because I see the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| I know that there are benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| When you have the choice between staying in a cell or working outdoors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| I'm sure everyone chooses working outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| But I just don't think that we don't need to be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5452)|
| 1:31:01| Thank you, Mayor. I would call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| Okay, there is a call for a question. We will vote on that. It's not debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| This is to end debate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| This is to end debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| This is to end debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| This was just, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| This is a call for the question. That means we're ending the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| Okay, and we're then going to go vote on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Sorry, that was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| So we're voting on if your light's on, you don't get to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| That's a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| You guys didn't do that in eight years before I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| We do it occasionally when there's been a long discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| Well, when there's a call for the question, we have to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| You can vote yes or no, but this is a call for the question to end debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Okay, so if you want to end debate now, vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| I guess I'm the only one that has their light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| I mean, I was just going to, I mean, it's just, it's a torture thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| Now let me get to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| You can speak to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Now we're on the motion to approve the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| I'll call on Councilman Serra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| I would just think I was just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Now we have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| I think there's a lot of good things about the program as well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| and I heard Councilmember Singh-Perez say that she was in favor of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| but she was voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| And so, anyway, it's just a, it's a convoluted vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| I mean, I'm forced to vote on it, and I'll vote in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| because I do think there are a lot of benefits of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| just like in 100% agreement with Councilmember Singh-Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| that there's a lot of benefit for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| And so I think it has flaws and look forward to working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| Okay, so I'm a failure at parliamentary procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| I should have allowed him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Thanks for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| I failed at that, so the law director made it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Okay, so now this is, now we are voting on the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| We'll do roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5602)|

| 1:33:34| Councilman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| The motion passes 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Again, as we said, we will continue this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| Thank you all for the issues you raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| It won't stop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| Zaxter Incorporated to design, implement, own, operate, maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5637)|

| 1:34:08| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5651)|

| 1:35:05| not to exceed $180,304, which includes a 25% match from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5705)|
| 1:35:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| I also have an amendment, which everybody has at their...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| Okay, first let's get a motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| And now we have the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| So now the amended motion is the one you have in your hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| which essentially increases the amount to $288,488.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| But we need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Okay, I need a second on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Now is there any discussion about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| We will vote on adding the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| and then we'll vote on the original resolution as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| I'm getting this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Okay, so this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| We have a motion and a second to amend with the information before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| The amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| We're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| And we do have a first and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| So we have a light on, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| Chief Thomas, most of this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| I was looking at where the funds are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| It's not placing more officers in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| It does not pay for officers in the school, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| It's mostly a pass-through grant that we had to apply for Knox County schools to use for their school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Some of our SROs will receive some training as a part of this, but only a small part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Okay, so we have a motion and a second on the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| 12A is an ordinance approving an amendment to the Southwest County Sector Plan from low-density residential to general commercial for property located on the southeast side of Westland Drive, northeast side of I-140, LeConte Holdings, LLC, Applicant 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5816)|
| 1:37:16| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| We have speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Would you like to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| All right, so let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| We have two people here to speak for it and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I'm going to go with the fours first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| I messed that up last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| Okay, Mr. King and Mr. Preston Smith, both of you, I'll call on you in that order if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5853)|
| 1:37:43| Mr. King, did you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| All right, we'll get your stuff out of your briefcase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| I need to abstain on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| You want to state that for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Just before they get going, of course, I work with Mr. King, so I'll need to abstain on these three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| I didn't hear that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| Mr. King, please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| John King, 620 Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| Since there are actually three items, and my comments are going to relate to all of them, rather than me speak separately on each item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5905)|
| 1:38:36| if I could get a little bit of indulgence on the five minutes, I'd rather just speak about them all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5916)|
| 1:38:44| Counsel, is there agreement to amend the rules to allow him to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| As long as we do it for both sides, I think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| How much time are you taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| I need to abstain on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| I haven't timed myself on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Well, how about we say no more than ten minutes, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| That gives you two out of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Please go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Five and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Actually, Councilman Wallace said, how about five and a half minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| So maybe I was too generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| But go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Like the judge told me one time when I asked how long I had to argue something, he said, take as long as you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| I quit listening after three and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| You might find the same here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| I know that all of you have received a number of e-mails from us, as well as our opponents, outlining the background of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5968)|
| 1:39:40| This is back to you from MPC after having been sent there for another look, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5980)|
| 1:39:49| And after two reviews and action by MPC, we're here on MPC recommendations for amending both of the plans involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=5989)|
| 1:40:01| in approving rezoning of this property to C4, which permits us to pursue our proposal for a self-storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6001)|
| 1:40:12| which is the same use our next-door neighbor that adjoins us is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6012)|
| 1:40:23| And that same neighbor adjoins the property of Ms. Boyce and Mr. Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6023)|
| 1:40:33| Our proposed development does not adjoin any residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| And as noted, that's the development, does not adjoin any residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| And as noted by MPC staff in its report on the last occasion they looked at this, it is in an ideal location for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6048)|
| 1:41:01| In discussions and meetings with our opponents, some of those discussions that took place involving Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6061)|
| 1:41:16| we have stressed our interest in developing a self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| We've advised that we were willing to deed-restrict that portion of our property to eliminate a number of possible uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6083)|
| 1:41:33| if that was of real interest to pursue by us and then the willingness of our opponents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6093)|
| 1:41:46| We, in essence, voluntarily suggested that we would agree or were willing to agree to a number of proposed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6106)|
| 1:42:01| as to use, eliminating certain uses, if that would result in an end to their opposition to this rezoning and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6121)|
| 1:42:17| And moments before this body's last meeting, we were told that they, our opponents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6137)|
| 1:42:25| were unwilling to do that despite our having provided a list of things we were willing to prohibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6145)|
| 1:42:36| MPC says an office zoning classification doesn't work because it's contrary to the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6156)|
| 1:42:48| and the plans just recently made by County Commission in dealing with the request and proposal of the adjoining neighbor that I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6168)|
| 1:43:07| That's the Craig Allen property, for those of you who may remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6187)|
| 1:43:16| We also have provided information from two individuals, one a real estate person and one being Land Development Solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6196)|
| 1:43:32| that briefly summarized why it is that an office classification doesn't really work for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6212)|
| 1:43:43| Under the circumstances where we are, it seems unfair to leave this property owner captive to his opponents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6223)|
| 1:43:57| who have already supported the same use that he wants to do on property adjoining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6237)|
| 1:44:08| We've been more than fair in our attempts to reach an agreement on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6248)|
| 1:44:15| and we've worked hard on it and over a number of occasions, but we have been unable to reach resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6255)|
| 1:44:27| I submit that it's not a rational expectation that one property owner should dictate what another can do with his or her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6267)|
| 1:44:39| I'm leaving out a lot of additional explanation because I know you all have been getting information back and forth about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6279)|
| 1:44:54| Our prior attempts to resolve the opposition have been unsuccessful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| and nothing that we have expressed a willingness to do is acceptable to our opponents so as to resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6301)|
| 1:45:10| I guess that leaves us, since we can't get their support or at least their non-opposition to our rezoning and development request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6310)|
| 1:45:28| we have asked that we go back to where MPC was and approve a request for the plan amendments and rezoning this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6328)|
| 1:45:45| to C-4 with the attached two conditions that they put on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| one of them being use on reviews required for any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| and the other one had to do with what standard for landscaping was going to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6356)|
| 1:46:09| I know that a member or members of council have expressed interest in certain uses as perhaps not being appropriate for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6369)|
| 1:46:22| There is or at least was a belief that we, being us and our opponents, have agreed to a couple of restrictions on use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6382)|
| 1:46:36| I'm told that we really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| We don't have an agreement to cease opposition by attempted deed restrictions insofar as they have expressed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6400)|
| 1:46:55| We still want to develop our property that we've owned for somewhere in the range of about 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6415)|
| 1:47:04| Mr. Smith wants to develop it for a use that the opponents supported for property adjoining theirs and ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6424)|
| 1:47:20| I say all that to get to the point by saying to you tonight that keeping in mind those council expressed concerns or interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6440)|
| 1:47:33| I say that if the property is rezoned C-4 with the two conditions attached by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6453)|
| 1:47:45| we will declare and record deed restrictions on that rezoned property prohibiting certain uses, and they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6465)|
| 1:47:57| no outdoor storage services or unenclosed storage service for automobiles, boats, trailers, RV, off-road type vehicles, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6477)|
| 1:48:10| And no drive-in window commercial uses for servicing food and beverage service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6490)|
| 1:48:20| Those restrictions would be for a period of 10 years after which they automatically terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| The restrictions that I mentioned don't require our opponents' agreement or involvement at all to so terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6508)|
| 1:48:45| Having failed in the effort to get it done by agreement between the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6525)|
| 1:48:53| I'm asking and we ask that City Council approve the rezoning request and the two plan amendments and rezone this property, property C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6533)|
| 1:49:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Next is Mr. Smith, Preston Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Sir, I'm going to hold you to the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Could you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| Preston Smith, 7011 Lawford Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| Mine will be much less than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| I'll just defer my time, and my letter that I sent to all the council people, I think the two pages or whatever pretty much states my feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6567)|
| 1:49:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| Mr. Klein, by rights, there are three different issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| We gave Mr. King time to talk about all of them, so likewise, you can have up to 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| Three times five is 15, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Well, I didn't do it fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| He only got two out of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| You only get two out of three, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| I won't take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| It's a pleasure to be here before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| My name is Wayne Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| My address is 617 Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| I'm in the firm of Hodges, Dowdy, and Carson, and I'm here on behalf of the neighborhood that extends from Ebenezer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6609)|
| 1:50:17| which has been underwater for a few days and still is partly, down to North Shore Drive on Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| I also am here representing Tremor Village, the village of condominiums that's immediately adjacent to where this area is being requested for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6624)|
| 1:50:35| We have some folks here from Tremor Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| Are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| Thank you for showing, and you also have a letter from Patricia Mayhew from Tremor Village in your stack of papers that has been received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6639)|
| 1:50:51| and she is in opposition to this request, and she speaks on behalf of the community just east of this requested property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6651)|
| 1:51:03| This is not a request for a self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| This is a request for a rezoning of the property and a change in the one-year plan and a change in the southwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6669)|
| 1:51:19| This is not just for a self-storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| negotiations, settlement discussions, and a variety of fronts, including a very long conversation with Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6684)|
| 1:51:35| and we did come to a point where we thought before the last meeting we had a settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6695)|
| 1:51:42| but in the end, contrary to what Mr. King would have you believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| we were asked to withdraw all opposition to any C-4 use in this property if they would agree to two restrictive covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6707)|
| 1:52:05| We have always been about the intense commercial nature of this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6725)|
| 1:52:14| It is not a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| Mr. Smith's letter would exclude a few uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| Mr. King said they would enter into restrictive covenants and record them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| Folks, you don't have anything to do with restrictive covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| That's not your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| Restrictive covenants usually come before this meeting, not after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| There's nothing for us as a neighborhood, as neighbors, to enforce because there are no restrictive covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6757)|
| 1:52:46| What I was told before the last meeting was everything is off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| We're back to talking about C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| C-4 is a zone that permits outside storage, display of merchandise, material, and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6775)|
| 1:53:05| We're at the corner of Westland Drive and I-140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| Across the street from our proposed change here is the Shoreline Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6791)|
| 1:53:21| Morning Point, and Assisted Living Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Both are low-impact uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| Both we negotiated so they would be low-impact uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| Across the street to the west is the Children's Hospital, whom we negotiated with 20-some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6813)|
| 1:53:41| Instead of a strip mall, we've got a Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| We're very proud of our neighborhood and we're very proud of what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| Both of those places across from Westland Drive, the Morning Point and the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| have access from Emory Church Road as well as Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| This particular site has only access from Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| It is a C-shaped remnant of the construction of the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| The Pellissippi Parkway-Westland Drive interchange is a diamond interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| While most of Westland Drive's from Ebenezer Road to Pellissippi Parkway has turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| this section in front of this property, immediately east of Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| is limited to two lanes because of West Emory Presbyterian Church Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| So you're going to have a traffic problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| And I don't need to go into detail about the traffic problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| We did talk about our problems with this in letters of November 1, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| which were sent to all of you, as well as a second letter on January 10, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| which you have in your packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| Knox County Commission did not approve any commercial zoning fronting on Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6892)|
| 1:55:00| on the property east of this, which has been called another property in the county for Craig Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6900)|
| 1:55:10| His property fronting Westland Drive is office zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| And you get to the commercial zone, which is in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| which has and had restrictive covenants on it before it was ever brought before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6917)|
| 1:55:25| And the purpose of this whole filing is for a carte blanche C-4 commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6925)|
| 1:55:38| I'll never even remind you that city council, and I don't appear before you often because we live out in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6938)|
| 1:55:44| but city council's general description of C-4 talks about the intent of this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6944)|
| 1:55:52| is to provide appropriate space and sufficient depth from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| to satisfy the needs of modern commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| where access is entirely dependent on motor vehicle trade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| to provide the orderly development and concentration of highway and arterial commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| at appropriate locations and to encourage the development of these locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| with such uses and in such a manner as to minimize traffic hazards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| and interference with other uses in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| That's not what's going to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| You're going to have a huge traffic problem right here because it's in between two traffic lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| one at Emory Church and one at Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| and also there is no ability for a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| C-4 uses include any sort of retail establishment, eating, drinking establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| automobile service and repair establishment, including gas stations, tire recapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| hotels, motels, kennels, drive-in commercial uses, new and used car and truck sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| and the list goes on, and it also includes C-3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| This proposal before you tonight does not address deed restrictions as to height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7021)|
| 1:57:08| lighting, stream buffers, landscaping, lot coverage, signs, fencing and design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| That's why we started talking in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| This is what the neighbors who have to live in this area want to keep from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| When Billy Weigel put his Weigels in at this, which is the only commercial use that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| I negotiated with Billy Weigel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| We're very proud of the Weigel store because it has lights that are low in whatever it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| incandescence, that point down, and the whole area is not lit up at night because of the lights at the Weigels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7056)|
| 1:57:45| which is open, by the way, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| So we believe Preston Smith's property should be an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| Contrary to what Mr. King said in his delivery, our position is that there are a large number of uses in an office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7075)|
| 1:58:10| which would not destroy Mr. Preston's property, and so we're asking you to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| By the way, I want to talk about his letters that he put in from Land Development Solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| It talks about shape, setbacks and stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| Those are the limitations of his property, and also the Cornerstone Real Estate Association letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7105)|
| 1:58:32| talks about market trends for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| There is use for an office out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| It would be appropriate to be an office, but it is inappropriate for general commercial in a C4 city zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| and I have a minute left, and I want to get you out of here as fast as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| Thank you, sir. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| All right, Council, that's the end of the public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| I see that Amy Brooks is here for the Planning Commission for us, so let me just ask you a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7139)|
| 1:59:08| It was my understanding that when the Planning Commissioners reviewed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| they were concerned about the appropriateness of all C4 uses on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| and therefore required that all C4 uses go through use on review approval. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| My concern with this from when we began this discussion a while back was that some of the C4 uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7164)|
| 1:59:31| including and drive-through windows for commercial use involving food and beverage sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| seems inappropriate to me, which I know we've talked about here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| Would these uses need to be approved by Planning Commissioners in a public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| The uses would not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| The site design, we would look at the impacts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| We would make recommendations associated with that, but we wouldn't necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| We wouldn't be able to restrict the uses per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| Would the neighborhood be able to express their concerns about these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| and if either party was unsatisfied, come back to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| I don't know if anyone else has any comments on this, but I'm prepared to make a motion if you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| I'll second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| Having reviewed the record, I agree with the Planning Commission, and therefore I move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| We have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Well, I want to approve this, but, I mean, without any restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| it just opens the table in the future to unknown uses, even if it's after 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| It would be, gosh, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| Just without having any controls over it, I can't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7250)|

| 2:01:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7318)|

| 2:02:05| Okay, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| So that's the end of the agenda for you to vote on, but we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| We have four people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| Ms. Scheib, are you still signed up for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| So we have three people signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| The first is William Eisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Mr. Eisen, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7344)|
| 2:02:30| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Thank you for sitting out the whole time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| you keep an eye on the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| My name is William Eisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| I live at 4600 Skyline Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| Y'all doing okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| This is boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| I ain't coming back to these things ever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| What do you mean boring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| This was one of our exciting ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| Call it whatever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| Teach their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| So for the past or last year, all of last year, me and a group of kind of computer programmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7382)|
| 2:03:11| and network engineers and just basically nerds kind of got together and started gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| information and data in support of a public broadband project for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| And I understand and we understand that the city council defers to KUB for KUB business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| So we delivered the same amount of information to KUB last week, and we just wanted to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7408)|
| 2:03:37| it to you guys too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| And so what we're also doing, we'll be back, we, it's just me and Adam, but we'll be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| next month with a report also that has the data that we've compiled in it also from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7424)|
| 2:03:51| region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| But this is really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| We passed around a petition asking residents if Knoxville Utility Board offered high speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7434)|
| 2:04:05| internet or broadband, I would subscribe to those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| And basically people just gave their name and their zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| And we got about 300 signatures here because we all have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| We don't have time to like sit around and do this all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| But we wanted to just ask our, the people in our neighborhoods what, you know, if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7460)|
| 2:04:27| is something that they would be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| And overwhelmingly people were like, yeah, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| We have a heat map that we produced from the zip codes on the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| And it looks like, and this is not Charles Periphery, but most of the people that responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7478)|
| 2:04:46| to this were in, still in KUB's footprint in Granger County, Washburn, Luttrell, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7486)|
| 2:04:58| Maynardville in Union County, which is not also not where you guys do business, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| South Knoxville had a huge response to this because a lot of residents only have one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| Either have Comcast or AT&T and very rarely do those footprints overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| And so as we've seen in basically every county east of Knoxville, public utilities and electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7515)|
| 2:05:26| cooperatives are engaging in some form of public broadband option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| Jefferson County to Bristol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| Bristol's deploying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Johnson City's deploying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| All of Cocke County is wiring, their public utility is wiring the county with broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7537)|
| 2:05:45| Greene County, the only places that aren't doing it are Hancock County and Claiborne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| County because they're partnering with a, and half of Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| The half of Union County that's not served by KUB is partnering with a private provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| Sunset Digital Ladder, Duffield, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| So anyways, Knoxville, I live in Knoxville, and it would be great if we had a public broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7564)|
| 2:06:10| option here, the same as in Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| Jefferson County's figuring out how to deploy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| So Lenore City, so Farragut's going to have public broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Knoxville's going to get left behind in this basic utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| And one other thing, we've got two letters of support for this from Lindbergh Forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| Neighborhood Association and Burlington Residents Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| These letters basically say they want KUB to do a feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| And I think, you know, people can say they want anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| People can say that they want a unicorn, but the thing that's more realistic is the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| or some kind of entity do a feasibility study so we know what the opportunities and obstacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| are for broadband provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| And I don't know what I do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7620)|

| 2:07:04| You can pass it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| And Mr. Brace will take it from Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| Ms. Hughes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7637)|
| 2:07:25| Ms. Hughes, please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| My name is Adam Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| I live 1119 Alexander Street, Apartment 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| Thank you so much for the opportunity to address the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| My name is Adam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| I'm a member of Statewide Organizing for Community Empowerment, or SOCHM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| Last year, SOCHM partnered with members of the SEED Task Force and other public advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7666)|
| 2:07:51| to collect information about the need for a public Internet option in the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| Utility Board Service Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| We did this because many of our members have had problems maintaining reliable, affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| access, in large part because of the effective monopoly power that providers exercise in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7682)|
| 2:08:08| many Knoxville neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Through our outreach efforts, tablings, meetings with neighborhood associations, addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| community organizations, I never spoke with a single person who was not supportive of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| a public broadband option, and this was a consensus that cut across political and demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| I've read the 2013 KUB White Paper that explains why they have not chosen to follow the lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| of cities like Chattanooga in establishing a public option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| I understand their arguments, but just six years later, we're living in a drastically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| different regulatory, technological, and social environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| More and more, Knoxville is getting left behind neighbors like Morristown, Newport, Athens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| and the over 800 communities in the United States that have adopted public telecom networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| The fundraising and cost issues that KUB cites are still significant, but the funding available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| for technology upgrades is ample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| I urge this council to work with KUB to come up with creative ways to finance this important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| infrastructure investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| In addition, the White Paper neglects to mention the substantial savings that come to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| systems, libraries, and other municipal institutions when they are preserved from the inevitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| price increases from private providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| Documented savings in communities smaller than Knoxville have been tens of millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| We also need to understand that public networks throughout Tennessee have been shown over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7775)|
| 2:09:42| the past decade to dramatically be able to increase their service speeds without raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| prices, which is very much unique to the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| KUB, while producing this White Paper, has never done a thorough customer satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| survey to see if people, despite having on paper a number of options, if they in practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| have that many options and if they are satisfied with the options available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| I would say that that should be part of a thorough feasibility study that city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| could work on with KUB as step one of the process to establishing a public broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| Finally, I want to mention that Sockum has a long history, a 47-year history right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7821)|
| 2:10:28| of working on coal mining issues here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| And I've been reflecting today on the connection that the coal industry has had with the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| of the prison labor in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| After the Civil War, many mines established contracting with the state, prison labor programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7843)|
| 2:10:49| that became so popular that it actually led to a demand for more prisoners and a dramatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7849)|
| 2:10:55| increase in the carceral state, what we now know as Jim Crow laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| It was only after the workers whose coal mining jobs were being lost to this program rose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7859)|
| 2:11:04| up in what's now known as the Coal Creek War that Tennessee became the first state in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| south to eliminate a state-sponsored convict labor program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| I think about how, I don't know, how compressed history can seem sometime and yet how its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7874)|
| 2:11:23| judgments can also seem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| And I really hope that the council follows through from their stated claim tonight to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7884)|
| 2:11:30| begin working on a program of compensation for the prison laborers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| And I also ask that even if this takes six months or a year to figure out, you begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| now calculating the time that laborers are working and consider any work they do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| to be paid in arrears once you establish this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| Last but not least, Officer Keith Lyon, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| I'm Keith Lyon, President of Fraternal Water Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| I come before you today to help us not just in the area of boosting our recruitment but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| also our retention and also our competitiveness in the job market at the Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| It's no secret that recruitment is down 75% nationwide in new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| In the 1990s, it wasn't hard for us here locally to have 2,000 to 3,000 applicants a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| My class had 3,000 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| It was no problem when an officer left the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| He or she was easily replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| Times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| Governments seek qualified college graduates for this job and as well as they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7958)|
| 2:12:43| But now many people in this day and age are wondering why it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| That's a discussion for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| But today, a college graduate thinks, I've spent over $40,000 for a college degree, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| this type of job isn't worth it for the money that's paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| Our salaries don't even start at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| Today, we don't get 3,000 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| Our current academy class is only a third full because it's hard to get people to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| our standards out of a pool of only 180 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| We take what we can but just understand we have a problem here and the answer isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| lowering standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| We have a great reputation here at the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| In the area of retention, understand Knoxville Police Department academy graduate carries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| a lot of weight with other law enforcement agencies across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| Out of this last class, one trainee hadn't even completed the FTO program and already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| got a federal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| An officer can apply for another agency and be virtually guaranteed to get hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| Understand that law enforcement agencies across the country and the globe come here to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8028)|
| 2:13:54| how we do business and everything from a parking ticket to riot control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| That started in 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8038)|
| 2:14:05| That's quite a reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| It gets harder and harder to hold on to that reputation when the department is understaffed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| and the needs keep growing because the area is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| Of course, everybody is familiar with the needs in the drug abuse locally and what heroin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8054)|
| 2:14:20| is doing to the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| That's more work for the police officers to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| Also, police officers these days are considered to be a clearinghouse for mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| It's quite a burden to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| A good economy should mean investing more in police department personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| Less than a third of each academy class actually retires from the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| My academy class was 35 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| There's only 11 of us left because they take their certificate and go to other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8084)|
| 2:14:49| that pay better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| I ask you to help take a step in helping us compete in the law enforcement job market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| It's simple, supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| We don't compete with just agencies our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| We're competing with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| We hire from the entire nation and not just from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| Our last class has one as far away as from California and also Chicago, Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| These agencies recognize when the supply is low and the demand is up, so is the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| These agencies were posting salaries ranging from $40,000 to $50,000 this past year in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8119)|
| 2:15:27| Fifteen of those agencies posted at $50,000 and four of those at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| It's hard to compete with that in a $30,000 range starting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| In the area of lateral transfers, five agencies posted notices that they will start an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| with 12 years' experience at $72,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| It's hard to compete with that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| There is a migration of veteran officers, which is far more likely going to be hired in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| As of 2018, 475 officers of the Los Angeles Police Department have applied for positions in other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8154)|
| 2:16:01| and most of them are in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| One hundred and four officers left Seattle Police Department to be hired elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| Fifty-five of those officers also came to the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| Atlanta is phasing in a 33% raise for police officers over a four-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8173)|
| 2:16:18| in order to retain their experienced officers in their department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| They see the need. They see that this is supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| This is job market conditions we're competing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8186)|
| 2:16:29| We ask you to take a large step in helping us stay competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190226?start=8189)|
