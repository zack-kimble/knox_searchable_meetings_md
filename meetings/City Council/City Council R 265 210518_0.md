| 0:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Well, moving right along to the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| First, you may have noticed I'm not wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| And this is a little odd feeling, I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| But I have always followed and encouraged the people of the city of Knoxville to follow the science and follow the CDC guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=212)|
| 0:03:41| And the CDC has updated its guidelines and said that people who are fully vaccinated can feel safe not wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| And I'm choosing not to wear a mask tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| I feel comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| I will, of course, keep my mask handy because there are many businesses and situations where I might feel more comfortable wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| So, anyhow, just wanted to say that I think this is really good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| Our community is getting vaccinated in high numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| We need to keep working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| And I encourage everyone to get vaccinated and talk to your doctor if you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| I also wanted to say thanks for everyone who is here tonight in person or watching remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| We welcome those here both to witness and to provide input concerning the discussions and decisions that council will be making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| We have a lot of business to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| And I want to ensure that the expectations for this evening are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item or during public forum should sign up with the city recorder ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| If you are speaking in favor or against a specific agenda item, you will be expected to stay on topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| and all discussion should speak directly to the agenda item and to the decision-facing council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| Broader comments not specific to the agenda item at hand may be stated by those signed up for public forum at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| Speakers should not use profanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| If speakers fail to adhere to those rules, I will rule you out of order and ask you to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| For those who are listening, please note that there are also rules against disrupting a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| This includes making loud noises or adding additional comments when you are not the designated speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| Passion in politics is understandable, and I am a supporter of free speech and of the right to assemble and the right to peacefully protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| But it is unacceptable to impede the ability of council members to have meaningful discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| or to keep fellow audience members from hearing what council is here tonight to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Those who do disrupt this meeting by violating the rules, whether as a speaker or as an observer, will be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| I appreciate in advance everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| Thank you for your help in ensuring everyone here today can participate and observe the meeting peacefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| So now, on to some other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| As you all know, we are inching close to summer break for area students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| and keeping our young people engaged in safe and enriching programs is a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| At the same time, we know many face barriers that keep them from taking part in the programs that our many youth-serving organizations offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| We want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| The City has just released a new mini-grant program to assist local nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| in reaching the young people who need their programs the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| These grants, which can range from $3,000 to $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| are specifically for youth programming and support to be carried out between June and September of this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| This is a competitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Some applications may not be funded, and some may be only partially funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Applications must be received by 4.30 p.m. Tuesday, June 1, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=405)|

| 0:07:00| and it's a great time for all of us to publicly thank the people who work day in and day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| often behind the scenes, to keep our City running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| All week we will be sharing stories about the men and women from various departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| who are responsible for things we often take for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Today's post features Joe Collins, the City's Public Service Department foreman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| whose crew did the recent landscaping on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Some of those beds can be quite a challenge, as they are often walked through by visitors to the Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Collins' crew recently laid sod, built new beds, and added additional plants and flowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| So next time you're downtown, take note of how spruced up the area looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| Also be sure to check out our Public Service Week series on the City's Facebook page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| And finally, Council, I believe you've already been in touch with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| about their plans to request permission from the City to offer broadband Internet service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| in its current customer service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| This is something I've been very supportive of, and Council has too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| High-quality, affordable, reliable Internet is just as critical to the people of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| and businesses as electricity, water, and wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| I am really grateful to KUB for their leadership in pursuing this public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=489)|

| 0:08:59| recognizing the Junior League's 100th birthday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=539)|

| 0:09:08| I'm getting ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| For those of you that don't know, the Junior League was the extension of the Girls Relief Corps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| which worked in World War I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=556)|

| 0:09:22| and just a quick update of some of the things that they worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| In 1960 was the first Dogwood Arts Festival Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=567)|

| 0:09:41| and recently they've been involved in domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| They often work quietly behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Our community is lucky to have a group of women who, for 100 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=587)|

| 0:10:01| I just wanted to briefly just point out to everyone that the American Job Center of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| is having a summer youth program for work experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| It's opportunities available for those who are 17 to 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| to gain work experience and career skills this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| This program, individuals can connect with area employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| and earn up to $4,000 over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| The program is funded under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| and sponsored by the American Job Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| in the East Tennessee Local Workforce Development Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| I encourage everyone to please contact the American Job Center for more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| I will have this posted on Facebook as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| But Courtney Woolard is a youth career specialist who is one of the contacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| as well as Lucas Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| And so just to encourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| I want to make sure that people know about opportunities for young people this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| so they will have some productive things to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| and be able to earn some skills and money as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Okay, seeing no reports, we'll move on to Item 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| Item 8A is a resolution appointing Councilmember Amelia Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| to serve on the Board of the Directors of the Community Television of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=668)|

| 0:11:16| I just want to speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| thank you, Ms. Parker, for accepting this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=679)|

| 0:11:25| But it brings to mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| I think the city needs to have an ethics clause in our contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| It's something that's been missing in other situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| and it's something that I feel is missing in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| So it's something I'd like to see the city work on in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| There needs to be an ethics clause with who we do business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=707)|

| 0:13:51| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| My name is Phyllis Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| I'm with the Knoxville Area Urban League, 1514 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| I want to thank Mayor Ken Cannon and Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| and council members for allowing us the opportunity to voice support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| for the mayor's proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| The Urban League respects all people and their contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| and we actively work to serve and engage individuals from various backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| with different viewpoints, advocacy efforts, skills, and talents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| To be brief, I will tell you the points of the mayor's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| which I think aligns with the work that our organization has been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| in this community for 54 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| We believe an individual and family that are self-sufficient is the goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| to having a strong, viable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| And when we think that the Urban League has been a HUD-certified housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| counseling agency since 1974, affordable housing is an annual concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| for not only the people that come to us, but our growth as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| We are supportive of what the mayor has invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| and allowed in her budget for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| We know that this is just the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| because we can't solve this crucial community problem in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| but we have to start someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| And we know that it doesn't have all the money we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| And again, I say we are supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| It also is a longer-term commitment because we know that that's what's going to be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| to solve the housing problem here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=941)|
| 0:15:49| Secondly, we'd like to say that we are very supportive that the mayor's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| has included an investment in the Burlington community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| a vibrant community at one time that now has been historically overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| And so the resources to bring this community vibrant again for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| and the people who live in that area is long needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| and we thank the mayor and council for considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| I also want to speak on behalf of a lot of people, because only three could be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| for the support in the mayor's budget for nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Nonprofits are the safety net for our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| We do things that the government cannot and should not do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| but we cannot do that alone without some type of support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| because we contribute to the betterment of lives for all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| And so on behalf of my fellow nonprofit members, we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| And then another piece that I think that I need to bring is for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| the Urban League has been engaged in entrepreneurship and small business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| And we have been working with a few partners, but what we see now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| and a request that we have had over multiple administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| is a disparity study for the economic assessment here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| to see where are disparities for the growth in minority businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| And so we want to thank the mayor for including in the budget support for an economic disparity study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| which will not only help us to grow minority businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| but it will make Knoxville more appealing to folks who want to come here to start business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| So in conclusion, affordable housing, investment in the Burlington community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| and to support an economic development study, and support to nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| are primarily the areas on which I am here to endorse the mayor's proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Thank you, Ms. Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| The next person signed up to speak in favor is Ms. Claudia Caballero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| Ms. Caballero, you can come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| My name is Claudia Caballero, and I am Centro Hispano's CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Our address is 2455 Sutherland Avenue, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| Centro Hispano's mission is to connect, integrate, and empower the Latino community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| through educational programs, workforce development, culturally relevant Spanish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| referral services, and community engagement initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| I'd like to thank the city for considering support of Centro Hispano's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Educacion al Emprendedor entrepreneurial training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| The proposed funding would allow Centro Hispano to offer the only Spanish-language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| small business training program in Knoxville and surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| Our city is considered a recent Latino destination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| since the population grew over 150% from 2000 to 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| We expect the recent census data to show even greater increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| in the Latino community members in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Alongside this demographic increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Latino-owned businesses are also growing at a rapid rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| Since 1996, the Latino business ownership in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| has more than doubled from 6% to 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| Although Latinos are currently 18% of the population in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| we now own 24% of new startups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Here in Knox County, between 2007 and 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| total sales of Latino-owned businesses increased over 95%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| Although Latinos are increasing and running businesses at impressive rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| Latino-owned businesses are not scaling at equivalent rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| as those of our non-Latino peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Some explanations as to why Latino businesses start and stay small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| include a lack of access to affordable capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| as well as access to systems that help us navigate regulatory environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| We believe that supporting Latinos in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| and our Latino-owned entrepreneurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| this will set our community up for current and future success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| as the Latino community expands and contributes to our local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| I want to encourage the city to continue to invest in black and brown-led organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| and initiatives that are working to address systemic inequities across our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you, Ms. Caballero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| That concludes the speakers who are speaking in favor on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| We'll now hear from three people who signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| The first person who signed up is Ms. Amelia James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Ms. James, if you could approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| You can start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| My name is Amelia James, 1925 Ayler Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| I am a licensed clinical social worker and therapist here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| I'm also a member of Knoxville HEART,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| which is the Healing East Tennessee Alternative Response Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| Our mission is to implement an alternative response team here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| to improve outcomes for people in crisis and reduce the demand for police involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| I'm here to implore you to remove the $400,000 of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| to expand the current KPD co-response pilot program from this year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| and use that money to instead fund an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Last year, during meetings about the co-response model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| Mayor Kincannon said this is no way intended as a be-all, end-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| It doesn't preclude us from also exploring an autonomous model like the CAHOOTS-type model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| Chief Thomas said of the co-response pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| it may not be what our community needs or wants, but maybe we can hopefully tailor it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| and if it does turn into a mental health-only responder or CAHOOTS model, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| This is just a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| What has unfortunately happened, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| is that this co-response model is being treated as an end-all, be-all for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| Instead of pouring more funding into a program that isn't what our city needs or wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| let's be innovative and address the actual public safety crisis that's happening in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| In my role as a mental health professional, I train others on de-escalation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| and I've never done a de-escalation training that doesn't center the principles of trauma-informed care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| So trauma-informed care understands that people's experience of trauma affects their thoughts, behaviors, and emotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| Some of the principles of trauma-informed care include safety, trustworthiness and transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| collaboration, empowerment, voice and choice, peer support, and taking into consideration cultural issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| When I de-escalate people, which is something I do often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| I'm not approaching the situation with a goal of getting the individual to comply with my demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| I'm approaching the situation centering safety, empowerment, and choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| As Chief Thomas said last year, we are not mental health professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| At best, we can barely triage on a 40-hour certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| In the co-response pilot program data, the average response time length for the KPD co-response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| that they spent with the people was 62 minutes, which Chief Thomas said is an eternity for a police call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| Do you know for who 62 minutes is not an eternity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Mental health professionals, because we understand that effective trauma-informed de-escalation requires patience and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| Police officers are not equipped with the training needed to provide this kind of de-escalation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| linkage to care, mental health assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| And insisting that mental health professionals and medics need police, need to be escorted by police to these types of calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| further reinforces the idea that people who are in mental health crisis are inherently dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| When in fact, people who are experiencing mental health crisis are more likely to experience victimization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| and are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| 36% of the calls the co-response team responded to in the data were for suicidal ideation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| and about 45% of the calls resulted in transport to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| Why do we need a police officer transferring people to the ER and doing mental health assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| I can tell you that in the past five years, I have regularly worked with people who are experiencing suicidal crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| who are actively using substances, who are distressed, dysregulated, experiencing houselessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| and I have never once felt unsafe or felt that my safety was in any way threatened by the clients that I'm serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| People in crisis are human beings who deserve to have their voices heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| and to be met with someone who sees their inherent worth and dignity and doesn't see them as a public safety threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| I also want to point out that the city is being very quick to pour $400,000 into funding a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| that again doesn't meet the needs of our community, but it also doesn't save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| Having police dispatch is the most expensive of all response options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| And so for $400,000, you could fund Knoxville Heart, you could fund an alternative response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| that once it's fully running could save millions of dollars for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| which I think is just fiscally responsible and it serves the needs of our community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you, Ms. James. The next person signed up to speak is Ms. Myra Connolly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| Ms. Connolly, if you could come to the podium, start by stating your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1565)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you. My name is Myra Connolly, 5726 Briscoe Circle, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| I want to encourage council to vote against this budget, not for the budget as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| As two speakers spoke in favor of the budget, there are many good pieces of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| but we can't approach this line item, but we have to approach the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| But my challenge is with the line item that Ms. James was just referring to, which is the expansion of the KPD co-responder model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| Many mental health professionals, including Ms. James, consider an alternative response team as a best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| An alternative response team, as you know, pairs a nurse or a medic with a behavioral health specialist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| and leaves law enforcement out of the situation. Many cities across the country are using alternative response models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Texas, Eugene, Oregon, Chicago, and Denver, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| Minneapolis is in the process of implementing a co-responder model because someone told them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| You know who told Minneapolis to implement a co-responder model? Cities United, who is our own consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| So Cities United may well come in here and tell us to do what the community is currently recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| It is on the list of things that Cities United routinely recommends as a violence interruption measure within its community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| Most important, as Ms. James said, an alternative response team takes police out of situations where they do not belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| KPD's own numbers show that police were not needed on the vast majority of co-responder calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| Yet on those calls, police presence has the possibility of escalating each individual encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1671)|
| 0:28:00| So when police are present in a nonviolent call, that's an unnecessary risk being taken by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| Just the presence of police has the potential to escalate an otherwise nonviolent intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| My question is this. Will it take a tragedy for us to understand that the KPD co-responder model is the wrong way to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| We don't want unnecessary risk. We don't want escalation and weapons involved in situations where they don't need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1704)|
| 0:28:32| Additionally, for the mayor to make good on her claim that she wants community input on reimagining public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| additional funding for the co-responder program should be paused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| And at this point, the only way to pause that is to negate the entire budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| The pilot program was supposed to be previewed before reauthorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| Constituents expected that such a review would happen publicly, but it has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| The mayor and Chief Thomas were surprised, perhaps stunned, definitely very surprised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| that they got a lot of negative feedback from rolling out the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| But that's what happens when you don't talk to professionals or you don't ask the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| The whole program was rolled out with no community input, and based on our research, with very little professional community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| it was considered one of the best practices across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| So I have one final point to make about some comments that Chief Thomas has recently made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| She was quoted in an article with Knoxville Compass as saying that when people call 911 in Knoxville, they expect to get a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| That argument is obviously not valid because people routinely call 911 asking for ambulance and fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| We know that 911 dispatch has the capacity to triage calls and send them to agencies appropriate for the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| That's exactly what happens in other cities that use an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| For example, in Austin, Texas, when you call 911, you get a menu, and it specifically says to the caller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| do you want EMS, police, fire, or mental health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| Additionally, the other thing we don't know here in Knoxville is how many people are not calling 911 because the only response they will get is a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1819)|
| 0:30:32| So wouldn't it be nice, as a Knoxvillian, if I look out my door one morning and I see someone in crisis on the street in front of my house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| I might think, I don't want to call the police because I'm not sure what the result of that encounter will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| Wouldn't it be nice if I had the option to call 911 and get a behavioral health response to such a crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| There is an easy way to do this. We can walk back this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| We can pause adding money to the co-responder model and give good, valid consideration of an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1864)|

| 0:32:27| As in past years, the FY21-22 budget allocates over $1 million of local funds directly to prevent homelessness and address the needs of those experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1947)|
| 0:32:39| including street outreach and support for the foyer, a low-barrier shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| In FY18-19, the homeless prevention budget was $1,226,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1965)|
| 0:32:58| The proposed budget for next year is $1,153,000, a decrease of around $75,000 from the 2019 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| The low-barrier shelter mentioned in the budget has only 40 beds, compared to Knoxville's around 900 overnight homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=1985)|

| 0:34:08| The 18-19 police operating budget was $55,181,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| Reported crime was down 6.1% year over year, and the next year reported crime was down 8.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2054)|

| 0:35:56| Thank you, Mr. Gibbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| We'll move to Ms. Testerman, discussion on the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you, Mayor. I do have a couple of budget questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| First, to Chief Thomas, during the budget hearings, you noted that Sergeant Clinton is currently the only officer as part of the co-responder team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2174)|
| 0:36:23| And just as we expand this program, can you share some insight on how we, as we add more co-responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| how we'll recruit, train, and add officers to this initiative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| Sure. What we plan on doing internally, of course, we'll work with the mental health provider again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| They will work on their end to find their person that will work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| But as far as which officers are selected, we will do what's called a posting through the department for officers who are previously certified in crisis intervention training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| not just had the familiarization, but are certified. And they will go through an interview process to determine which three would be best for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2215)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you for that. And then I do have a question for Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| As we, for all of our infrastructure endeavors, I know that sidewalks are at the top of our list and our constituents' list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| And I'm curious, I know on some of the sidewalk projects that we have to acquire property through acquisitions as part of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2238)|
| 0:37:33| And can you, are the fees within the budgeted allocation for the sidewalks, is that a separate allocation for as we have the list of these different sidewalk projects when we do have to acquire property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2253)|
| 0:37:47| Councilwoman Testerman, my understanding is that there is an allocation when the budget is first established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2267)|
| 0:37:56| Depending on how long the project is delayed, that allocation may have to be increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| But typically that is included in the original budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| So as we look at the different sidewalk projects, we're estimating based on those projects what we might have to acquire in order to complete that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| Okay. Ms. Testerman, you had your light still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| Okay. I think I saw Ms. Parker's, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you. And usually I would make a motion that we suspend our rules so that we can hear from more public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| But, you know, according to the memo that I sent out to you all earlier today, I really feel like we need more space, more time to discuss this program as well as alternatives to this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2321)|
| 0:38:59| And so that's why I would like to make a motion to amend the budget as well as call for a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2339)|
| 0:39:11| So that we can discuss further the co-responder model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| And my motion to amend the budget is by moving $400,000 from the police fund to our reserve fund until we are able to hold that public hearing on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| Mr. Law Director, could you just verify, is that a proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2364)|
| 0:39:39| That is a proper motion. The motion is to delete $400,000 from the KPD budget and transfer those funds to the reserve fund. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| Okay. Council, there's a motion on the floor. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2386)|
| 0:39:56| I have a comment. It is, do we need a second before we can talk about this? But it's a conversation that I want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2396)|
| 0:40:05| To talk about the amendment needs a second. To talk about the content of the budget, including stuff that Ms. Parker mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| It doesn't require seconding the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| It's not a motion I'm in support of, but we will continue the conversation about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| As Council wants to, yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| Okay, so there's no second to the motion, so the motion to amend fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| I'm not seeing anybody pull their mic forward, so we'll move back to the original motion to approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| Ms. Singh, do you want to ask some questions about the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| I do. I am in support of the co-responder model, but I don't think that that is, that we're done at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| It is something that the National Alliance of Mental Illness supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2457)|
| 0:41:07| I continue to ask for more and more tools for public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| I do not want to amend the budget to remove the money, because I think we need to start working on this with everything we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| But I need a commitment from the administration that we continue to look at other models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| the CAHOOTS model, the models where officers are not necessarily involved if they are not necessary at the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| I've been talking to 911. I know that it is with Mr. Anders there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| I know it's a very complicated procedure that includes a lot of different departments, the county, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| different departments from each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| How are we moving ahead on looking at that model, and when do we think we can try to get that budgeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2514)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you, Council Member Singh. I would just say that I'm very much committed to improving public safety in all forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| We've made more progress in the last year than I think we have in a generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| I'm proud that we went from a pilot of one social worker to now this proposal would make it a total of four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| so they could be working seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| And that is more social workers than we've ever had contracted to address these mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| So I'm certainly open to continuing to explore those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| It is complicated, and we have partners. We're not the only entity on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| So those conversations will continue, and like you said, the co-responder model is something that a lot of cities have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| They start with that, and then they explore other options as that develops and matures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| So I'm definitely committed to continuing those conversations and other violence interruption strategies that we are moving forward on if this budget is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| But if it isn't in this budget this year to fund a... I'm forgetting what... the CAHOOTS model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2590)|
| 0:43:20| If that's not in the budget this year, it means that it's not going to happen this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| and we have a full 13 months that it won't be in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| And I think we should move faster on something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| So we've approved a pilot for the co-response model. We tested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| We found it to be effective and successful, and now we're expanding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| So those kinds of things can happen in the upcoming budget year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| Is this something that we can have a workshop on and try to... the council understand it better and see which departments are involved and how we can start moving forward this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| I think Council Member Ryder was next, and then we'll go to Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah. So there's a lot in the budget besides one piece of any particular pot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| but I just want to clarify for everyone in the audience and listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| We are approving the budget, not specific necessary line items. They're directed to particular departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| This $400,000 could be used part of the year for one thing. We still have to approve a contract for how it's spent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2667)|
| 0:44:36| Correct. So we're not doing that tonight. We're approving the pot of money, and then ensuing is the conversation about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2676)|
| 0:44:45| and the contract that we review to expand upon anything that we've been doing or have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| I know we put out a specific RFP to do the co-responder model, and we approved that contract for the pilot that we've done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2692)|
| 0:45:03| Has anyone approached the city or had any conversations, a service provider that could provide a CAHOOTS-style model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2703)|
| 0:45:11| Has a provider been identified in our market that could provide that service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| No, but I'm going to have Ms. Gill respond to that in more specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| Yeah. Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| So just to make sure we're clear, the existing contract runs through July 31st, and we do have to bring any contract that would extend or expand a program to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| So you will have the ability to review whatever form of contract manifests as a result of this opportunity with funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| So I wanted to make that clear point. And building on, again, the request around a workshop, I think that is something that we very much anticipated that you would desire, and so we have already expected that that request would come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2745)|
| 0:45:58| And again, we will look forward to working with your council leadership to get that date on the calendar and certainly can make that happen really as soon as you all are ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| So we're very interested in sharing that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| I think, Councilwoman Ryder, you've touched on something really important here, is that when we look across cities who are doing co-response, we find that some of those cities also have alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2772)|
| 0:46:25| And so again, there's an important piece here that these programs that we are doing in co-response and that you've had speakers tonight mention, they are not mutually exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2785)|
| 0:46:35| And in fact, they can be extremely complementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| And I think one of the things that I think is important about the feasibility of such a program in Knoxville is that that immediate feasibility is somewhat limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| We think that there are benefits to this and that, as folks have alluded to, there are gaps that could be filled by such a model that don't require the presence of a trained officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| But I think one of the places where we have identified the need for more research and more capacity building, there's several of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| The first is the ability to effectively dispatch, excuse me, effectively triage at the dispatch level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| I think that's what you were alluding to, Councilwoman Singh, in terms of working with E911. That's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| We also have to see a readiness and a willingness of providers to offer not just ad hoc responses, but again, a systemic response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| If we are doing this at the 911 level, it means that we have to have the ability to respond systematically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| And so that there are a variety of different hurdles to clear when it comes to imagining what that can look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| And of course, thinking about all the data that we're getting with the co-responsive, really understanding those clear lines of delineation in terms of what the appropriate tool is in the toolbox at a very given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2855)|
| 0:47:46| And so I think, Councilwoman Singh, your point about how do we explain the tools in the toolbox is very much one of the things that we're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| So yes, absolutely. We have already and will continue to evaluate those alternative response and trying to seek opportunities to bring those new community partnerships to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| We have not identified a partner who is ready today to do such a program at a systematic level because of those elements of capacity building that have to happen, even at the point of 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2879)|
| 0:48:14| And so we are actively engaged with local partners on multiple initiatives, some of which are actually moving forward and thinking about grants and opportunities that we can pursue to build that capacity within those systems that become very critical to making such a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2894)|
| 0:48:29| Okay. One more question, Ms. Gill. You guys gave us data on the number of responses, I believe, in number was 199.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2909)|
| 0:48:40| And I clarified with you how many workdays that was. That was the co-responder singular team was four days per week, 115 workdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2920)|
| 0:48:50| Roughly, that was my back-of-the-envelope calculation. But yes, four days a week for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| How many calls are we making? Are they sitting on their desks doing nothing? Are they getting all the calls? Are they making all the calls? These are the kind of questions I'm getting. What are they doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2937)|
| 0:49:08| Exactly. And I'm going to turn it over to Chief Thomas because I think she can speak more to the day in the life of our co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| But yes, just to clarify, our co-response team currently only can operate four days a week. And so if you back out the number of days, I think it came to around roughly, let's call it that 115 mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| In addition to providing the direct response to the calls that come in at which the co-response team has dispatched, another pretty significant portion of the day is spent doing follow-up visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2961)|
| 0:49:35| So within a 72-hour period, the co-response team is trying to make a follow-up contact with each and every person who they interact with on a call to ensure that those individuals who have been referred to service ensure that they can get follow-up service, essentially touch base with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| And those follow-up calls not only take up a lot of time, but at the end of the day, they also are very important because they reduce the number of repeat calls that come in for an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2982)|
| 0:49:59| So we've been very pleased with those results. I will turn it over to Chief Thomas here, though, to provide additional clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| Yes, thank you. I think on the last page of the information sheet that we put out, they said on average we miss six calls, behavioral health calls. I would venture to guess that we probably could have responded to many more that we have officers responding to, evening shift, night shift, that do get referred out. But if we could get those on the front end with a co-response team, it would save a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3012)|
| 0:50:30| Six per a particular time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| Yes. Those are things that they've identified that they've missed at some point, but I still think that number is probably higher when we look at calls we respond to with our first responders, just with our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3034)|
| 0:50:45| So those calls are getting some kind of response, just not the co-responder team. So they're getting officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3045)|
| 0:50:53| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| They're getting police officers sent out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| They're getting officers involved, sending them to a hospital for evaluation, getting family involved. They're stabilizing those folks in some way, using our CIT officers. We have basic familiarization, but these are calls where the co-responders would aid greatly and be able to provide a better response for that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3061)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I do think that a workshop for council is in order to explore this more in depth. Also, more statistics around what the results of the pilot have been thus far. I'm definitely in favor of those dollars being in place so we can move forward with this co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3088)|
| 0:51:47| However, I think that we did hear some good comments and feedback. I think it was Ms. James who spoke, even when we talk about, you know, is there a prompt, or can a person say this is a mental health problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3107)|
| 0:51:59| So calling that call is triaged a little bit more quickly to get the person to where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| Also know that absolutely having an officer could escalate or exacerbate that person who is in crisis. So maybe is there an option that it is an un-uniformed officer who stands back and allows the mental health clinician and professional to address the situation first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| So I do feel like the workshop is necessary. I think that it would be good to continue to hear additional feedback from some of our partners that are in the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| The RFP that was put out, was that, how long was that listed? Because it sounds like we put an RFP out for other partners that have the capacity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3135)|
| 0:52:46| How long was that open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| Vice Mayor, I'll see if Ms. Gill or Mr. Noe, I mean we have rules on procurement and RFPs and we follow those rules. I'm not sure how many days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3171)|
| 0:53:02| I couldn't speak to it tonight. We can certainly look at it again. And I think part of the history that we could bring as part of the workshop would be just kind of talking about how these services are procured generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| And what our process looked like and could look like in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3188)|
| 0:53:18| Okay. And I'm asking that because I just want to make sure, do people know where to go to look to see that contracts are available, that there's an open process for them to bid on it? So when we say that we didn't get sufficient feedback or input, did people really know that it was available and what it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3198)|
| 0:53:37| And what that window of time and where that information is available. And so I think that that's another opportunity that we may have moving forward as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3217)|
| 0:53:45| So I would be in favor of us having a workshop so we can explore and find out exactly what were the results of the pilot, what are some additional recommendations when we look at whatever contract comes before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3225)|
| 0:53:57| Because again, we're just approving these dollars. We still would have to approve the contract to where those dollars go so what organization will actually conduct the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3237)|
| 0:54:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| Okay. So I would encourage you to just poll council members as to the best dates. And as you know, we're more than happy to provide workshops, provide staff support for workshops and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3253)|
| 0:54:24| You guys have been really diligent about calling those workshops and working really hard at them. They call them workshops for a reason. So I think that's a great idea to have one on this topic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| Council Member Parker and then Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3270)|
| 0:54:38| I wanted to clarify a couple of items. My understanding of the $400,000 is that is the proposed increase to the program and that there still is ongoing grant funding that previously existed that would continue to support the co-responder program. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| I'm going to ask Ms. Giltz to clarify that please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3284)|
| 0:55:01| So the $400,000 is the total amount budgeted for the co-response in the FY22. That is inclusive of the current social works program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3301)|
| 0:55:14| The $400,000 is the total amount budgeted for the co-response in the FY22. That is inclusive of the current social works program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3314)|
| 0:55:22| The $400,000 is the total amount budgeted for the co-response in the FY22. That is inclusive of the current social works program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| The $400,000 is the total amount budgeted for the co-response in the FY22. That is inclusive of the current social works program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3328)|
| 0:55:41| We believe that's correct, yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| Now, when the program was first initiated, there was a grant program that funded some work that KPD was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3346)|
| 0:55:57| It was $70,000 for working with the homeless sex workers. The money was pulled from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| I believe that's correct. I believe it was a community development grant that had to be transferred over to us for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| And that covered, and then we had to get the additional funds. I think it was an additional 20 or 25,000 funds from the regular budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3367)|
| 0:56:38| My question is whether that grant is ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| That grant is not able to cover the four social workers that we hope to have in the upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| So, again, I think this would be history questions that we don't have at our fingertips, but we would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| we can certainly make that part of the workshop to ensure that you all have clarity about the history of that funding, both in its pilot phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| as well as, and I think as we think about the workshop, potential opportunities through new grants that might be pursued to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3421)|
| 0:57:09| this type of work or other supportive types of work in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| Because, you know, I would be willing to propose a new amendment that we only move 300,000 so that the current model can stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3434)|
| 0:57:24| But I think that it's important that we, as a legislative body, make sure that we have the funding that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| And that we put in some accountability measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| Because, as you all know I do, I watched our discussion from July 28th before creating my memo that I sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3455)|
| 0:57:46| And I implore you all to go back and watch that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| It's the exact conversation that we are having tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| And I hope through the administration that they will commit money to do research, to look into alternative programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| It's the same kind of empty promises that we also want to commit to empty programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| But we're not going to hold them accountable unless we hold that money before they can move forward with programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3487)|
| 0:58:16| That's how we hold folks accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| I'm tired of having the same conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| I sat very patiently last time we had this conversation when this program was initially approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| And I waited for the opportunity for us to have an earnest conversation a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| Not only about the program, but as was promised at the time, about potential alternative programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| And if we do not create the space to include the public, to include those who have lived experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3527)|
| 0:58:58| who are the ones who are actually needing these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| We have not heard from anybody needing these service calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| And yet we are making such wild assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| I believe we need to hear from the public and have the public involved in reimagining public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| That is the only way we can implement new strategies in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| The public must be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| So we have a lot more items to discuss as a part of this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| A lot more items to discuss just as a part of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| And that's one reason why I do not feel like we can have this discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| You know, when we were handed the documents on Friday at our legislative budget hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| that explained the data coming from the co-responder pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| I knew then that this was supposed to be our review of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| but there was an empty room on a Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| The public didn't know that was our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| The public didn't have that handout that we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| The public has to be involved in these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| So, yes, I don't even know whether to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| You know, I have other concerns about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| but I know that what we're able to do as a city council is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| But I wanted to lift up some of those tonight just to highlight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3644)|
| 1:01:02| You know, one thing that we did not talk about during this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| we talk about it later, but not before we approve the budget, is the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| And to me, the capital plan indicates what are the city's priorities over the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| at least from today's standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| And I'm worried about some changes that I see in the capital plan from what we were given last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| For instance, the Burlington redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| has now been moved from community development or economic development to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| And what that communicates to me is that the two-point-whatever-million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| imagined for that area is only for streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| which the community has said has to come with the infrastructure investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| Do you all want to speak to that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| or do we just wait until we discuss the capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| I'm happy to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Your question is just to help understand the Burlington investment that we propose in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Discussions and getting community input to action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| Mr. Brace, if you wanted to sort of elaborate on that and explain further what the plans moving forward are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| if this budget is adopted, how we'd invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| Thank you very much, Mayor, and good question, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| And I'm going to kick this over, because this is two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| Owners of buildings and industries in that area that are going to create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| We specifically heard from the community about infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| That's why those dollars were moved over to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| Engineering is who manages our infrastructure projects, so we have enough dollars to do design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| which our community engagement folks and our engineering folks have been working with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| I'm now going to kick it over and talk about community development, economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| and there are other programs to do that beyond infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| I think just to specifically get to what Mr. Brace was speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| and Ms. Parker's question about those funds being in the capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| there was a community process that resulted in a plan for the utilization of city funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3818)|
| 1:03:46| to support the Burlington community, and I want to thank Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| for assisting community empowerment. Mr. Lomax was involved with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| as well as Don Michelle Foster, who has a long, ongoing relationship in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| and Ms. Wade's team from community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| Those funds were very specifically designated, of course, with support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| and leadership from Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| The community specifically asked for those funds to be utilized in the way that they're being allocated in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| Those are infrastructure projects that are managed by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| The funds, therefore, need to be in the engineering budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| in order for that process to be managed smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| Thank you, Ms. Walsh. Thank you, Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| Ms. Parker, there are several other council members with lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| We can come back to you if you prefer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| Ms. Fugate, you were next, and then Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just a quick clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| The $20 million that we're doing, that we have the cost overrun on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| is the public safety building. It's not just the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| It is police, fire, pension, and E911, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| And the city courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| It's not just the police department's headquarters. It's all public safety headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| And the city courts are being relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| My next question is on the $400,000 issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| Chief Thomas, I think what I understood from all this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| is that that money is not to hire not one more police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| That money will be used to hire social workers. Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| That is correct. Thank you. So the funds will only be used to hire social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| And as Councilwoman Ryder said, the money sits in that budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| and then a proposal will be brought to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| Do you agree with it or disagree with it to spend the money, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I just want, on the record, it is not hiring more police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| It is putting three additional social workers on the street that we do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Fugate. Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| Thank you, Mayor. Councilwoman Parker brought up something that just brought me back to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| It just upset me all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| But do we not have an issue with sex workers anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| Did we just pull that money from there and now that is not a population that we are trying to assist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| And then the idea that all of the extra ideas of public safety have to come from grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| We need to start thinking outside of the box with the bulk of our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| I know we get grant money for all sorts of different projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| but this needs to be more important than just if there is grant money available or if there is not grant money available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| We are just a very different society than we have been in the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| we have changed a lot over the last 50, 60 years and we need to change our models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| But let me get back to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| Two weeks ago I had voted no on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| not because of what was included or not included in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| It had to do with the principle of what is the role of City Council in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| Do we really have a say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| And I have voted many times no when there is a list of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| but I have never been in a position to say I can't do my job when you just want me to approve everything altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4078)|
| 1:08:08| I did want to speak once again with the Council lawyer about what happens if all of us vote no at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| and is this at the State level or the City Charter level that the Council does not have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| I am very impressed that Councilwoman Parker was able to find a way to find an amendment that is valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4102)|
| 1:08:31| but which level, is it the State level or the City level that prevents City Council from being more involved line-item-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4111)|
| 1:08:40| Well, Council Member Singh, to answer your first question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| it is the City Charter that mandates that if Council does not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| the budget, I believe, 15 days before a certain deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| then whatever the Mayor proposes shall become the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| I talked to the Finance Director last week and the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| even if Council did not pass the budget, about the City being able to pay its employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| pay its bills, pay its obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| So there is a mechanism in place that you might not ever get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| but the City has bond obligations, which it must meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| and as you have learned, the City is involved in so many different aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| whether it is street paving, police, fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| the services that have been discussed tonight, that those obligations must be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| And that is in the City Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| I have not looked. I do not know if there is some requirement under State law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| but I would think there is some sort of fiscal responsibility that local governments must maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| in order to simply function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| It seems like we are defining our limitations and our power by the absolute worst-case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| Like I said two weeks ago, I think we are all responsible adults that would not just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| we cannot agree, so we are not paying anybody this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| Instead of defining this from the worst-case scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| we are having more involvement with the check and balance system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| That is the piece that I am speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| Now, since I voted no two weeks ago on the budget, I received a few phone calls and a few emails from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| saying that I had made a commitment, that there were some of us who had made a commitment to vote yes on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| due to the funding for the affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| That was a big conversation to have, but it also adds to my point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| that I spoke with these people and said, it does not really matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| I will always vote yes for affordable housing, always, but that is not the question at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| Right now, if I vote for affordable housing, I am voting for many things I agree with, many things I disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| That is my point. We need to have a little bit more say-so in this budget process, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| Like I said, I am going back to checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| Again, I want to point out there is a lot in the budget that is not particular to this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| but we are talking about this topic and I feel there is a lot that is not being said that I think needs to be said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| which is the reason we are having this conversation, the reason we are talking about this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| the reason we are talking about having co-responder models or alternative response models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| is because over the last 20 to 30 years, the federal governments and the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| the singular federal government, and the state government have rolled back and cut back mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| We do not have a Medicaid expansion in the state, and I am not directing this at any one person in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| This is for everyone listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| We need to take those pieces and fill in the gaps with the tiniest pocketbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| and I have said this before in my three and a half years up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| The city has the tiniest pocketbook. Look at our budget compared to, and think about it every time you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| the federal government and the state governments decided we did not need Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| I am speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| We expected to fill in all the gaps and take care of everyone that does not have mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| We cannot form a hospital. We cannot fund all the drug rehab that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| And the police officers, if you talk to some of the ones who have been around for years and decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| or the firefighters that go out on the first responder calls, the shift in what they see on the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4392)|
| 1:13:19| has been immense and incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| We did not see decades ago because of the shift in care and lack of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| So something has to change on the federal and the state levels or some kind of support for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| We cannot expect police officers to do it because that is not what they were trained to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| and that is not what they went in to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| I am speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| And so the point is we cannot do it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| And the administration and council talked about this and we made a start and we made a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| And when we sit here and we look at the numbers, lots of these calls, an average of six a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| were not responded to with a co-responder model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| Most of the calls ended up with people getting mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| So I don't deem that a non-success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| I don't deem it the only response that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| I just think everybody needs to be aware that we can't do everything that the federal and the state government isn't doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| And one of the things that this budget can't do and doesn't do is all the drug treatment and other things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| And if we don't fill in those gaps, we are going to continually have all the issues that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| and they're not getting addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| Thank you, Council Member Ryder. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| Thank you, Mayor. There is a lot in this budget and we've talked about some items tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| but I want to go through a few other things that are in the budget that may be overlooked for those who are just now seeing this for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| I think the three biggest issues in our city most urgent are youth violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| affordable housing and homelessness, and just everybody getting back to work and getting transit to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| and workforce-related issues to small businesses after the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| And so there's a lot in this budget for those things, and I want to call those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| If we all created a budget by ourselves in a vacuum, it would look different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| We're not going to agree on everything, and it's impossible to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| And this budget wasn't created last week. It wasn't created last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| It's been created for the past year or more by listening to folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| So we'll disagree on things, and that's fine, but there's some things in here that I think we can all agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| Thanks to Justice Knox and others that have rallied around this issue, and the administration particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| but everybody here agrees on the Affordable Trust Fund. I'm glad that Justice Knox is here to see that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4558)|
| 1:16:06| Our city, unfortunately, due to COVID, got more funding for housing than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| So the glass-half-full version of that is that we spent more money on housing and homelessness this past year than we've ever spent in the city's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| We spent more money this past year on housing and homelessness than our city's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4578)|
| 1:16:26| The greatest need is that, and we've spent a lot of money on it, and so that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| One of the most expensive of capital budget items in here is Austin Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| something that this administration has continued from the previous administration and I think is a worthy continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| Youth violence is something that everybody in our city has paid attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| Everybody has been heartbroken by, and everybody wants to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| And there's not an easy way to do it, but we're trying, and we're active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| And so this council has already approved a million dollars for urgent response and for continued response and long-term planning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| More than that, the city, and this budget particularly, continues to fund the Office of Community Empowerment, which does great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4624)|
| 1:17:19| And there are a number of non-profits who have been working in this city to help youth violence for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| SEED, Boys and Girls Club, Urban Leads, Girls Club, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| World Talk, most recently the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| This budget has funding for those organizations, and those are the folks who are doing the real work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| So anybody, just as a shout-out to the whole city, if you want to help with youth violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| take out a checkbook or go to one of those organizations and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| Show up, because they've been showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| There's funding for all of those organizations and a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| And we shouldn't treat youth violence as a light switch that we can just fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| And so government can't fix it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| But we're trying, and we assign and empower those organizations who have been showing up on shoestring budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| So anybody that wants to help, go help those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| Show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| The third item. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| Please be quiet while council members are speaking. Go ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| There's about 120, so I'm not going to cover them, but they're on a page in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| Third of all is economic recovery due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| There's a lot of businesses that didn't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| There's a lot of businesses that hopefully will stay around, but only because we support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| Government can't make all the businesses come back, but we can do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| Workforce transportation is an area that we've invested in in this budget and will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| And there's a lot of creative ideas about how to get folks beyond the city for jobs outside the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| One of the things that we can do to improve the American Job Center and this organization of the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| which we fund, is focused on improving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| But also at the chamber and the Entrepreneur Center is continuing a program that we acted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| and created called 100 Knoxville, which funds black-owned businesses to help them grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| so they can hire people that look like them, live near them, and they can help grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| Real work and real actions happening in plain sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| There are a number of things that we can do in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| We'll never agree on them all. Progress isn't perfect, but we're making progress on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| I'm not for one minute proud of this budget, and I'm happy to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| There are things we've still got to work on. There will always be things we've got to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| But I'm happy to support the action of disagreeing well, understanding what the gaps are in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| and acting towards them the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| And this budget makes progress on the most urgent items in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| There's more work to do. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| I just had a few more items that I wanted to highlight that struck me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| One item is the funding for Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| When Lakeshore Park was presented to City Council, I was impressed by the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| and impressed by the community engagement in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| And even though there were some disagreements between some of the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| the city would continue to engage them throughout that planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4860)|
| 1:21:07| They have, I believe it's $2 million for the next five years, budgeted in our budget, so $10 million for Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4867)|
| 1:21:17| Now, I bring this up because I really don't think the city gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| Within the last year, in our lowest economic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| zip codes, our zip codes with the lowest economic outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| we have seen three park projects happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| that the community found out about maybe the day of or a day afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| where some donor came in and decided they wanted to give something to some poor folk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| and the community didn't get a chance to be a part of the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| We saw that at Morningside Park with Blue Cross Blue Shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| There was not meaningful public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| We saw that at the park behind Austin East, where there was a recent event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| We saw that, I think it was Candace Parker came in with the basketball paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| Who was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| But she sponsored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| I thought that was a cool project, but an elected official only found out the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| There are these opportunities when there are improvements being projected for a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| That's a community building activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| When community members are a part of the planning process, when those plans reflect their hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| and they lift it up as important for their community, they take more ownership of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| But when somebody comes in and it's whoever's got the most money gets to do whatever they want to in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| that's when you see people take less ownership of their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| I just have a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| I would like for us to have more projects like the Lakeshore Park project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| where organizations formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| I don't remember the name of the organization that's been tasked with overseeing this process for Lakeshore Park, this planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5006)|
| 1:23:36| Maybe we need more structures like that, but the city can play an important role in helping communities develop those structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| so that we have neighborhood organizations and we have other community organizations who are at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| When these discussions are taking place, that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| Another thing I wanted to lift up, which I can also lift up on the next agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| is I listed up some concerns I had about the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| Ms. Parker, you're speaking on 9B now, or 9A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| Well, it's a part of the budget, so I was saying I can speak on both issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| We've made a significant commitment to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| I want that commitment to continue, but I want us to review it on an annual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| to make sure that we are achieving the outcomes we intend to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| Part of my concern is that for this funding, it's city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| And so we can do things with this funding that we might not be able to do with HUD dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5082)|
| 1:24:50| HUD may want us to use Knoxville metropolitan area to calculate area median income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| but for city dollars, we can assess whether that is reaching those in most need in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| And my concern is that we're not reaching those in most need when we're using that larger budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| Area median income that is at a much, much higher level than so many of our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5112)|
| 1:25:19| especially if you just look at 37915 and look at what the area median income is in that zip code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5119)|
| 1:25:27| and compare it to the metropolitan number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| There are parts of the budget that I feel like it just needs a little tweak in some places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5132)|
| 1:25:41| if we would listen to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| I'm sympathetic to what Councilwoman Ryder is saying, but it's also frustrating because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| especially from my end, I feel like we're not asking for the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| Our charter actually allows the city to establish a public hospital if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| And we're talking about $65 million for a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| A public hospital for much less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| And you can put the rest of the money in a good, nice income-generating account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| to help cover the cost of that hospital moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| So that is absolutely not out of the realm of possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| But for this discussion, we are sticking within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| And I think we should leave space for those discussions, even though we want to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5192)|
| 1:26:40| But allow space for us to talk about what we want to do with the money simply allocated in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| Nobody's asked for a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| Nobody's asked for money to be added in a tremendous way in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| And we want to have really reasonable conversations within the confines of the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| So I would hope, you know, I don't think we're going to achieve anything tonight or this round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| But I would hope moving forward that members of Council are more open to listening to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| during this process and bringing those concerns forward when we have this budgeting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| and opportunities for members of the public to address this during the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| I don't feel like it's disrespectful to the Mayor to bring these issues forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| This is what we've been elected to do, represent our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| But right now, it feels like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| It is absolutely disrespectful to propose an amendment to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5267)|
| 1:27:56| But I do truly feel like in order for us to have transparent processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| that the public can engage in and trust, doing things like, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| we did have some, you know, announcements coming from our communications department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| You know, highlighting different parts of this budget and telling the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| what is intended with this money and what will happen once this budget is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| And so I feel like expectations have been set for the $400,000 and that there hasn't been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5309)|
| 1:28:39| you know, we have not sent the message to the public that alternatives are being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| We have not considered alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| And I feel like we need to do that before we commit funding towards the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5335)|
| 1:29:03| I think I just want to point out, I mean, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| when we enter, as Council Member Smith mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| this budget, you know, budgets take a great deal of time to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| And we had the mayor's budget hearing where we had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| to hear from every director throughout our city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| to hear what their priorities are, to hear, and also spent two days last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| again, walking through the budget, listening to the director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| having the opportunity to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| And this budget comes as a result of our administration listening to people in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| all of us that are elected, listening to people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| There have been, there are opportunities, those two days of budget hearings are open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| public forum, and, you know, I think, I want to commend the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| I want to commend the directors who are spending countless, tireless hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5409)|
| 1:30:18| really evaluating all the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| And we're not going to accomplish everything in a year or necessarily five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| I mean, there are priorities, and it's hard to determine what those priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| But everybody within this administration will sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| will talk ad nauseum for however long any of us want to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| and understand a topic, a priority, a budget allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| And we'll call back immediately, and we'll spend the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| helping all of us understand so we can provide the residents of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5454)|
| 1:31:00| with answers they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| And so the thing is, again, this is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| These are conversations that we have all year long, that the mayor sits down with each of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| at will on a phone call monthly, weekly, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| and has these conversations about what the priorities of our community are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| And to, you know, again, my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| you know, we're all not going to agree on everything, and we're all going to have different priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| But this budget is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| It is addressing some of the crisis issues that we are faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| And we can't solve them all overnight, but we are in forward motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| Not everybody is going to agree, but I will tell you that with a lot of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| that are taking place, be it housing, be it homelessness, be it violence in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| it is top of mind for every single person up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| Thank you, Council Member Testerman. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| Seeing none, all those in favor, please vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| Any opposed? No. Motion carries 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5537)|

| 1:32:27| I'm really proud of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5547)|

| 1:33:49| and you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5629)|
| 1:33:57| Thank you, Council. My name is Calvin Danny Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| I live at 1931 Locarno Drive, Northeast Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5642)|
| 1:34:11| I'm on the ministry team at New Oak Missionary Baptist Church, and I'm also co-president this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| for Justice Knox, and so right now I'm just representing all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| If it's okay, I'd like Justice Knox to raise a hand or stand up just to acknowledge our presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| Amen. So again, thank you for the opportunity to work together toward advancing an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5670)|
| 1:34:42| that we were in complete agreement over that was in need of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| So we've spent the past few years working toward the ordinance that we're discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| and we're hopefully going to have complete approval on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5694)|
| 1:35:01| Prior to the first reading, we, Justice Knox, held our annual Nehemiah Action at Wells Fargo Park and on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5701)|
| 1:35:10| Most of you, or many of you, were there, and we do deeply appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| Altogether, that night, Justice Knox had 1,250 people come out to support or take part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| or take time out of their day to participate in that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| And those people represent thousands more because we are made up of congregations from throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5728)|
| 1:35:38| and very diverse, and it's a wonderful experience thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| I think it's sort of like, I've said this before, Democracy 101, because we don't know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| We don't necessarily have a lot in common other than the desire to see things done in a just manner and in an efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5749)|
| 1:36:02| I was pleased to work on the team from Justice Knox with the mayor and her staff, and we're just, everything's been wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5762)|
| 1:36:11| We didn't agree all the time, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| When the pandemic happened, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| We went from meetings to Zooms, that's okay, because in the end, we worked together to create something we felt would be beneficial to the entire city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5781)|
| 1:36:32| because it recognizes a starting point to dealing with a problem that is deeply problematic and will get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| People in our city are desperately in need of decent, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5798)|
| 1:36:48| People like my own grown son came here to supposedly help his aging parents, but he found a job right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5808)|
| 1:37:00| It's in a local restaurant chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| Within a year, I was so proud of him, within a year, he worked up from a dishwasher to an assistant manager, in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5825)|
| 1:37:16| But he still wasn't making enough to live on his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| As an assistant manager of a store, restaurant, he made $11 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5841)|
| 1:37:29| I think you need like 19 to have your own place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| $11 is the largest local financial commitment to affordable housing that the city has ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| This commitment is an investment that will pay dividends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| When people have stable homes, they can take care of their families, and the whole community will benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5867)|
| 1:37:54| because there will be fewer conflicts around the hassles that arise when you have to make too many decisions in a short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5874)|
| 1:38:05| Is this fund everything that we need to solve all the problems with housing? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| But it is a wonderful start. It's a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| It's a wonderful down payment, especially because of the way it's formulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| It's not fixed. It's flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| It allows the city to adjust priorities as needs change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| I don't think he can really do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| But I would like to say let's keep working toward resolving those issues that reflect those who make up that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5920)|
| 1:38:49| Oh, I'm about out of time. I used to be a preacher, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| Let's keep working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| We don't want to be antagonistic. We want to be cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| And we want people in the city to benefit from living in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| Thank you, Mayor. Colleagues, again, I know we passed it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| It will be a joyous day for all who worked on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| I want to thank my Justice Knox friends that I made by being on Zoom calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| It was a fabulous opportunity for us to work together and for the folks who aren't here on the expanded committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| the realtors, the home builders, non-profit and for-profit developers, tax attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| folks that know everything about housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| And I forgot last time, and I was terribly remiss, I did not thank Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| And Becky Wade has done yeoman's work for years in this community on affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| I worked with her 30 years ago. We were three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| I just refuse to believe that we're as old as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| But it's tremendous work, and Becky led us through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| keeping us educated about all the different federal funding requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| and what our city dollars could do to expand affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| So I think this is a joyous day. If all my colleagues will vote yes again. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| I also just want to echo the gratitude to everyone who's been involved, and a special shout out to Justice Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| You all have been pushing the envelope and yet happy to come to the table and work on this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| And that's made for a strong and better outcome for the whole city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6056)|

| 1:45:17| which is fascinating and connects to all aspects of the city and brings in a coherence to the city that we've not had before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| and a connection to the rest of the country and the rest of the world in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| History is relevant to almost all the decisions that are made in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| and I and the Knoxville History Project, we hope we can help with the city making its decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| that are associated with our constantly fascinating and constantly surprising history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6339)|

| 1:47:05| and for those who may say, well, why are we just naming one room after them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| Well, first of all, that was the only room left, but that room was very appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| because we later learned that they both have worked together in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| researching and studying history together and what a wonderful collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| what a wonderful partnership that you both in relationship and friendship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| that you all have established over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6450)|

| 1:47:40| and all that you contribute to Knoxville history and Mr. Booker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| you being part of Knoxville's black history is even more special for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| and so thank you both and God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6470)|

| 1:48:01| which is still on my shelf and I review it very often and it opened my eyes a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| to a part of history of Knoxville that hasn't been highlighted so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| or hadn't been at that time. Later there was a documentary that was done on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| and I viewed that more than once. So thank you, Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| And Mr. Booker, for those who don't know, is seriously an accomplished singer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| If you've never heard him sing, you're up for a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| My old friend Jack Neely, I remember Jack and I when we were in our 20s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| we were walking the avenues and alleys of Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| and back then Jack always impressed me with his sincerity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| and that sincerity is carried over into his writings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| and Jack has been so generous with people who were neglected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| in Knoxville, artists that we had never heard before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| I get a little choked up because he highlighted some people with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| that I wasn't aware of and they had not been given their due in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| and Jack had generously and tirelessly devoted his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| I'll just name two. There's many more. Buford Delaney, the artist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| and James Agee, the writer. There's many, many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| But thank you, Jack, for what you've done for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| I just really, really appreciate what you've done to reshape the identity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| of Knoxville and make it honor the people who have contributed to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| that beforehand really hadn't gotten the notice that they deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6589)|

| 1:56:24| I really did not feel that the language used to describe this agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6984)|
| 1:56:31| and the reasoning behind the need for it was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=6991)|

| 1:58:36| Yes, this has been a great addition to that part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| and it will be coordinated with existing Sharps Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| which has been in existence by the city for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| And there will be trails that connect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| so it will be somewhat kind of a seamless whole when it's all consolidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| Good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7136)|

| 1:59:38| I'm a teacher at Central High School for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| I have six children, all graduates of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| And our police officer is important in our building on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| He is an educator, just like I'm an educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| and just like our administrators are educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| He builds positive relationships with our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7195)|

| 2:00:02| He's able to head off problems before they ever start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| He's just a very positive influence in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| Our KPD officer is different from our school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| Their experience of our KPD officers in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| averages a minimum of 10 years of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7220)|

| 2:00:27| School security officers have, on average, three to four years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| It's just not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| We need both of our officers in our buildings, school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| We also need our KPD officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| And I don't want to go back to school next fall without them in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| I hate to think what our school would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| It's a daily, constant team effort to keep everyone in our building safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| and moving in a positive direction academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| So I urge you to work on the Memorandum of Agreement with KPD, with Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| to keep our officers in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| They're important, and they do great work on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7267)|

| 2:01:34| The debacle of the knee-jerk reaction by the mayor and the police chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| to withdraw from the MOA relating to the presence of law enforcement within Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7300)|

| 2:01:53| in future discussions with the community regarding such presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7313)|

| 2:02:01| That is, if their purpose was to wash their hands of any further attempts to link them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7321)|
| 2:02:10| with initiating open, honest discussions about police actions in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7330)|
| 2:02:18| or if their purpose was to further obfuscate and delay any possible accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7338)|
| 2:02:25| in the death of Anthony Thompson, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| along with the district attorney who has tied up the release of the TBI's investigation file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7349)|
| 2:02:36| until the potential prosecution of the person who provided the gun to Anthony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| Without the release of the TBI file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| the police department's internal investigation into the officers involved in the shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| doesn't officially begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| Slick, eh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| Looks like four police officers will be on paid leave for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| Their lawyers must be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on your point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| clutching their pearls, the school board voted down the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| related to this golden opportunity presented to them out of the blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| by the mayor and the police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| Their lawyers are probably proud too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| It's easy to understand why police officers react without thinking of the consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| when so-called leaders do so with such complete disregard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7410)|
| 2:03:35| What's not so easy to understand is what motivates those police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| to take immediate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| Are they paid extra or expected to close cases as quickly as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| Or perhaps it's a promise made to a pretty young girl that her boyfriend will be arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| or have warrants against him by the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| so she will be free to enjoy her life and all the young men lined up to treat her right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7436)|
| 2:04:02| Are police officers really trained to talk to young girls that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| They are, after all, just regular human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| who, unless trained otherwise and guided by specific policies, make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7452)|
| 2:04:20| Pushing onto the school board their responsibility for examining whether these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7460)|
| 2:04:28| had considered every option before going into the school unannounced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| to arrest a juvenile on no more than a simple assault charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| the mayor and chief put the entire Knox County Schools community on edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| fearing that they were going to be stripped of the security they have come to expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| by having police in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| Big mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| Thankfully, nobody died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| As each day passes and there are no answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| I'm appalled by the complete business-as-usual attitude of the mayor and police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| They have either missed the point entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| or they are so consumed with protecting themselves and their positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| that they will go to any lengths to cover up and disguise what occurred in that bathroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| at Austin East High School on April the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| And equally as important, what should have been done differently by those officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| It's time to stop this nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| Stand up and own up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| This was a tragic mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| You owe Anthony's family an apology now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| You should begin in earnest a negotiation with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| to compensate them in any way possible for this terrible loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| You know and all your lawyers know that this isn't going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7550)|
| 2:05:56| You have an obligation to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| fix this and fix the policies that allowed this to happen in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7559)|
| 2:06:06| Then you and the school board and the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| and the district attorney and the TBI could go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| and take all the time in the world to pursue your internal investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| Behind closed doors and in the dark if that suits you so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7578)|
| 2:06:27| Next person signed up to speak at public forum is Greg Ducey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| Mr. Ducey, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| state your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| Thank you Mayor Greg Ducey, 3529 Debonair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7597)|
| 2:06:44| I appreciate the passion that I saw this evening from Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7604)|
| 2:06:51| Councilwoman Parker in particular and Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7611)|
| 2:06:58| Thank you for the passion you shared and the things that I learned a lot about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| You're all right, the issues that we've talked about tonight are not easy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| They take time to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| No one is ever happy totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| I believe we're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| A couple of things I wanted to comment on that I didn't get to talk about last time is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7638)|
| 2:07:24| first I'll start with Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| I'm glad you're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| I wanted to compliment you through my friend Kathy who's had a lot of health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7649)|
| 2:07:36| One of your chiefs, Rusty Singleton, has really been there to help her over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| This compliment goes to you, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| I want people to know that some good things do happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| I personally had a phone interaction with Sergeant Don Zarillo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| If you look on the Internet, there's a story about Don Zarillo being a shining star for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7682)|
| 2:08:11| He was awarded something recently, but he personally helped me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7691)|
| 2:08:18| and my friend Kathy solve an ongoing problem that had to do with safety, drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| and other things in the Pleasant Ridge area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| I wasn't getting a lot of response because I really wasn't talking to the right police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7709)|
| 2:08:35| So the frustrations I hear tonight from some people, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| It is frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| But persistence and rationality and politeness do go a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7724)|
| 2:08:51| I think Justice Knox, and they're not here now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| shows a way and models a way that we can work together and get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7736)|
| 2:09:06| So thank you to both of the chiefs for some of the good things that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7746)|
| 2:09:13| I mentioned last time in the comment from Councilman Smith, I really appreciated that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7753)|
| 2:09:20| I heard it as a challenge when you said, we need to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| People need to show up, and they are showing up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| How many are showing up for things like the cleanup of the historic cemeteries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7769)|
| 2:09:35| I got one e-mail from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| I also talked about the homeless population and the lost sheep ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| which, by the way, those viewers and people in the audience and council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| we've been serving the homeless for 22 years on Wednesday evenings down off Ehlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7789)|
| 2:09:57| So step to the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| We need volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| Come tomorrow night or any Wednesday night at 630 or earlier and jump in there and serve food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7801)|
| 2:10:09| Work at the medical table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| If you're a medical person, we could have a mental health table, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| Some of the mental health professionals that spoke up earlier, come down and volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| This is a very marginalized group, as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| I'd like to compliment you, Mayor, on some of the things that were just talked about a few moments ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7824)|
| 2:10:31| on what the city is doing with these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| It's not an easy problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| These homeless people, I consider my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| I've served them for over ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| And the city is trying to do and make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| It's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| And finally, I want to compliment Stephanie Brewer-Cook, who many of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| The audience may not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| She's our head ADA coordinator for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| My friend Kathy and I, she refers to as the dynamic duo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| I'm able-bodied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| My friend Kathy is not so able-bodied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| And we look for things, like sidewalks, that don't have ramps, and we report them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7871)|
| 2:11:18| Not complain, but we ask for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| You're heard a little better when you ask for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| And so I encourage anybody who wants things done in this city and improvements, try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7884)|
| 2:11:30| And use Justice Knox maybe as a model of how that can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| Thank you, all of you, for your service to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| Thank you, Mr. Ducey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| Next person signed up to speak is R. Bentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| Mr. Marlowe, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7912)|
| 2:11:53| I don't think he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| Last person signed up for public forum is Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| Mr. Emmons, if you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7923)|
| 2:12:12| Hey, I'm Sam Emmons, and I live at 301 Woodlawn Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7932)|
| 2:12:19| And tonight I'm just here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| First of all, I just want to say thank you for serving our city in the way that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7944)|
| 2:12:31| And just your patience and forbearance, I guess, I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7951)|
| 2:12:41| I'd like to speak maybe just one sort of small idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7961)|
| 2:12:51| Speak to one thing, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| And it's something that I think is kind of difficult when making decisions under observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| like you all have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| Making decisions under observation is tough because it's hard to actually know under pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| always what's good and what's bad, and then what's kind of in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7986)|
| 2:13:13| Sometimes it's clear what's good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| Sometimes, a lot of times, most of the time maybe, it's not always perfectly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=7996)|
| 2:13:24| So I'll just give two examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| One thing that, in my opinion, is generally bad for our city is fear-based policymaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8006)|
| 2:13:34| And fear-based policymaking is understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| What is there to be afraid of in our time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| I guess implied threats of violence or disapproval or accusation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| or vows of political retribution or reckoning are common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| There's a pretty long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| So I would just say, beware of people who attempt to exploit those fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8037)|
| 2:14:06| If you're motivated by bitterness, those motivated by bitterness don't bring health to a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8046)|
| 2:14:15| So bullies don't understand justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| A smug person doesn't understand justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| You don't have to give them the time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| That one, to me, is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| A more nuanced topic, kind of in a different direction, is something like building generational wealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8071)|
| 2:14:40| It's a harder conversation to see everything clearly in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8080)|
| 2:14:48| So in my view, no matter what a person's circumstances are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8088)|
| 2:14:55| I think building generational wealth has an important antecedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| and that is building generational peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8100)|
| 2:15:07| I do think, though, if people reject what's sacred, including the concept of forgiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8107)|
| 2:15:14| we reject generational peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| And if we reject generational peace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| the only way generational wealth can be built is through means that might be bad for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| So what should we expect of our communities then and our society?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8128)|
| 2:15:35| And how can economic security be built or rebuilt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8135)|
| 2:15:41| I think that if we don't expect citizens to commit to their families to the extent possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| to their communities, and even to local religious institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| no governmental means will be very effective at bringing lasting peace and prosperity to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8152)|
| 2:15:59| The actions and decisions of citizens are not arbitrary in their impact on policy efforts such as Housing First, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8159)|
| 2:16:10| Citizens' actions matter in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| Building economic and social well-being takes several things, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8174)|
| 2:16:21| It takes a lot of effort. It takes generosity and interdependence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| And I also think it takes committed relationships, like marriage or community relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8187)|
| 2:16:34| Otherwise, we're going to spin our wheels as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| And I think these are reasonable things to expect of our citizens, to expect our citizens to commit to the basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8199)|
| 2:16:47| Before they start trying to build fancy things, are they building well in the basic things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8207)|
| 2:16:55| And I think that's a reasonable expectation to have of our citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8215)|
| 2:17:00| So, again, just thank you for your service to our city, and have a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8220)|
| 2:17:08| Thank you, Mr. Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| Council, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| If you guys will give me the grace to speak for just two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| There's something that has been on my mind for a long time, and it's been hit on a little bit by people who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8238)|
| 2:17:26| The aspect of domestic violence that was present in the situation that we've all been struggling with has not been spoken to at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8246)|
| 2:17:36| The L.A. Times reported on this whole event in Knoxville and reported that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8256)|
| 2:17:42| one victim here that has not been spoken for is the little girl that was being physically abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8262)|
| 2:17:50| And the L.A. Times said he pushed her and pulled her hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8270)|
| 2:17:57| That is such a minimizing of what women and men go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| And simple assault is a good reason to have the police involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8282)|
| 2:18:10| To protect my daughter, that's what I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8290)|
| 2:18:15| And to protect women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| I've been having this discussion with the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| There are people who are scared now to call when they're being hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8301)|
| 2:18:28| And this isn't being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| And I've always said, and I know so many of you agree, when this is happening in the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| when it's interpersonal or intimate partner violence, we act like it's personal and private and not our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8315)|
| 2:18:42| But when it comes out into the community, we act like, wow, where did that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| It's all related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| Sorry to end the evening on such a loving note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| Okay, thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| Is there a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| Okay, motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210518?start=8342)|
