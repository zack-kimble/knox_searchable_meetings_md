| 0:03:39| Thank you. We'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| I'd just like to mention early on here, we do have several members that are going to be leaving early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| and so we're going to try to push forward with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| And also, I wanted to go ahead and, Mr. Hammond, do you have anything to mention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Go ahead and ask Mr. Steve Joyner to begin, and if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| we have addressed the public forum issue, if you'd begin with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=239)|
| 0:04:09| They just want to go down there and we'll fix the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=249)|
| 0:04:23| One of the things we want to do as facilitators is be available for any constituent who wants to talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| I think there's sometimes a misunderstanding of what facilitators do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| My job is to help this elected body build bridges and build processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| allow them to come to conclusions and decisions that are best for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| However, in that process, I try to make myself available for any of the constituencies who want to visit with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| And so what we will do, and although since I live out of town, I have to limit my trips in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| so what we will do is Tuesday, August 9th, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| here in this building, is it room 460, Susan, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| In the commissioner's conference room, I'll be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| City Council's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| City Council's, I'm sorry, City Council's conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| I'll be available from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in 30-minute increments for anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| any group or any individual who'd like to come and visit with me about their perspective in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| As I said before, even though I don't answer to those groups in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| it's really important for me to hear what everybody says, their opinions, and their perspective on the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| So we're going to make that day available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| I believe that you can, Susan has a sign-up sheet tonight if someone's here and interested to sign up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| We're going to post that on the website with a phone number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| and the way you sign up there is to call, Susan, they call the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| They call the City Council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| They will sign up for a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| We prefer that you sign up for a time because if there's no one on the sheet, you know, I may leave early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| so make sure if they want to be part of that discussion, they pre-register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| and that's Tuesday the 9th from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. here in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=366)|
| 0:06:15| I'll just give you the number, and you can go ahead and begin with the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| The phone number is 865-215-2075.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=378)|
| 0:06:31| As much as I don't want to, I'll work from this mic until we get another one, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| Does that sound good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| I'm really excited to be back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| It's been an interesting couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| I want to begin by commending this group for the process they've been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| You know, in the last two weeks, we spent a lot of time looking at collaborative governance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| One of the things that are happening across this country is the increase of the collaborative governance idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| the idea of just a group of individuals, a group of legislative people getting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| and deciding what's best for somebody else is beginning to transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| and we're finding the process you've used where you've selected the outside committee people from community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| they build the collaborative process and bring that then to another group to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| and bring to you as becoming a pretty standard form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| ranging everything from the Terry Shavo law down in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| Got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Yeah, we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Everything from the Shavo work in Georgia, the land use work out in California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| the process you're using seems to be pretty much the standard process that most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| many, many city governments are using and county commissioners are using now to come to those conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| So I just want to affirm you on the good process you've been involved in up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| I do want to mention some who haven't been here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| just real briefly kind of some of the ground rules for what a facilitator does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| I've had a few people, not you guys, but a few people in the community somehow have the idea that I'm here to influence decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| That's not what I'm here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| A good facilitator is here to help build process for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| I am completely neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| I am from Nashville, but really I'm from Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| I don't care what you guys decide as long as you have a good process and you need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| I'll remind you also that I will talk individually with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| With some of you I've visited either by phone, by email, and personally with other constituency groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| In those individual conversations, those are confidential unless you give me permission to specifically mention what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=518)|
| 0:08:47| I will talk about themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| That's not breaking confidentiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| If I say there are a number of people who thought this, I don't consider that breaking confidentiality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| but I won't attach names to conversation if people prefer I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| A guy named Robert Axelrod is kind of a game theorist who studies complex problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Axelrod kind of says that complex issues like this that are really layered require two things from the decision-making group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=547)|
| 0:09:17| One is a high degree of forgiveness, and two, flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| It's really interesting, his work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| They call them complex adaptive systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Systems like yours that have a lot of moving parts with a lot of interest being involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Axelrod says we've got to first learn that a lot of stuff gets said that we can't take personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| A lot of stuff happens that's just awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| I haven't been a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| I don't know what all has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Really professionally, it doesn't matter to me what has gone on so much personally in the past because we want to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| But the difficult part, Axelrod says, about being a leader is we're human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| We have these feelings, and we have ideas, and we have commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| I know this is not true of the people of Knoxville, but sometimes constituents can be rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| Sometimes they can say things that they shouldn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| What Axelrod says is we have to be really almost like Teflon with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| For us people to manage this process, we're going to have to work on just moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| The second is flexible, that wherever we are, being able to listen and be able to adapt to the conversations around us are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| As a precursor to that, I know you started three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| It's been before you quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| There's got to have been things that have happened that you wish hadn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| The challenge for us is to take this moment and manage it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| It's kind of a little statement of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| With that in mind, I'd like to kind of move forward for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| In our last meeting, we said we'd begin the discussion of substantive kind of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=660)|
| 0:11:10| Begin to talk about what is it that pulls us together, what is it that separates us, what the challenges are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| I want to begin that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| I understand we're going to have a shortened session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| We'll work as much as we can tonight, but we'll pick back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| This is an ongoing process, and it'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| I want to talk about that, but I want to begin with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| I want to facilitate a question with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| Here's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| This document that you're discussing, in your mind, what is your understanding that it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| If you guys decide to adopt this document as is, what's your understanding of what the force of that document is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=702)|
| 0:11:52| What does it do at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| Well, I think that's where one of the bones of contention is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| Obviously, we have a planning commission that is charged by state law with getting a nice overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| and a general direction of where the community is going, setting forth a vision of what we think we want to become over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| And this document is designed to fit into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| A question has been raised as to whether or not the specifics and the details are such that they don't belong in a vision statement-type document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=745)|
| 0:12:37| as opposed to a regulatory-type document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| But the reality is that this plan, everything we do has to conform to a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| This plan is set up to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| And so I guess we're setting a direction for both wise development and preservation of what we think is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| whether it's aesthetics, whether it's environmental, whether it's some other water quality, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| So kind of what I hear you saying here, Nick, is that there's this 2033 general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| Within that, there's this kind of amended document, this plan that sets direction for where we want to go in terms of water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| in terms of management of resources, in terms of building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| And you said you understand that there may be some discussion about the actual regulatory power of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| Is that kind of what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| And I understand that everything we do, every ordinance, every zoning ordinance, every sector plan we do must conform to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| So it has, in my mind, a legal significance in terms of constraining activity or directing activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=810)|
| 0:13:39| whichever, you know, whether you want to be positive or negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| And the other thing is our general plan, there's been some talk about it, this thing is too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| but the general plan actually incorporates about a dozen or more other small specialized plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| So this could be another, for example, specialized plan incorporated by reference, and it would fit the structure of what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=835)|
| 0:14:04| So it's not necessarily inconsistent with the general plan idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| So I hear you talking about that fitting into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Anybody react to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Does somebody have a different perspective of how this particular document might work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| Yeah, Doc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Well, I'm going to give you, and these aren't necessarily my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| but I'm going to give you what people would think about the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| and how it's going to work from several different points of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| and I'll give you several points of view within what we would call each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| I'm trying to avoid any of the loaded terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| But if you ask some of the people that are the very strong proponents of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| I think even there you have a little bit different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| I think some people would say what this document does, it protects our slopes, it protects our hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| it makes it a more aesthetically, it makes it a plan that's more aesthetically pleasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| not only for now but the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| It allows more high-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| It allows more green space, and that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| You talk to another group of opponents on that side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| they'll say, well, it will stop the sediment from running into the storm water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| It will stop the erosions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| You know, they're looking at it from a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| It will stop some of the problems we've had with it rolling down in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| and protecting other people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| On the other side, if you look at people who are in favor of economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| they'll say that this will, that the plan inhibits some of the economic development that we need to increase our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=928)|
| 0:15:36| If you talk to developers, they'll say that it's just another burden that they have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| in a very difficult economic environment that hurts employment of some of their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| And if you talk to people who are landowners, and they can be some of the most angry, as Tony knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| but what they would say is that this is the government basically trying to confiscate private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| and tell us what we can do and not do on property that doesn't belong to the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| but that it belongs to, you know, this belongs to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| And we ought to be able to do, you know, the more fair-minded people say we ought to be able to do with our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| as long as we're not harming anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| And so you kind of get this broad view that this plan has, depending on perspective, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| It can do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| But I hear you saying the perception is this plan has a lot of power over what people do with their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| or the property they work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Am I kind of hearing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Somebody else hop in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| I want to hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Many of us want to talk about what's this plan, your perspective, what's this plan do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1000)|
| 0:16:50| I have a little bit of a therapeutic background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| I can look at you like 45 minutes and charge you about an hour or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Does anybody else have something to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Does that summarize it enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Steve, I think it does summarize various perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| But fundamentally, I think what it does is it does what it was asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| And the document represents, you know, the reduction of three years of work by committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1032)|
| 0:17:22| that were going to take up this task of figuring out what's the best way to develop our hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| And that's what it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| And I think it's a very good attempt at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Yes, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| That's my impression, that it doesn't inhibit growth, but it tells us how to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| It's kind of like a trellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| And so I hear you say it's kind of almost like a, what's the last word you used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| Like a trellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| A trellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| It sets direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| It's kind of a mapping tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| I mean, I can't tell you that I completely grasp in my brain the entire, all the complexities of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| Because many of the things that you summarized, you know, from all the different points of view, I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| And I don't know if any of us are real experts on the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| But you're asking us to comment just our general impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Of what this plan, what we intend, what we would like this plan to do, whether it does that or not, would be up for another conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1099)|
| 0:18:29| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| That's the kind of conversation where we're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| But I would like to get everybody's perception of what the plan does, what, and we'll talk about later, what force it might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| We could even have a discussion in terms of gatekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| Who has administrative responsibility for this plan doing what it needs to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Those are kind of big questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| I mean, early on we talked about, well, there's only three or four things that separate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| But that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| But you still have this overarching question right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| What's the plan do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| What's kind of the force of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| And what's the administrative or gatekeeping kind of tools within that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| I mean, that's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Tony, want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Yeah, I do have a comment about relative to this tact that we're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| As I look at the agenda, first of all, I mean, the agenda came out a couple of hours before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| And I think it was a point within our meeting to have an agenda with a significant amount of time before the meeting so we could review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1169)|
| 0:19:39| That would be my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| And then the other item, I mean, to me what we're regressing into an area and discussing some things that we're way past in terms of foundation for what this meeting is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1183)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Our meeting, we agreed before we employed you that we were going to get into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| and we were going to figure out where the points of disagreement were within the plan, not whether the plan is actually applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1209)|
| 0:20:19| But I thought that's what we were going to meet about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| And so that's what I'm a little bit concerned about the structure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| It looks like when are we going to get to the sticking points, which that's what this body, these two bodies agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| That's the only reason why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| That's what we said when we started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Doctor, want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Can I add just one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| I think maybe down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| There may have been a light on before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Mr. Gree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Let me just all back up for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| I think maybe there's some misconception about both of this group's involvement in this plan to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| Neither one of these two groups, with the exception of one or two who might have been on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| had anything at all to do with putting it together, what's in it, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| When it came to county commission, we did not have a chance to discuss any sticking point of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| There was a lot of stuff said, but there was no discussion of what we had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| Vote it up, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| That was our only choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Nobody here is an expert, as Chris pointed out, as far as what is in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| And basically, we know what it's supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| And we know some of the points that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| I'm like Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| I think that's where we feel like that we need to be spending our time on what are these differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| and what can we do to mediate the difference between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| And that's where we're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| But I want to make sure you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Doc?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| That was sort of the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| What I was going to make is really just reinforcing what both Tony, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| Tony said and what was just said by Mike down there is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| what I would have conceived or what I would have foreseen we doing is sort of having the charts like you have up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| And you could put a couple of them up there, you know, ask some of the people maybe in the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| what are three things you don't like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| We're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| And then we would just have to hash those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| And some of them are pretty technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| On the part, particularly, of the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| And some of them are, you know, maybe pretty technical on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| what some of the people would like to see in the green space and how that's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| But still, and then have people who, you know, are very interested in protecting property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| where we're not devaluing someone's property by putting restrictions on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| and hoping that the end result when you put all of this together is something that everybody could live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| And that was just the point I was going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| So I hear pretty clearly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Anybody want to respond to that, have a different impression before I kind of move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| If I could say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| I have a very simple mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| And so I'm not really into the technical things, but I'm kind of a bottom line kind of person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| To me, the bottom line is, what does the plan really do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| I mean, we've heard all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| And, you know, Commissioner Briggs very accurately described the both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Okay, what does it really do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| And that's one of the things that excited me when you said last week, let's look at the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| You can have your own opinions, but you can't have your own facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| So what does the plan really do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| And then does it create this mega MPC superhero superpower organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| that's going to go in and take everybody's land, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Does it really do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| So I guess I have these questions of what does the plan really do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| And looking at the law and looking at the legality of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| those are some of the things that I would like to have answered as we move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Yes, I want to talk about the sticky points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| but I also want to talk about these things that are swirling out there about the role of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| What role does it give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| It's my understanding that this plan is a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| that we're not going to be giving these people these powers until we give them that through ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| So, again, that's just my perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| I would like to have these things answered as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| because as we talk about the sticky points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| are we going to need to do them by ordinance or by resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| How do we go about this if we even want to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| So I guess to sum it all up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| I'd just kind of like to get to a bottom line of this as we begin to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| what does this plan really do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Is it just a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Does it become law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| I mean, what is it so that I understand it and others understand it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| but also what is the role of MPC in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Because I think that's a crucial question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| And what I want to tell you, we want to address both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| What I planned to do tonight was begin to address that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| the larger question of how does this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| and we're going to have to ask your legal counsel how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| What's the role of MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| And once we work through that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| then the last two sessions, if we end up with that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| start dealing with those particular sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| But from my understanding with conversations from you and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| then unless we deal with that larger gorilla in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| it becomes a little bit of a moot point to just work on the sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| And that's what we wanted to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| And I do have the question in terms I may at least mention to counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| we may want to need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| You know, this has been going on, the general plan is, what, 10 years old, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| And then this current plan has been worked on for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Is there anything going on in terms of statute or state law that impacts this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| Are you guys aware of that, or do you need to research that or talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| No, in terms of any evolving legislation that may nullify the efforts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Not aware of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Are there any statutes that would have any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| give us any kind of instructive look on the role of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| or the role of who's in charge of ordinance or things along that line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Tennessee Code annotated outlines specificity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| the formation of a regional planning council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| and it was promulgated and formed in accordance with Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| And a recent change in the Tennessee statutes last year read that the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| at least in terms of the county, I won't speak for a municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| I'll defer to my colleague with the city on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| But in terms of a county entity relative to land use and planning and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| the county commission is the final determinant of authority, and that is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| It used to be MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| It is now the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| If you want to know about municipal law, my colleague to my left, your right, can certainly jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| Well, I wouldn't disagree with Joe other than the fact that while the county legislative authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1631)|
| 0:27:21| I mean the city legislative authority is the ultimate body to determine what the law will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| with regard to zoning issues in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| you do have provisions within your charter that say that you are obligated to follow the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| And so if you have an amendment to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| which is I understand what this is proposed to be, an amendment to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| then you will be obligated under the city charter to follow the specific provisions of that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| or otherwise to amend the specific provisions of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| There are ways to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| But what the charter provides that you must do is that your zoning decisions must be in conformity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| with whatever plan you have adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| And so you guys help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I'm no attorney, so I want to ask this question, see if you understand it this way, going back to Joe's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1694)|
| 0:28:23| Does the fact that the statement you said, the last statute says that the final authority for ordinance preparation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1703)|
| 0:28:34| is the legislative body, the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| That's what's been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Versus in the past it had been the NPC, it's now the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| In terms of zoning changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Zoning changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| And then again, even when you adopt a plan like this, it is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Now, you can presume that they'll be enabling legislation to enact it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| but that comes in the form of an ordinance to amend the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| which can differ if the commission decides ultimately this is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| However, we feel in enacting it we may need to tweak the ordinance in such a manner to kind of deviate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| because ultimately it more suits our long-range land use and planning goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| So let me pretend, won't have to pretend, let me be the most ignorant person in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| So what I hear you saying then is that if this plan is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| understand that you're not giving the complete power to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| for developable ordinances and implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| That's actually to be done through the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| I mean, certainly the NPC can propose an ordinance change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| but if the county commission rejects it, it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Marilyn, I saw yours, and I'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Yes, Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| So I have a question because what I heard is Mr. Jarrett and Mr. Swanson opine differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| and perhaps this is a difference in law between the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| But what I heard, and please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| what I heard Mr. Jarrett say is that this is only a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| It's not law and the county commission would have to promulgate ordinances that affected the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| put it into action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| What I heard Mr. Swanson say in the city is that the plan is an amendment to the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| and that in the city charter we are bound to uphold the general plan and that is law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| And so the question is, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Is it a chicken or an egg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| I'm not sure whether we're engaging in semantics here or not, but I guess what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| I agree with the county law director to the extent that ultimately city council is the final arbiter of who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1844)|
| 0:30:56| of what your zoning code is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| But you do have a city charter that says when you have adopted, you have to adopt a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1859)|
| 0:31:08| And when you adopt a general plan, you've got to adopt a 15-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| you've got to adopt a one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| But whenever you have adopted a general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| all of your zoning decisions must be in conformity with that plan unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| and until you go back and change that general plan before you change an ordinance to be inconsistent with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1882)|
| 0:31:32| So adoption of this plan essentially affects all of our zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| I mean, there's a trickle-down effect in all of our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| Since you're not allowed to have a plan that's inconsistent with your zoning ordinance, I think the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| And so in terms of county, what I want to kind of summarize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| because I'm hearing this is what I'm trying to figure out in almost two approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| Do you agree with, in terms of county, does that have the same effect for county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I mean, you don't enact any – ideally, once you adopt the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| unless circumstances arise that you have to deviate from it, you do so by way of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| But with the county, it's not – in other words, if this was passed, it's not like that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| I don't declare it as law, and your ordinance is merely perfunctory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| That's the distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Because, again, we're a charter form of government, so it's just a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| There's distinctions between the municipal law, municipal charter, county law, county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| This is about as clear as mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| So what I'm hearing, to paraphrase, is that this will be a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| and it is not enforceable until the ordinances to fulfill that plan are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1971)|
| 0:33:02| So this – it just doesn't make a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| I mean, is this the same for both, where these ordinances are going to have to be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| can the plan be adopted before – I guess my question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| can the plan be adopted before all these ordinances are cut and dried and signed, sealed, and delivered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| Can you adopt a plan that does not have the power to back it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2006)|
| 0:33:37| Charles, would you like to, on the legal side, address that, or do you want us to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| My problem is I can only address it on the city side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| And this is a county commissioner who's asked the question, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Joe, did you actually hear his question there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Were you all in discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Would you restate for Joe your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| No, I mean, I think the bottom line is when this was first vetted, people were saying that this plan is law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| Now, ideally, you don't want to pass – or, you know, generally, when we pass zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| they should be in conformance with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| They should be, but if for some reason there is a necessity that they're not, in other words, they can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| So you can't presume that, okay, they adopted the plan, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| That's law, and any ordinance they pass has to be in direct conformity with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Or if it's illegal, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| I've got a follow-up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| So if we adopted the plan, both bodies could adopt it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2079)|
| 0:34:47| Then each one of these sticky points comes back in the form of an individual ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Then it automatically changes and is passed to whatever degree, up or down, not up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| but changed to benefit all, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| Then that becomes part – then that becomes the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| I want to confirm what I think I heard you say, because this is clear as mud to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| You're not the only one, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| So what I heard you say is that if tonight they pass that plan up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| then they came back and they had disagreements or they had sticking points that they worked through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| they could come back and pass an ordinance that amended or changed that plan to override that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Well, they would pass an ordinance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Pass an ordinance, which would then take precedent over the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| So if we pass a plan, then there's going to have to be some honeymoon period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2144)|
| 0:35:52| before it's enforced to allow these ordinances to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| Mr. Brown, why are we talking about ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| We're here to talk about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I don't know why we're talking about ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Because that's what it takes to make a change to a plan, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| I think where we're coming from, which can be appreciated, Tony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| is I think there's some confusion about even how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| And so we're trying to figure out, okay, if we – is this –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| because I'm telling you from my perspective coming in completely fresh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| I've heard multiple directions on what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| I've heard it described as this is legislation, this is law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| I've heard it described as this is a policy or a trellis or a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| And then – and so we're trying to – we want to make sure that everybody's clear what the role of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| so that as we move forward on those sticking points that we clarify what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| And so I think we don't want to get stuck on ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| but I do think it's important that that – handling that, you know, that we address those ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| That's a totally different process from what we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| We are in a – we're in a process of revision of a plan between these bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| We're getting into the legalities of whether – when we can do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| whether in the future that has an impact on ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Those are questions we do not need to be dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| I've got a question then going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Steve, can I just interrupt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| And, Chairman Hammond, you can jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| But we've asked you to facilitate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| We're using our lights, and we'd just like to go by the rule of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| We're trying to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| And that's the only way we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| So if we could just maintain some order here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Question, I want to come back before I go to Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Would you go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| I think we're really getting to the crux of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| And for me, and I think for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| is there's an understanding that when you talk about watersheds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| and when you talk about viewsheds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| you're talking about something that's a very organic whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| And I think that's the reason why the two bodies are sitting down together here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| And I'm hearing different interpretations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| as to how this would apply in the county and in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And that's a real concern for me because it feels ineffective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| or, worst case scenario, perhaps more restrictive in the city than in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| And I think we're all here together trying to look at this, again, as an organic whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| and it only makes sense to adopt it if we have an understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| that the way it's going to be promulgated is going to be the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| that there's going to be parallel tracks in both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| And if it's not, then I think that's the number one sticking point right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| You know, what Mr. Jarrett said was that if an ordinance comes before the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| what I heard him say is that if an ordinance comes before the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| and it's not in compliance with the plan, well, then you go and amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| And my understanding is, you know, you have the general plan and that's the umbrella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| and then you work down from there rather than from the bottom up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| And so we've got to figure out which set of rules has primacy to even get our arms around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| Good. Good. Let's go back, yes, to Jeff. Did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| Yes. That was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| When we started this whole process, we were told that we could not deviate from the plan, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2363)|
| 0:39:32| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Then, through ordinances, we make the changes to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| What I'm hearing here is that the city is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| If they adopt the plan, then it's the plan, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| And then it would have to come, if anybody wanted to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| they would have to come for approval for a variance to the plan, and my understanding of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| And the only reason I ask this is because, like Commissioner Brown is saying, this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Because if your plan is automatically law and ours is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| we're going in two different directions trying to get the same plan to the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| So the ordinances are important in how we get to that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| and that's what we need to work through is how we're going to do this so that both sides can be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| and we're both on the same plan for the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| and it's not harmful for citizens or developers on both sides, no matter where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Before I come, we'll come back to Charles in just a second and go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| When they say, and we may need you guys to think, I don't want to put you on the spot, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| because you're having to think on your feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| And it may be that you guys need some time to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Do the attorneys see these as two different interpretations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| I don't know that I can possibly answer that question because my orientation has always been toward the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| I feel like I have some understanding of city charter and the municipal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| I don't really feel like I have an understanding of the county's charter and county law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| nor have I paid much attention to the cases as they come down when they relate to a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| and do not relate to a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| And so I feel inadequate to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| And maybe the better thing to do is to allow the lawyers to caucus on that issue and do some research together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| and find out the extent to which we are engaging in semantics on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| or whether there truly are substantive differences in law as how the current state law impacts the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2494)|
| 0:41:44| Sorry about my drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| What I just wanted to emphasize is that there seems to be the notion that this plan, if adopted, is law and it's over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2506)|
| 0:41:54| that it's not subject to amendment, that it has to be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| And generally, you know, under our charter, any amendments to the code should conform with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2519)|
| 0:42:08| However, if there is an infirmity, it gives us room to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| That's what I'm basically trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| I'm not saying that if you pass it, it's worthless anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| But likewise, I'm not saying if you pass it, that is rule of law and it's not subject to amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| We may be saying the same thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| I think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| What we're saying here is we have provisions of the law that say you can't adopt an ordinance that is inconsistent with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2546)|
| 0:42:39| But we don't have a law that says you can't adopt a plan that's inconsistent with an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| And that may be what we're up to a little bit here is looking at a plan that currently may be inconsistent with some ordinances that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| So if we adopt that plan, I think the advice you're going to get is while you can adopt that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| and you don't have to amend your ordinances first, but if you adopt that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| you're going to have to go back and you're going to have to bring your ordinances so that they are consistent with that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| and not have a continuing situation where your general plan has one set of rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| and your ordinances have a different set of rules and regulations, that would be terrible for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| And I don't think it's the way it's contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| I think Joe has said it just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| There's a period of time within which then we would have to go back and bring our ordinances into compliance with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| But if we don't do that, then we have to amend the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| because I don't think we're allowed to have on a continuing basis ordinances that are going to be inconsistent with what we've adopted as our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Anybody now? Go back to Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Did you want to say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Let me give you my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| And I've watched this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| And I'll invite both of the attorneys or anyone else to rather than let me have my say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| if I'm going off on the wrong track, to stop to get this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Because I think we're going to have to have a starting point, and it's got to be clear from the starting point what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| I agree with Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| This is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| What I would see if we adopt the plan, this is what the MPC takes when a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| or when someone comes to them saying that what you're proposing is either consistent with the plan or not consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2658)|
| 0:44:27| If it's consistent with the plan, the MPC will approve this, and it will either go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| and if there's no challenges, then the person can go ahead and do what he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| If it's not consistent with the plan, because there's places where a 15-degree slope may be completely inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2677)|
| 0:44:46| and there may be times where on a 40-degree slope or a 30-degree slope maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| you can have a plan that a developer comes up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| It won't be consistent with our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| The MPC would deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| He could bring it to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Even though the MPC may think it's a good plan, he could bring it to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| and then we could approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| What I see is this gives the MPC the guidelines about what we're doing, what we're not trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| and it doesn't mean that if what they're proposing is good that it can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| And the MPC may think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| It is appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| They may take something that's in the plan that's inappropriate that they would approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| but a homeowner's group could say, these are the reasons we think this is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| and rather than it being law, they could bring that to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| and give good reasons why even though it's consistent with the plan, it should be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| And then we compose our – and we do this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| We have general plans in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| We have sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| We have people who appeal those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| We have people who think these are right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Homeowner's group appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| We had that recently with a restaurant out in the area where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| and it was not consistent with the plan, but we changed things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| and there's good reasons because of traffic and other flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Even if it's consistent with the plan, we wouldn't want that project to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| And then later, this is what we're trying to do is have the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| and then later we can apply as many ordinances which takes away the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| because we can't change the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| And we can either add those to it or we cannot add those to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| to give it more teeth in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| We can have higher penalties for people who don't do what they're supposed to with erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| So what I hear you saying is that it's your understanding that if you pass this version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| some version of this plan, and then someone who wants to have something done goes to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| they will either approve it as per plan or they may disapprove it as per plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| And if someone doesn't like that disapproval, they can come to you at the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| Or if the person doesn't like the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Or the approval. They can come to you for whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| A homeowner may like, I mean, this may fall right within the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| but a homeowner group may say, look, we're going to build this, and it's going to cause erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| This is a very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| That comes to you then for you to make a regulatory decision about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| And then if we want to put certain ordinances in there on what penalties are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| if somebody does something wrong, even though they're right within the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| but they're not doing the right thing with erosion or handling stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| then we can put ordinances in there that have teeth, or we cannot put ordinances in there with teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| Absolutely. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| And that's where I see the overlay of ordinances with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| This is a plan that gives the MPC a structure to make their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Yes, sir, and then back over here to Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I think Dr. Briggs plowed a lot of the ground that I was thinking of, and that's why I turned my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Then I want to make a comment about then where we are if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| and I'm looking back now over the last three years, and I remember the restaurantees speaking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| whether Metropolitan Planning Commission approves or disapproves something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| and whether county commission, I'm a member of county commission, approves or disapproves something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2888)|
| 0:48:16| I think before we get started here that both organizations have to be working from the same rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2896)|
| 0:48:24| And you'll notice I didn't use the word plan or ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| We have to be coming from the same playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| It may be that MPC dealing with the plan says this proposal that a citizen has brought forward does not fit with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2912)|
| 0:48:47| so they deny or recommend denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| That comes to county commission, and we look at ordinance, and we're able to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| That's the way some people say the train runs or the system works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| or that's the way the crooked roads are built around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| The thing I don't like, though, is the Metropolitan Planning Commission working one way that we can overwrite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2948)|
| 0:49:18| I don't want us to be on different pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| I want us to be working from the same thing, headed in the same direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| Now, maybe what we're at here is a junction, and we've got a rough spot in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| but I don't think this rough spot, I don't believe it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| We have to be closer to looking at the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| When we look at a project, we need to be looking with the same corrected vision about what's there in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2981)|
| 0:49:52| I do not personally want commission dealing with ordinances that are different from Metropolitan Planning Commission's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| And I think that's something that, as Tony is talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| that's something that's coming before us right now that really hadn't been before us before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| the difference between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| And we haven't really plowed that before until right now tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| If they approve it at city council, then they're going to have to live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| I think that's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Well, we're going to let them come back in a week or two to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| I think their process, from what I understand them saying, is much like your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| They may have been using different semantics on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| But we need to let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| They need time to sit down and develop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| So let me then back up to what I think I'm hearing about the county is that Metropolitan Planning Commission would have a different plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| to make recommendations toward the ordinances that are standing right now before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3049)|
| 0:50:57| In other words, a citizen asking for something before MPC would be different than what we would approve as commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3057)|
| 0:51:10| And I don't think we can go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Is that what you guys understand where we are with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| I don't think that's where we are with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| I think if the plan gets adopted, I think we're saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| And, Joe, please tell me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| I've been wrong before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| It didn't kill me yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| But what I think we're saying is that if we adopt the same plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| MPC is going to follow that plan in terms of what they tell citizens they can do and what they can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| And also, if we adopt these plans to the extent that either body has ordinances which are inconsistent with the plan that we've just adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3105)|
| 0:51:55| then those bodies are going to be obligated to go back and change their ordinances so that they are, in fact, consistent with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3115)|
| 0:52:03| You're not going to have an ongoing situation where you have a plan that's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| and then ordinances that are inconsistent with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| That's just not the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| I don't think it works that way in the county either, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| So what we're saying is the plan would get amended first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| And if there are provisions of that plan that are inconsistent with the ordinances that are currently in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| over a fairly brief period of time, both legislative bodies would then take whatever action is necessary to amend their ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| to come into conformity with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| And if they didn't, then they'd have to go back and change the plan, and we'd have different plans for different jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3158)|
| 0:52:46| First I had Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| I want to get us out of the tall weeds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| We can get too technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| The bottom line for this group is that we want to work on a plan that fits and feels right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| It is, in a general sense, the umbrella we're working under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| And it started at MPC, at least in terms of its development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| But we're here now, and so we've got to get to the sticking points, get to the plan that's kind of shaped right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| The reality is there will be individual cases that come up, because it comes up in law all the time, that don't quite fit the mold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| and that's when you deal with them with separate ordinances and amendments and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| But right now, we're trying to help shape the citizen-based vision of their future in connection with hillsides and ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3209)|
| 0:53:37| and the things that relate to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| And so we've got to change the pieces that don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| And so where we're at, because we're on limited time tonight because a lot of people have to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| one of the reasons, and someone asked why we brought that up in my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| is I want to make sure this is kind of a big deal about who basically gatekeeps, how that's managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| Because I've heard multiple things from multiple sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| One source say they're giving all the power to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| They're basically allowing planning commission, I've been told this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| you're allowing planning commission to do basically ordinance and policy work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| But I hear from your council that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| And I want to clarify tonight that this, from what I hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| and I want you guys to have some time to think about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| and if it's different than what you've said tonight, you can let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| What I hear is there's this plan right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| and you guys can work through the sticking points of that plan and find out where you want to be on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| And then if that plan is put into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| MPC will then basically follow that plan, but they're not final arbiter of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3281)|
| 0:54:49| If someone doesn't like it, as the doctor said, if someone wants to amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| they have a right then to come back because according to statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| apparently in the past a planning commission could be the final arbiter, but not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| Is that correct, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| This situation was just recently litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| It went all the way to the federal courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| And this is what the federal courts have said in the most recent cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| It said the state legislation places the authority to plan and the authority to zone with the local government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3310)|
| 0:55:18| And then further in their ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| ruling that the county commission or city commission are the final determinative authority said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| local legislative bodies may enact zoning plans recommended by planning commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| but they are not obligated to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| So there's no doubt in the law who's in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| That's what I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| The point of this shorter meeting tonight was to clarify who the gatekeepers are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| who are the ones who manage that information because there has been, if you guys have imagined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| lots of different interpretation of that floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| So I want to make sure we're clear on that because where I want to end tonight is if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| and you guys are comfortable with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| we now have to move to what the doc and Tony and others were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| are those particular sticking points within that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| But unless we clarified exactly who's that final arbiter and how that takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| I think the discussion of sticking points can get stuck in the mud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| for some people who have concerns about how this is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Is that making sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Yes, sir, one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3379)|

| 0:56:22| Adopting a plan without these ordinances in place, to me, is just like buying a car with no motor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3382)|
| 0:56:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| One footnote point, and that is you were characterizing the concern about MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| What I have heard is slightly different than yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| If you throw all of the development work into a use on review type category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| it means you've got to go work with and lobby with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| The contrast to that was if you had a clear set of stated rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| then you could decide for yourself and they would have to follow the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| So the question was did you have to submit yourself to a discretionary body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| and maybe not get what you think you were bargaining for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| And that's where I think the argument is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| And that's where we're going to make the next step, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| One last comment I want to kind of bring to some conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| I don't want to take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I think it's absolutely critical that part of the final plan is that people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| no matter what side you're on, understand that they do have the right to appeal this to an elective legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| because you've got to remember the Metropolitan Planning Commission is appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| and they can't have the final authority because there's going to be accusations that whoever appoints that body is going to pack it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3462)|
| 0:57:52| It can be people on one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| You'll hear people say it's going to be packed with one interest or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| But there needs to be, I think the elected body needs to be the final arbitrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| And I think that both sides need to understand, because this was part of the misunderstanding that caused a lot of the hostility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| is that if there's a bad development, even though it fits the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| or there's a good development that doesn't fit the plan, they need to have the right to appeal that to an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| And I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| We're going to have a hard time getting people to accept this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| And that's the point of where we're going tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| I want to make sure that that's clear because, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| that isn't clear with at least the conversations I had with not everybody on this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| and some of the interest groups I've talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| So we want to clarify that, as the doctor said, that there is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| It's put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| The Metropolitan Planning Commission will implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| People have a right then, if they don't agree with that for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| to bring that before the elected body and have that amendment done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| That doesn't answer Nick's question, which is one of our later discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| is how do you flesh that out in terms of ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| Do you preview it, do you do it first, or do you do it later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| But I want to make sure it's clearly understood and goes on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| that the final arbitrator or elected body, not an appointed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| Is everybody understanding clear with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| Great. Yes, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| I want to make sure that I understood, and Mr. Swanson, I think, had made the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| So I want to, in my mind, if this plan is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| this plan will be used by the MPC for any citizen or developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| whomever comes before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| They will use this plan as guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| I believe I heard Mr. Swanson say that if we have ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| that are in conflict or not in agreement with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| I don't know if the word is obligated or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| but that we would come back and look at ordinances that would fit within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| So the notion, then, that this plan is just a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| and does not have force or teeth behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| it would seem to me that it does have teeth behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| because this is the document that will be used for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| If they don't like it, they can come back to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| We are the final arbiter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| But it would seem to me that if we approve this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| we would also want to approve ordinances if they're in conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| so that we would lessen the amount of conflict before the MPC and Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| I want to make sure that I'm fully understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| Joe, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| In my own mind, as we move forward, I want to make sure that I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| yes, this is a plan, but it will have teeth behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| that the MPC is going to be using this, and we may have to look at ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| I mean, that's kind of my bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| It is, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| But my concern was people run the impression that once you pass the plan, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| It's immutable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| You can't do anything about it, and that's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| You have a lot of broad discretionary authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| But to say it's just merely a worthless document is untrue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| That's the rule and guide they're going to use until they're advised otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| In the last 10 minutes or so, we're going to kind of tie some of this discussion up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| so you can get to your other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| But, Marilyn, did you have something you wanted to add to that on that topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I do, and I think, again, this is very central to our success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| because what we've heard is we pass this plan and then our bodies go our separate ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| and we each address our ordinances that are not in compliance to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| so that we come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| But if we come up against a wall with something that we don't like or doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| then we go back and amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| And then you get into this situation where you don't have agreement between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| And, again, I think this plan, because it deals with viewsheds and watersheds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| has got to be comprehensively consistent across both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| And so the point that Dr. Briggs makes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| that perhaps the ordinances need to come to both bodies at the same time that we're doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| so that we all know that we're all enforcing and undertaking and supporting the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| because it just isn't going to work without consistency across both forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| So we may make it work, and as we talk further, because we've got to begin to tie this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| one of our process points will be that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| how do we go about handling that long-term interval process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| Does it come before both bodies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| How do we make those kind of decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| We want to put that on our map, because that's a discussion at a later date that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| I want to go to Tony, and then I'm going to turn the light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Yeah, and I absolutely agree, Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| But that should not deter us from the task at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Okay, that can be taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| That's part of my process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| And that process of, you know, the process of addressing ordinances and amending the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| or vice versa, whatever comes first later on, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| And we could commit to it being a bicameral effort, because it's got to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| It really has to be when we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| But I think that's well put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| I think we've done great work tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| You guys talked about, I mean, you talked about, whether we realize it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| you talked about the gorilla in the room tonight, which is how does this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| And the question is, who ends up making these final decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| There's a lot of misunderstanding about the role of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| how much power they would have, versus taking that kind of power away from elected bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| I think we're kind of clear how those decisions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Where we want you to think about in the next week is we need for you to start thinking about those sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3832)|
| 1:04:02| We need for you to be telling us where those sticking points are in terms of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| The most effective way to do that is for you guys to communicate that to me by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| Send to me, each one of you, just send me, here's my, some of you have done this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| but here's what we think the sticking points are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| We can gather those together rather than waste valuable time here trying to decide what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| We'll bring those up, ranked by the number of people who think that's a sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| We can begin working on that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| I know that some of you aren't policy wonks, and some of you may not have read this thing very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| I mean, it's a long document, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| And it might, I don't, here's an idea, and you guys let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Would it be helpful for you, and I'm going to pick on your legislative, your counsel again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| Would it be helpful for you if counsel pulled kind of the black letter law out from that legislative intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3891)|
| 1:05:00| There's a lot of legislative intent, legislative history in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| and there's also kind of the key black letter law legal points or the points of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| If we kind of pulled those out and had those available to you so that you didn't have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| and kind of sort those out, would that be helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| Is that something you guys could probably do relatively easy is pull those out for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| Mr. Swanson just said he'd love to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| I saw him waving his hand going, me, me, let me do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3924)|

| 1:05:32| And if we could get that to you by the middle of next week, Tuesday or Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| we'd get that out so that you had it, and then back to me by the following Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| of what you think the key points are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| We can gather that together and begin to work on those specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Tony and the doctor are talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Now we understand how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3948)|

| 1:05:56| I'll put steve.joiner at Lipscomb.edu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| L-I-P-S-C-O-M-B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| If I wrote UT, you all would know how to do that, but I work at Lipscomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| And so we'll get that to you by the middle of next week so you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| Here's kind of the black letter law separated out from more of the legislative intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| so you can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Talk about the sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Some of you have done this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| We get that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3985)|

| 1:06:28| That's one of the problems with the length tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| We can work on those sticking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| But I thought it was essential that tonight we have the discussion that Mike asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| Exactly what does this do and how does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| And that everybody understands that in this particular plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| the final decision still ends up in legislative hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Sorry, we didn't meet the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Meet the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4018)|

| 1:07:06| so I have a week before the 18th to put that together for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| It's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| We're together for the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Any other questions before I tie up my end of it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4038)|

| 1:07:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| To go back to what Tony said earlier, if we could have the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| You'll have it much earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| And then the other question I have, the sticking points that you talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| you've said that you talk to different interest groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Are these sticking points only going to be coming from commission and city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| The sticking points that will be working are commission and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Because I want to clarify, you're my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| I listen to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| I teased one particular group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| I said, you're somewhat like grandparents at a child custody hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| You know, you're well-dressed and you're well-educated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| but I'm still working with the girl in the flip-flops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| That's you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| But anyway, but in a teasing way, that I'm part of, you know, I'm here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| We're listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| But I also understand that the things I'm hearing from the interest groups are also the same things you're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| I'm assuming you've heard those same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| So that's informative for me, but I don't carry anyone's interest up here but yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4102)|

| 1:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110804hillsideprotection?start=4113)|
