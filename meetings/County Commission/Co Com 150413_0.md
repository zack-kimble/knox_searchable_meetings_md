| 0:00:25| All right, members, we have tonight before us one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=25)|
| 0:00:30| Is there anyone that you all would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| like to hear from as candidates again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| Or do you all have any questions of any of the candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=37)|
| 0:00:43| Any of the candidates wish to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=43)|
| 0:00:45| Or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| All right, what we'll do is we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| We'll do nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| Just explaining for those that are in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| are not aware, or those watching are not aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| we'll take nominations from each commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| And at that point, nominations will cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| We will go around a voting, a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| And then we will also, if no one gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| six votes on the first turn, the lowest vote totals drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| And we do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=75)|
| 0:01:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| My light's not working currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| So before we start, I just like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| I don't think there's any secret about my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| with this process, or lack of a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| or lack of a framework by which we were given the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| And I'd equate it to baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=99)|
| 0:01:46| Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb, those guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| they were great, outstanding players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| But a lot of people feel that they played on a tainted field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| because they weren't allowed to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| with the Joss Gibsons and Healthy Societal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Pages of the World.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| And it's just, let's put everyone out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| on the field at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| And the best man, best woman wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Again, it's not a disparagement toward Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| or those great players, because they were that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| But if we're really going to do what's best for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| do the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| So I just strongly, strongly feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| that this was a flawed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| And I hope that it never happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| So my message to the judges is, write down something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| Give us something to tell us what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Since this is a public process, that's why we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| that's why the commission is involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| because they want a public vetting of these magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| And that just did not happen this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| So it's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Yeah, just quickly, one way I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| we're going to go through here, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| going to vote right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| I would really, all these people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| we don't have to nominate anybody or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| We got to nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=194)|
| 0:03:14| Yeah, we got to go around and make the nominations first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Well, I hope they all are nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| It's my hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| So we'll start in the first district with nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=202)|

| 0:03:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=213)|
| 0:03:33| I was like, man, her voice has gotten a lot deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=213)|

| 0:03:48| been down in the office doing the most substitute work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=228)|

| 0:03:52| when they need a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| I talked to Mr. Brown after he retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| and he wanted me to point out that I reached out to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| that he didn't reach out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| And I asked him about this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| about the work they've been doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150413?start=245)|
