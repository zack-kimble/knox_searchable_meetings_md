| 0:02:13| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=133)|

| 0:02:39| Move for approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| Any opposed? The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| For the mayor's report, first, as Councilman Roberto referred to, today is the 17th anniversary of the 9-11 terror attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=167)|
| 0:02:56| So I wanted to take the opportunity to again thank our community's first responders for their bravery and their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=176)|
| 0:03:04| Our firefighters, EMS crews, police officers, and others prepare for the worst case scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| They're the first on the scene in emergencies, and they head toward danger when the rest of us run away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| This morning, we observed the 9-11 anniversary at two downtown commemorations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| First, we hosted a short ceremony at the 9-11 memorial located on the lawn of this building right outside our doors here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| and the bells of First Baptist Church tolled at 846 a.m. and at 903 a.m. to mark the times when hijackers crashed airliners into the World Trade Center towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=210)|
| 0:03:42| At the same time, the fifth annual Knoxville 9-11 memorial stair climb was held at the Suns Fair on the World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=222)|
| 0:03:50| and I appreciate Councilman Roberto and Vice Mayor Saunders joining me there this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| It was somber yet inspiring to watch first responders from the city and other area agencies as they climbed the equivalent of 110 stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=235)|
| 0:04:05| in remembrance of the 343 New York City firefighters who died at the Twin Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| We also remembered the first responders and volunteers who later died or now have debilitating health issues due to the toxicity at Ground Zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=251)|
| 0:04:21| as they conducted additional rescue and recovery efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| And we remembered the family and friends of the victims of the attacks who have lived this tragedy for 17 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| So again, I want to thank Knoxville's first responders for your willingness to serve and your commitment to keeping us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| And by the way, some of these first responders are now on their way to South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| and I wanted to ask Fire Chief Stan Sharp to give us an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| As you just said, our firefighters and first responders rush into danger when everyone else is leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| and that's exactly what's happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| We received a request from the state of South Carolina through the state of Tennessee to help with the upcoming hit from the hurricane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=302)|
| 0:05:15| Last night we sent one of our responders with what's called an AMBUS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| It's basically an ambulance bus that can transport people from hospitals and nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| He's already down there and assisted in an evacuation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| They're moving people from North Charleston to Greenville, South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| and we have a swift water team that is deploying in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| We have six of our people that will be headed down along with six people from Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| to assist with the flooding that we are expecting in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| So if you would keep them all in your thoughts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Thank you. We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| So council members, in a few minutes you'll be voting on a resolution expressing support for my appointments to the Mayor's Maker Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| The Mayor's Maker Council was set up in 2016 to serve as an advisory board to raise awareness of Knoxville's local maker movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=367)|
| 0:06:16| The Maker Council does a great job of touting the maker's economic contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| promoting local goods and services, and discussing how we can amend our policies and regulations to better assist maker businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| So the next Maker City Summit will be on Sunday, September 23rd at the Mill and Mine on Depot Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=389)|
| 0:06:38| The philosophy for the day-long event is making a living doing what you love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| and attendees will hear from keynote speakers and panelists on the joys and challenges of running a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| So for complete details and to get registered, visit http://themakercity.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=409)|
| 0:07:10| Okay, so next I want to recognize Boyce. Where's Boyce Evans? Please stand, Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| As council knows, and we sent a notice to the media not long ago, that we have a new Deputy Director of Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=436)|
| 0:07:25| It's actually a new position that we established a while back but had not yet filled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| And Boyce Evans, you all know him as the city's purchasing agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| He has been there since March of 2006, so more than about 12 and a half years with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| Following a career in the U.S. Army, in the Army he held finance positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| including a stint as the finance director for Fort Campbell, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| where he was responsible for a $271 million budget, and he retired as a lieutenant colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| With this promotion, his responsibilities will continue to oversee the purchasing division, which is a part of finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| and he'll also focus on the budget, and we're moving to a new budget software system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| And he'll work with Jim, with our senior director of finance, Jim York, which is somewhere, who's also here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| Oh, he's behind Boyce. I see a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| As you all know, Jim, who's also been with the city for 20-some years, I can't see his face so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=506)|
| 0:08:36| But how many years? 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| He will be retiring in about the same time I'm out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Some of us are going out of office after a long, stellar career with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| And so part of Boyce's duty as deputy director is to do a brain dump on Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| because he knows, he's forgotten more than we'll ever know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| What's that song, Country Song, how does that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| So Boyce will be working with Jim to really get his arms around the system as deputy director in preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=541)|
| 0:09:10| When a new mayor comes in after I'm gone, then that mayor will have a choice of who to select for their director of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| But we will have somebody in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Or if Jim decides to head out early, which we don't recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| we'll have somebody who understands the finance department and can work with the rest of the team there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| We have a really strong team there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| So congratulations, Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| So the next public meeting on the Urban Wilderness Gateway Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| will be held Tuesday, September 18th at 6 p.m. at South Doyle Middle School Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| The design team will be reporting back its latest work based on all the feedback gathered through online surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| a series of small group meetings with neighborhoods and community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| and the public input exhibition and block party, which was held last June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Also, everyone is invited to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Knoxville's Police Advisory and Review Committee, or PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| That celebration will be on Friday, September 21st at 4 p.m. in the small assembly room of the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| As you all know, PARC was and continues to be a model initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| to help improve relations between Knoxville residents and the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| and to provide an independent review by citizens of police activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| and then to make recommendations to the police chief and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| Our own Avis Reed, the city's senior director of community relations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| previously served on the board and then was PARC's second executive director for nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| And now, of course, Clarence Vaughn serves in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| So we invite everyone to join us on September 21st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| as we reflect on the great work of PARC's board and staff over the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| And that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Any reports from council? Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| This Sunday, the 16th Westwood Park is 25 years old, and we are celebrating that beginning at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=667)|
| 0:11:15| It's on Heron Drive in Westwood, which is at the western end of Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| I would invite everybody to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| It'll be a nice celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| It's a beautiful little park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| It's right behind Bearden Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Westwood Park, 25th anniversary, Sunday the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=688)|

| 0:11:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| I just wanted to acknowledge Laura Catola, who's in the audience, from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=696)|

| 0:11:49| the class of 2018 and 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| So I want to thank you all for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=711)|

| 0:11:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| I was hoping you were going to make the announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| We have a Recode public workshop next Thursday, the 20th, at 530 in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| for everybody to come out and continue to offer their comments about Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Okay, we will continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| 8A is a resolution expressing support for the Mayor's appointments of Kelly Jolly, Ryan Ashley Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=738)|

| 0:12:34| Melissa Maddox, and reappointments of Terrence Carter, Matthew Cummings, Preston Faribault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| Sherry Jenkins, Doug Laney, Sarah Shavaro, and Brent Thompson to the Mayor's Maker Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| That's an old light. Is that right? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| So we have a Mayor's Maker Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| 9A is an ordinance to modify the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 17, Article 6, Section 17-354, relating to commercial loading zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=786)|
| 0:13:17| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| 9B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 20, Article 1, Section 20-52 of the Knoxville City Code to revise the definition of vehicle and to add a new definition of bicycle for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=805)|
| 0:13:37| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Councilwoman Singh Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Hi, I just have a couple questions on that definition compared to further down in the agenda where we have the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| I wanted to know what the difference between those vehicles were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| I don't know that there's a difference in the definitions. It's really a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| We're really talking about the scooters and the bicycles with regard to the moratorium where the business model is to dump them in the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=842)|
| 0:14:12| and then allow people to use them and then charge fees for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| This is really with regard to coming into compliance with state law with regard to the definition of bicycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| so that our bicycles can be utilized in our greenways and parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| It just includes a trailer, like if you want to ride your bicycle in the park and trailer your baby behind you and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=867)|
| 0:14:37| It allows you to do that, which the current definition does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| It just changes the definition so as to permit those things and to come into compliance with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| as it currently exists with regard to the definition of those vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| And motorized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| It includes the motorized aspect of the bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| It wouldn't be the same as a motorcycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| It has to do with how much power there is related to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| But this would just be for the low power motor assisted bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| Okay, so any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| Authorizing the mayor to enter into a development agreement with Knoxville Science Museum Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| and the Clayton Family Foundation to purchase and develop certain real property located on or near 800 Baker Jr. Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| and Zero East Hill Avenue so as to construct a state-of-the-art, world-class educational science center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| known as the Knoxville Science Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Okay, we have a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| We have three people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| What would you like to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Would you like to hear from the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| I'd like to hear from the speakers first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| First, before we do that, I do want to recognize that Mr. Clayton is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| We appreciate you being here and all of your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Looking forward to having a good discussion about this and a vote on this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| There may be questions of you from council later or from your team, but thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| Okay, we'll start with those who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| There are three people signed up to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| The first is Louise Seamster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you, Ms. Seamster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Please state your name and address for the record, and if you watch the timer up here, you'll have up to five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| My name is Dr. Louise Seamster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| My address is 1410 Granger Avenue in District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| I'm a postdoctoral teaching associate at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in sociology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| I study politics and development in cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| I'm also a member of the city council movement, although tonight I'm speaking as myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| and not as a member of any of these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| and I'm here tonight asking council to vote no on Resolution 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| In the 1950s, Robert Merton developed the idea of the Matthew effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| and he drew for this on the Bible verse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| to he that hath, more shall be given, but from he that hath not, more shall be taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| And I think about this phrase a lot as I study urban development proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| So many times we're asked to give public resources and assets to already wealthy private actors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| the people who already have the most in our society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| and in many, many cases, the thing we are giving to the best off among us comes from those who are worst off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| The land in question in this resolution is part of the Mountain View Urban Renewal Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| or as I've learned people call it here, urban removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| In the 1960s, Knoxville took vibrant black neighborhoods and raised them to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| They changed the landscape so much that elders cannot even identify landmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| when they talk about their homes, schools, and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| They built the James White Parkway, the Coliseum, the parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| and the police headquarters on this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| I sent my students to observe urban renewal sites this past semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| and they were truly shocked thinking about what had been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Knoxville was not alone in caring about urban renewal projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| It was a national initiative, and the scholar Mindy Fullilove says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| 1,600 black neighborhoods were destroyed just under this one program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| She talks about how this destruction has created intergenerational trauma on whole communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| From my observations, this is very true in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| People and neighborhoods have still not recovered from the destruction of Mountain View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| So the Science Museum proposal has many layers to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| but every layer is a story of the Matthew Effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| It appears to me that the city is being asked to pay a heavy cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| for the supposed gift of a science museum by Jim Clayton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| and the brunt of that cost would be paid by black neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| That was true when the proposal was to relocate the police headquarters in Knoxville College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| and it will be true in any case if the Science Museum is built here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| The creation of a museum in this location, as many new apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| have been built right to the east of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| promises to extend the displacement of urban renewal further east to Morningside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Moreover, there is no agreement over where to locate the police headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| if Clayton's Science Museum displaces it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| It appears the cart is driving the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| and if the council votes yes on this resolution tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| it is not only giving away stolen land, it is also creating new problems that don't yet exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| The logic that a museum must be in this specific location is being taken for granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| because someone with economic and political power has asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| In the spaces in which these plans are usually discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| I don't doubt there's unanimous support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| After all, he that hath is getting more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| And I'd ask whose voices are being heard in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| and whose timeline is being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| I want to be able to tell my students that on this one occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| a city did the right thing and thought better of serial displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Next, we have Barbara Bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1193)|
| 0:20:07| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Please state your name and address for the record and watch the timer up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Yeah, my name is Barbara Bridges, and I'm at 4536 Everwood Oak Lane, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| I agree with everything Louise just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| that we're really putting the cart before the horse in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| I read through the development agreement today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| and there are a whole lot of unanswered questions and decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| that are being put off into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| For example, we don't really know how much the public improvements are going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| and there's no agreement of whose responsibility those are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| I mean, it does allow for a public improvement agreement in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| but that's kind of important to know how much of the site improvements are going to fall on the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| And that's just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| We still don't know where the police headquarters is going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| and when this project was first unveiled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| we were told the police headquarters has to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| We have to, you know, as a kind of a pretext for putting the police headquarters somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| And now this agreement says maybe the police headquarters has to be moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| and maybe it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| We don't know yet, but at some point in the future, that determination is going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| So that's another important thing to know before you enter into this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| The development agreement says that the KSM is going to revitalize the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1304)|
| 0:21:55| but there's not really any explanation of what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| Does that mean it's going to push out the low-income folks and make room for wealthier taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1321)|
| 0:22:09| I would really like to know what either of the parties think it means for that neighborhood to be revitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1329)|
| 0:22:19| I would like to ask that the city have some sort of a community benefits agreement to do just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| to quantify how is this development actually going to benefit the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1348)|
| 0:22:41| The content of this exhibit is also a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| I don't mean any disrespect to Mr. Clayton, whose offer is very generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| $150 million is a lot of money, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| But I don't know if Mr. Clayton or any of the Clayton family believe in anthropogenic climate change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1377)|
| 0:23:07| and that's kind of important if you're giving the keys to the city for them to build a science museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| I would like to know who's going to be in charge of the type of science that's going to be promoted in that museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1393)|
| 0:23:24| and what are the performance measures going to be for how this science museum is going to benefit citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1404)|
| 0:23:37| There's nothing in this development agreement that requires the building to be LEED certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1417)|
| 0:23:47| and I would think that if the city's going to build a $150 million science museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| we should at the very least require that it be LEED certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| So I would request that that's added as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Also on page 7 of the development agreement, section A2, it says that when the developer gets the proposal to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1443)|
| 0:24:20| the city has 15 days to review it and 20 days to submit written comments and revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| 20 days is not enough to look at the proposal because that's where I'm assuming all of these unanswered questions are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| 20 days is not enough for there to be any sort of public comment period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| or for people in the community to even be made aware that the proposal's available, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| So I would ask that that review and comment period for revisions to the proposal be extended to 60 days at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1489)|
| 0:25:00| so that there's adequate community oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| And the last thing, with my last six seconds, is to just reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| that land was seized through eminent domain from the African American community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| and in my opinion, it still belongs to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| They have the right to determine how that land is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Next, we have Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1526)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you. Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| David Hayes, 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| All right, so first off, I'd like to say shout out to the students in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| I think it's cool when young folks get in here and actually try to see what the political process is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| Take some notes because we're about to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| So I think one of the biggest reasons why I'm here tonight is because there's a fundamental flaw in how our government is actually working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1556)|
| 0:26:04| There's a fundamental flaw in how Mayor Rojero's administration, administrations past, county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1564)|
| 0:26:13| most of all, not all levels of government, there's a fundamental flaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| and that flaw is that people can't actually participate and decide in decisions and processes that impact their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| People don't actually have a voice in what is going on around them and what is shaping their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| And I'm not a superficial voice to where, like, yeah, we heard you, but a voice that says, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| whatever the community says and decides, that's actually setting the bar and the standard for what the city is actually going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| That doesn't exist. It hasn't existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| So in this sort of situation, it allows sins and injustices to continue to perpetuate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Urban renewal, one of the greatest sins that we have in Knoxville, especially over the last few decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1608)|
| 0:26:57| To look at that land and not see the injustice of having a police station, condos that aren't affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1617)|
| 0:27:07| all these things that are relatively new, over the fossils of a black community that was forcefully taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1627)|
| 0:27:16| a community that was actually thriving, a community that was strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| We have this perception of black communities decades ago that they were all weak and just struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Yeah, we've always struggled, but we've also been strong, had strong community, had strong businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| had mechanisms to create strong social relations. Taking land eliminates a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1648)|
| 0:27:36| The people in that area, especially folks in Town View, the people in the bricks, folks on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| folks who are struggling day to day, or folks who maybe not be super struggling, but still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| they don't have the safety and they don't have the comfort knowing that they can actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| if tragedy or something happens in their lives, they can actually handle it and keep on moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| A lot of people, one crisis is away from homelessness, or one crisis away from an even deeper crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| These folks who live in this area, who are seeing condos built around them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| who are seeing lands taken up around them by developers, who have no input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| who have had no input historically or today, these are the people who we must center right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| These are the folks who should have an impact in whether or not this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| We have to have a shift that prioritizes the people over developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| Now, this isn't just about Clayton as a person, not as an individual. I'm not coming at him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| But he, his voice, his political capital, his economic capital, that does not make him more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1718)|
| 0:28:46| or more worthy, more smart, better, or anything over the folks who currently live in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| the folks who live in Town View, the folks who live in East Knoxville, the folks I just described before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| The voice matters just as much. And if we're going to see anything built in these communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| we have to make sure folks are actually going to benefit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| What does it mean that we're having a science that will come in this area that's already being gentrified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| that we're seeing these high-cost condos and we're seeing the culture that used to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| it non-existent, and we're seeing that attack every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| What does it mean to put on an attraction that's going to put, that's going to be having, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| like thousands of folks coming in, all this revenue coming in, folks from outside town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| folks from West Knoxville, folks who aren't in the community, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| All these folks are going to be flocking in, and all of a sudden, we're going to see that property value increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| All of a sudden, what's happening in Town View, what's happening to the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| They're being threatened. What's happening to Austin Homes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| What's happening to all these apartments in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Because folks see it coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| You can't just continue to push and push and push and develop and develop and develop and expect folks not to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| Once we continue to see our neighbors and our communities pushed out for various reasons, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| especially just not being able to afford the place and tenants getting pushed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| we continue to see our folks getting pushed out, especially around the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| You putting this up without consulting anybody, without actually making a process accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1810)|
| 0:30:18| not just having some things occasionally, like, oh, we have some slideshows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| Oh, you can look it up. You can come to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Actually, no. The standard is you should go to the people and let them know and let them actually decide what's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| Now, I haven't seen any data that says how much it would cost to fix the current police station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| and add on to the police station to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Now, until that data is had to compare it to another folder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you, sir. Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| This is not a good look for y'all, and I advise y'all to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Okay, that's the end of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| I would like to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| You know, we can't change what happened on that site 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| None of us were there. None of us were responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| But we can decide that when there are major investments that will help people in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| we can decide where they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| And that's, you know, we happen to look at it differently than what you just heard from the speakers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| This is not the wealthy taking from the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| This is a person of wealth who is philanthropic and is giving a gift to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| And it will serve all of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| And we've talked to him about that, and he has pledged to serving all of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| This is an asset that he could put in many different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| We encouraged him to put it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| He's been recruited by others who have property to put it in other parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| We encouraged him to put it there because it is our belief that it adds value to that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1907)|
| 0:31:56| to the people who are there, that if it was built in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| then I believe these same individuals would come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| why are you putting everything west? Why don't we get a museum in our part of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| So that's my belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| And so I think this is a wonderful investment for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| for the neighborhood in which it is proposed to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| The cart is not driving the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| We have had plans for years to find a new location for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| That area that's the proposed site is a civic site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| It's a place where there's an auditorium and a coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| We always expected to move KPD from that site and use that for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| whether the expansion of the coliseum or some other civic asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| that would serve the community that it is in and the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| So I have to respectfully disagree with the statements that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| This is a gift from a very generous person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| and it is something that if we thought it wasn't good for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| we wouldn't accept the gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| You know, we've worked with the councilwoman of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| who believes it's of benefit to the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| and so we are proceeding forward, if you guys vote for this, if you support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| to work with Mr. Clayton and his folks to make this a reality to serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| And by the way, a science museum like this has also been talked about for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| And I think is Ellie here? Ellie Kittrell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you, Ellie, for being here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| I know she's with the Muse, and they do exciting and wonderful things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| and they are working as well with Mr. Clayton and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| and we appreciate the collaboration that's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| This is something that benefits our children, people of all ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| and will serve this community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| I'd like to speak last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| You want to speak last? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Yeah, well, thank you for your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| and I think this is a really good steward of the property that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| and it does belong to the city, and that's what our task is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| is to make sure that the city property is handled well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| and invested well going into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| So I applaud for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| David, Mr. Brace, and I talked briefly this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| and this contract has a lot of what-ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| It has a lot of if this happens, then this is going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| or if that doesn't happen, then this is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| There's a lot of variables in this contract, which is a little bit unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| and I'm trusting both the Clayton, based on their reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| and my limited knowledge of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| but basically on their reputation of longstanding in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| and David and the Mayor, that we're notified as these changes happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2099)|
| 0:35:07| and I'm sure all the variables that are in this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| they want it to work out exactly like they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| that you're going to come back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| and we're going to vote on this probably many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| So I think it was probably a pretty big endeavor to get this down to writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| and get it down to where at least most of the variables, as you know them today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| are stated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| In the end, we still have the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| I mean, it's still a lot up in the air, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| and there's a lot of decisions yet to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| and I think this council will be right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| and we'll know those agreements as they go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| So there is a good amount of trust all the way around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| and I think we have that kind of relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| and I think we have that with Mr. Clayton as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| So no questions particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I think I could find issues on about every page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I wish there was more time here or less time there or less variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| but I think in all in all they've done a really good job with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Councilwoman St. Croix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| I have one question about how much is the property worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Has that been assessed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| So there have been some preliminary appraisals of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| I think at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| and those original appraisals were for the KPD site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| and the parking area, those two parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| and I do not have that in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| but it was around $1.3 or $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| I think once the Clayton team determines specifically how much property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| and where the building will go, then the city will value that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| And so, again, if you look at a $150 million gift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| for about $1.3, $1.4 million in land value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| and it depends on the size of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| and we'll update that and reassess that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| that would be a very good return on investment on any scale you looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| This is a great deal of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| $150 million is about a quarter of the city budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| So, I mean, it's a lot of money we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| It is the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| I'm glad that we had the speakers tonight to talk about what was on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| I think the historic aspects are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| and I'm hoping that with the construction that there will be consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| of hiring minority or people who lived in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| and trying to give back to that community some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you for your comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| I think you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| This is a tremendous project for any city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| and it's great that it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| the overwhelming majority is being probably funded by the Clayton Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| so certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| And there's nothing really more public than a museum that's really there to teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| and inspire us all, so it's a very exciting project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| and I hope that it's top notch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| I think I may have shared some of the concerns Councilman Wallace had on the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| Some of the timeline issues did seem aggressive and tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| and so I was just going to ask, spoke to Mr. Brace a couple times about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| if he would just sort of go over some of those timeline metrics in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| just so we know how we came to where we are in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| So I think it's important to know that, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| the development of any agreement is a negotiation between both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| and so Mr. Clayton and his team are incredibly generous in this gift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| and so this agreement is really about Mr. Clayton and his team feeling confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| with a commitment from the city for the site, for the schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| he has an aggressive schedule, and for KPD relocating from that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| That's really the basis for this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| It's the start of a relationship, and it's going to give Mr. Clayton comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| to spend significant money now on the next step, so there are unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Before Mr. Clayton hires an owner's rep, before he hires an architect and civil engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| and he does geotechnical work on the site, that will quickly add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| His attorney is sitting behind him today, and I'm sure he's not here for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| and so the clock is now starting to tick on him spending resources and money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| and he wants a commitment from this body and from the city before he jumps into this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| He's ready to jump in and to dig in, and so the time commitments are a reflection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| of the commitment to the site, the schedule, and to KPD relocating from that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| I know the one concern you had was about the section that talked about KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| potentially needing to relocate within 365 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Again, this is tied to that desire for the Clayton team to feel that the city agrees with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| and understands their aggressive schedule, and so we don't know if that will have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| That is an unknown until Mr. Clayton gets under contract, his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| and starts to dig into the site and starts to do programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| which really lays the template for the overall design of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| and then does schematic design on the building scale and form and where it will be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| And so what we have committed in this agreement, what the agreement commits to, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| is that if Mr. Clayton says he wants to put it right near or on top of the existing KPD facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2456)|
| 0:41:04| that we will get out in 365 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| And so he wants that type of commitment. We're not sure where it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| And Mr. Clayton wants some acknowledgement from the city that we are ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| Let me also say that KPD right now is fractured. There are multiple locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| There are about 60,000 to 65,000 square feet at the current antiquated facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| The elevator broke last week. It's a significantly expensive cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| so right now they're hoofing it up the stairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| The facility has about 150 employees, so it's not the entire force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| It's not 500-plus employees. There are offices there in about 60,000 to 65,000 usable square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| And so the ability to relocate that is manageable. We would prefer not to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| and I have communicated that to Mr. Clayton and to Ms. Brown and to his attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| and to our attorneys that we absolutely prefer not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| But for a $150 million commitment, this agreement says we're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| And so this agreement really starts to lay the groundwork for how this project will take shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| and hopefully I've answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| Thank you. I do appreciate your time working with me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| In terms of going forward, I think we'll support it. It's a tremendous project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| but I think it also puts a lot of pressure on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| And thinking about what was there prior to urban renewal, it was city grid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| and it was part of the city. It was very walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| Urban renewal changed that to a very car-centric area that feels really disconnected from everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2564)|
| 0:42:53| And I think the challenge is on the city and this project to really try to integrate that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| and connect it to other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| So this is an exciting project, and I look forward to supporting it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you. Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Thank you. First I want to thank the people that stood up and spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| to share your opinions on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| I think it is critically important that not only we know the history of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| but that we don't forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| With that said, I can only imagine for families who were affected by urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2608)|
| 0:43:36| when a police station and then a jail was placed on that property where families once lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| I can only imagine how heartbreaking that must have felt to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| But today we can't do anything. We can't change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| There's a police station that sits there now, a public safety building that sits there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| that is going to be moved whether or not this museum happens in that location or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| I feel that it is time that we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| I feel that the museum will be a benefit to the children in our inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| who are majority African American of diverse cultures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| as well as to the children across our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| I think it is a huge investment in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| That will be a benefit that will sit in the middle of affordable and mixed income housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| that already exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| This museum in no shape, form or fashion do I see that any families will be displaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| as a result of the museum going on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| And again, I think that it will benefit our children, not only of this generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| but future generations to come and will be a gift that continues to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| And so today I want to personally thank the Clayton Family and Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| for choosing this location and in the inner city to place this state-of-the-art museum, science museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| Because I know that you could have placed it anywhere, not only in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| but surrounding counties would have welcomed a project of this magnitude and your generosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| And so I thank you for investing in our inner city. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| Okay. Any other comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| Are you ready to vote? We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2725)|

| 0:48:04| Hi. I just wondered what the state of the dock was at this point. Does it need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| It needs to be replaced. Yeah, it does. It needs to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| It gets heavy use from those large vessels, especially during UT games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| And so TWRA has reached out. There is a match. But TWRA is funding the vast majority of this, the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2897)|
| 0:48:25| 25%? Yeah. But it does need to be replaced, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| And who all uses the Vol Navy dock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| It is open to anyone that wants to pull up to the Vol Navy dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| So a person with a boat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| A person with a boat, a kayak, a canoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| I would need to check with law on water regulations and laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| but I believe anyone that wants to pull up to that dock, swim up to it, water fowl are routinely on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| would be able to use that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| My understanding is it is not closed to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| TWRA requires that it be open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| I regularly see people fishing off that dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Fishing on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Okay. That's feeling better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| This is just one of the places where it feels like we give utilities to people who already have plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=2946)|

| 0:50:50| I would just encourage you to add some language that it does need to meet all four, not just any of the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3050)|

| 0:52:22| One person has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Mr. Britt, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Please, again, state your name and address for the record and watch the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Keith Britt, 558 Holton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| I'd like to talk about just two issues, and I will keep it under five minutes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| First, the good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| The Urban Wilderness Gateway project is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| I've looked over the details of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| I'm very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Having visited the High Line in New York City shortly after it opened and just watching how that project has progressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| I think it's probably going to be a tipping point for Knoxville in terms of making it a tourist destination instead of just a tourist pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3174)|
| 0:53:03| The one thing I would like you to consider is how that's going to tie into, I won't call it a crisis, but our housing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3183)|
| 0:53:13| I think that can integrate affordable, accessible, and even desirable housing into that plan with the surrounding communities where I think they need it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3193)|
| 0:53:25| So that's the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| The bad is the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| I know we've got a project next week, but I would like to make a high-level general comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3210)|
| 0:53:40| I want this recode to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| I see the need for this recode to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| But we need to slow down, and we need to back this up with facts and demonstratable analytics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3225)|
| 0:53:54| What we're basing or what we're being told that the recode is based on right now are personal anecdotes from neighborhoods and cities that look nothing like the communities we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3234)|
| 0:54:07| You don't get a warm fuzzy when somebody says, it's going to work out well because when I sold my house eight years ago, it worked for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3247)|
| 0:54:15| We're being fed a narrative, and I don't think this is intentional, but we're being fed a narrative that maintaining the integrity of our neighborhoods and supporting affordable housing somehow conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3255)|
| 0:54:32| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| We can do both of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| We shouldn't be told that we need to sacrifice one for another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| I've looked over the affordable housing plans from minority and impoverished community organizations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3278)|
| 0:54:47| They do not conflict with any of our established neighborhoods' plans to maintain their property values and character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3287)|
| 0:54:55| We can do both those things, and we shouldn't be told that we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| Yeah, and so just lastly, I know several of you on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| I respect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| I know you're good people, and I really do trust that you're trying to do the best thing with this recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| I talked to you about this, and I know you're trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| People that in my community aren't working with that same luxury of trust that I have in you, and so I would encourage you to get out and talk to us and explain to us why we need this recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3317)|
| 0:55:28| because a lot of people right now are assuming that this process is being driven by property investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| I know that's not true, but that's the impression that we're getting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Okay, council, that is the end of the agenda, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180911?start=3341)|
