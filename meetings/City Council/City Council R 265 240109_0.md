| 0:15:08| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| I believe that Mr. Knott, Cameron's husband, is here and we are so grateful for your willingness to attend and would like to give you the floor to speak a little bit about Cameron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=911)|
| 0:15:33| Thank you, Council, for this wonderful resolution, and especially Councilman Roberto for giving it legs and pushing me through to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=933)|
| 0:15:43| This resolution, the lovely comments that people have said, and anything I say within five minutes can't even express the impact that Cameron's life had on the Knoxville community and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=943)|
| 0:15:58| I'm sure many people here have stories about their adventures with Cameron Brooks, and some of which should not be told on public record, so I'll just leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=958)|
| 0:16:10| I wanted to also express my thanks to my family and friends, some who are on council who have helped us through this very brief yet difficult struggle called lymphoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=970)|
| 0:16:22| I've met a lot of people in his political circles and whatnot that I didn't know very well, but they were there immediately whenever I needed them to be there to help out the guy that helped out so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=982)|
| 0:16:40| I especially want to thank his brother, and now mine, Aaron, who came down so many times at the last minute from Bristol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| A quick trip when I was needing his help immediately, he was always there for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| And finally, I just want to thank Cameron for picking me to be his best friend, his soulmate, his co-parent, and his husband. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1013)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| This is a tough resolution, I think, because Cameron was taken away from us way too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1036)|
| 0:17:26| He was only 45 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| His celebration of life was really beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| It was attended by so many friends, and I think that we probably set a record for the most number of people assembled in Knoxville who were wearing Raiders gear at any one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1052)|
| 0:17:44| Cameron had almost a 30-year record of being active in our local politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| He loved politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Wes just mentioned adventures with Cameron, and just by coincidence, on my social media, it popped up a memory today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1073)|
| 0:18:03| It was today, nine years ago, that my brother, Cameron, and I drove in the motorcade with President Obama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| It's a strange occurrence that that's today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| That was such an amazing moment, and I remember him and I talking about that for years thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| Cameron is known as an advocate for the living wage and for campus workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| He served two years as the Knox County Democratic Party Chair, three terms as a Knox County Election Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1111)|
| 0:18:40| I really feel like Cameron loved politics because he loved people, and he wanted to do all the good he could do for all the people he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1120)|
| 0:18:51| I think that our community is a better place because of Cameron Brooks, and he will be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| I just want to say thank you to his friends and family who are here tonight, and just express my condolences for the loss of our friend and your family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1137)|
| 0:19:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| Thank you, Mayor, and I just want to echo Council Member Roberto's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| Cameron never met a stranger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| His personality, his spirit was just so fun and warm and inviting to any and everyone that he met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1166)|
| 0:19:35| I'm sure there are several of us that are sitting around this podium today that Cameron was an advisor to at some point, professionally and personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1175)|
| 0:19:46| I loved his spirit and I loved his zeal for helping other people and for being politically active and wanting to always do the right thing for the right reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1186)|
| 0:19:57| And so, Wes, I just want to say to you and to Cameron's family and friends who are in the audience that he was loved greatly in this city, and he's truly missed, but he will never be forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1197)|
| 0:20:08| So thank you all so very much for sharing him with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Council Member Thomas and then Council Member Hesley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| Yes, I didn't know Cameron very well, but I knew of him mainly for his long, unfailing support of low-income wage earners, many without benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1219)|
| 0:20:31| I was getting to know him better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| I was looking forward to him, in whatever capacity, continuing to work for those causes he believed in, and he won't be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1234)|
| 0:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Council Member Hesley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Yes, I knew Cameron for well over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| Going back to the Living Wage Campaign, and then when they decided to form the Campus Workers, then they came to CWA, which I was local president at the time, that they wanted to affiliate with CWA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1251)|
| 0:21:04| And I knew from that point he was going to fight for organized labor and do amazing things in Knoxville and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| Knoxville and organized labor is better off for his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| His life was too short, but I think he leaves a legacy many of us are inspired by, and he leaves an unfinished lot that many of us here will do our best to keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1274)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| There's not a lot to add other than the sweet friendship that I built with Cameron was, funny enough, arguing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1292)|
| 0:21:45| He and I, those that know me and I think know Cameron, we both loved a good debate and kept each other sharper, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1305)|
| 0:21:56| And so he would often tell me, my goal is to keep you from being lazy or soft or too mild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| So he was passionate about the things he cared about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| He wasn't afraid to speak up for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| And he did the very hard thing that is very hard to do now, which is to maintain friendship through a lot of reoccurring disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1331)|
| 0:22:24| And that's so very, very, very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| And there's nobody I enjoyed calling to debate with out of the blue than Cameron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1347)|
| 0:22:35| And he's just a sweet spirit that I got a little bit of time with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| So I'm glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| And thank you for sharing him with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1363)|

| 0:22:51| Council Member Hesley, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Well, just wanted to add to Wes and to Cameron's family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| He was a real gift to the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| We are all shocked and deeply saddened by his death, and he will be remembered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| And I'm very grateful for everyone for putting together this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| It's one small way we can honor his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Seeing no further comments, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1400)|

| 0:25:50| Mr. Chalmers, can you provide a summary of kind of how this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1550)|

| 0:26:00| A lot of you are familiar with our projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| and a portion of the project involved some city right-of-way work around that project that happened later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| Our buildings are pretty close to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| and this came to our knowledge after the city work started where the sidewalks came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| In essence, there were some footers of our building that extended a couple inches to about four feet into the sidewalk area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| so just underneath the sidewalk on one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| As we dug into the reasons behind it, our contractor and our design team in the surveying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| there was some miscommunication on where those lines needed to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| and so what we've done is talk with them and implemented some new procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| and expectations from our end to make sure that that doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| We didn't like that this happened, and we worked with Tom and his team to resolve this as soon as we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| once we figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| So just so I'm clear, the surveyor got it wrong on the front end, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| It wasn't that the construction company ignored the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| I believe it was a phased survey miss, so when they first put the corners of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| and I think part of it is the road was not exactly straight lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| When they went back, they didn't realize that the underground portion of the footer would be underneath that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| if that makes sense, so they needed to come back and survey it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| I have some questions for Mr. Clabo, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| There's three sections included in this encroachment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| other than generally overstepping the property boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| Am I right that the main thing the city misses out on here is space for landscaping, trees, and shrubs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| We recently approved an easement for a right-of-way on Sutherland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| for a fence, I think, and on Gay Street for an awning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| but these types of mistakes are usually remodels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| We don't usually see this type of mistake on a new construction development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| I don't intend to support this, mostly from an equity standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| I realize the cost of reconstructing this, but it is possible, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| but I also realize the importance of equitable enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| We must treat small projects like residential backyard decks and sheds the same as large construction apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| and so there's been a lot of small projects I'm aware of that someone either had to rebuild or move as a result of something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1715)|
| 0:28:44| I do think the developer can reconstruct it, and I think it's a substantial miss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| so it's not as if the buildings have to come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| but I do think these elements, as I understand it, are stairs and entryways, particularly pavement for ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1733)|
| 0:29:02| As a result of that, I don't think that this is a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| I don't think the public misses out on something by reconstructing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| and I do think that they miss out on the property space that was supposed to be city right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| If it was smaller or negligible, I wouldn't be against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| but I won't be able to support this encroachment because I think the tradeoff for accountability is missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| as well as I think there are much smaller properties and presidential owners who have to move things or reconstruct things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| and I don't think this is a deal-breaker for the apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| So I won't be able to support this, but I'll pause now and let any of my other colleagues have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1780)|
| 0:29:50| Any council member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Mr. Clabo, there weren't a lot of visuals in our packet to help understand exactly what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1794)|
| 0:30:03| There's three different spots that are requiring some footage because they're encroaching on the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| And is it all footers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Is it all steps coming out of the structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| And is it three different buildings, or is it one building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| From my understanding, it's one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| It involves an accessible ramp into the building, some stairs and cheek walls of the stairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| but it also is a portion of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| You might be able to speak to this better than me, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Some of the footing of the building, but also a little bit of the building itself is within the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| So the actual building is in the right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| I don't believe that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| I don't believe that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I think it's just underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| It's the footers underneath and a step connecting to the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| So, Mr. Clabo, when this was discovered, was there a conversation from engineering about you need to turn it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| you need to tear the accessible ramp out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| What were the conversations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| We had adjacent public improvements with the waterfront drive, so we were placing a curb and a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1878)|
| 0:31:27| So when we were out there surveying for that, we realized that these areas were encroaching in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| So at that point, we let Dominion know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Oh, so you let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| It's not they let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| I didn't quite understand that from what Mr. Chalmers said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| I thought it was some of the follow-up work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| In your career with the city, how long have you been with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| And I know a lot of it's been with traffic, but is this pretty unusual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| It is for new construction, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| I don't know what to say because it's just an interesting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| So what we're voting on is easements to allow these encroachments to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| There's no money involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| They're not paying the city for the easements they get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Let me throw this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| KUB approached me for an easement to be able to anchor a pole, and they offered me money for it, for that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1950)|
| 0:32:42| So how come there's no money involved in the easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Just historically, when we've encountered these issues, there's not been any funds involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1965)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| I'll see if any of my colleagues have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| Mr. Chalmers, have you looked at how to rebuild and tear out to not need the easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| It would be very difficult to rebuild this because it deals with the structure of the building underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| I don't have an answer right now of how we would cut that and rectify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| I guess my question is, let me just cut you off and say, I'm not asking you how much because I'm going to guess it's a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| but I'm just like, what's the actual ability, feasibility of moving a corner of a building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2003)|
| 0:33:34| I would say it's very infeasible at this point to do it and have the building be structurally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2014)|
| 0:33:43| Mr. Clabo, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Maybe this is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| This resolution authorizes me to execute an easement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| That easement agreement, if this is approved, is yet to be drafted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Could it contain monetary value to pay for the city for an easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2040)|
| 0:34:07| I know we're paying for rights-of-way and easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| I just want to help counsel to understand what we normally do in those types of situations versus what's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2053)|
| 0:34:24| I know of nothing in the law that would prohibit some rental fee or charge associated with the obtaining of an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2064)|
| 0:34:35| We have not historically done that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| I'm still thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| I wasn't expecting it really to be controversial, but now I see that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| I guess one thing that concerns me is us setting some kind of a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| I mean, it's regrettable that the builder made a mistake here, and we always like to try to help out some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2098)|
| 0:35:09| but for the city not to be compensated in any way for providing something that is of benefit to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2109)|
| 0:35:23| I guess I'm a little reluctant just to let the developer make a mistake and then not have any benefit accrued to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| It just kind of sets a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| If you mess up, we will just kind of let you go without any kind of repercussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2134)|
| 0:35:43| So I guess I'm trying to struggle in whether or not we should not allow the easement or allow the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| but require some kind of monetary benefit to the city for giving it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| I think that's kind of what I'm thinking of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| I'm trying to get a handle on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| So the building is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| The footer is underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| And the footer underground is encroaching on an easement that goes all the way to the bottom of the earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| The stairs and the other stuff, I would assume they might be able to be more easily remedied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2183)|
| 0:36:34| than the corner of a footer in a building that's already built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Theoretically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Theoretically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| One thing is above ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| A couple of things are above ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| The other is not and would render some structural impediments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| So one question for my colleagues is can you divide the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2213)|
| 0:37:02| You know, I mean, I understand the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| I also understand the money thing, but you didn't do this on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2228)|
| 0:37:16| There was a survey mistake that then led to other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| So it doesn't look to me like you were trying to take advantage of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| and build where you knew you could not build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| That to me is different than somebody who intentionally encroached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| So I'm struggling with this because I have great empathy for the situation you find yourself in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| and I don't know how you make somebody dig up the footer for a building that's already built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| But I also know stairs and stuff can be rebuilt, and that is expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| but not as expensive as a corner of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| So that's kind of my thought about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Is there a way that, you know, and maybe we can't decide this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| I don't know because I don't know what you're agreeable to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| but negotiating on the fly in a public meeting is not usually the way it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| But, you know, my first thought, because I always look for compromises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| is there a way to grant an easement for what cannot be changed and discuss more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| Can there be something done to remedy the other issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| I mean, from a principal standpoint, this is new for us too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| and I think one of the factors that led to this is the sidewalk and the edge of the road was not in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| and so that was part of the mistake was, in a typical scenario, those elements would be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| so it would give them some sort of a gauge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Obviously, it should have been done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| I will say to Councilwoman Ryder's proposal about the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| that is pretty common in our world as well, where if there's a use for somebody's land for an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| it's not uncommon for there to be some compensation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| That had not been discussed or asked of us, but we would be open as far as making it a simple thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| and I think, you know, from the city's standpoint, it makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| if the city's going to give some land to a property owner that there be some compensation for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| that there's an industry standard behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Our question would be, who would we discuss that with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| Councilmembers, just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| As these new questions come to light, this could be an item that you decide to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| That's exactly where I was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| We have some good questions here that might be easier to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| and then bring back to you with a solution that reflects that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| I'm going to make a motion that we postpone this for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| If you come back sooner, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| but I think four weeks to allow some time to negotiate and see what something can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2400)|
| 0:40:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Motion made to postpone this item by four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| A lot of people's lights are still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Do you want to talk about this motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| I don't know who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Councilmember Parker, and then we'll go to this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| Go ahead, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| I can speak to the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| I'm not necessarily opposed to postponing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| but I am in agreement with Vice Mayor Smith that we have had to make some really tough decisions that have come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2444)|
| 0:40:55| I've been very frustrated and argued and pushed back on us having to make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| when someone appeals a BZA decision and needs a variance to maintain some building on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2463)|
| 0:41:18| It didn't meet the requirements for us to grant that appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| and so they've had to tear buildings down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| I imagine that type of expense to an individual is comparable to the level of expense that you're potentially facing with this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2487)|
| 0:41:38| We have some tough decisions that come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| and I do believe that we have to hold the same standard for residents in our community as we do commercial activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2502)|
| 0:41:51| even though that price tag might be shocking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| That price tag for that individual resident is also shocking when they have to deal with items on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| I'm not opposed to postponing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| but I'm not sure if there is a negotiated deal here without the public and that neighborhood losing in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2528)|
| 0:42:23| I'm very, very hesitant for this to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| and the neighborhood has expressed that they're opposed to Dominion even being able to purchase this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2548)|
| 0:42:39| So that should be considered as conversations move forward, what the neighborhood hopes to get out of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| I'm also in agreement with a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| I think the circumstances would be different if it were all on the developer as it relates to the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2581)|
| 0:43:10| and that there was a mistake or misjudgment in the survey that brought you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| Is that correct today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Because of that fact, I do feel like I'd like to see some of the questions answered that have been brought up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2599)|
| 0:43:29| as well as to see if there could be something that could be brought back to council as it relates to a negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| potentially a monetary, because according to what's in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| you're asking for a lease of this encroachment for, what, 15, 20 years, or did I read that incorrectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2622)|
| 0:43:51| Is there something there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Oh, forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| I was reading something different then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| A little longer than 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Yeah, a lot longer than 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| So I would like to see what comes back for our consideration as it relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2641)|
| 0:44:10| I don't disagree with Councilwoman Parker either that this was controversial when it first came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| as it relates to this property and the purchase of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| but I would like to have our colleagues maybe consider whatever negotiations could be brought back to us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2662)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| With regard to the postponement, if the item is postponed, I would request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| and I think Council Member Ryder mentioned this, there's really not a lot of detail in this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2686)|
| 0:44:56| and there's no pictures, so it's a lot harder for us to, without driving down and checking out the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| it'll be a lot harder for us to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| I'm not opposed to doing that, but it would be nice if this is postponed to have a little bit more detail in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| especially some pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| My understanding from what you've described today is that one of the most difficult pieces of this for you to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2716)|
| 0:45:28| would be the footer, and that's underground and is not seen by somebody passing by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| And then there's two other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| One's a staircase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| I believe it's a portion of a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| A portion of a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| And then after that, what's the rest of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| I believe that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| I'm sorry if you didn't get all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| We were under the impression that that information had been gathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| Well, it's not that there's not information in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| There's no pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| There's one picture in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| I'm not so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| There's supposed to be some profiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| I'm sorry, that's missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| So there's a portion of a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| The only thing that a walker by would notice is a portion of a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| It just extends into the sidewalk area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| So honestly, a walker by wouldn't even perceive that there's anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| And then my final question is just, obviously there's a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| and you're telling us that the survey had an error in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| Is there not insurance that deals with those mistakes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| Is somebody not insured to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| and if they made an error that there's insurance to address any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| with repairs or addressing this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| We would go down that path with our builder and consultants to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| That would be a more painful path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| So there is insurance to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| You haven't gone through that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Yes, all the people we work with are insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Mr. Clabo, if I could just ask a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| If this is postponed, does that delay in any way our infrastructure improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| Does this encroachment impede our ability to build the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| that we're already moving forward on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| No, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| And so postponing this item won't slow that project down at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Council Member Helsley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| I would like to have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| If we postpone, what are we asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| I mean, what do we hope to accomplish with a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| I mean, I think it comes to an equity issue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| There are people in that area that have had to remove structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| And these are just homeowners who don't have a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| And I can't verify this, but I was also told somebody was made to move a chicken coop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| that was on their own property in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| So it just seems like there's different rules for different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| So it would be nice to kind of know where we were going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| I think that question was directed at me since I'm the one asking for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| That's not a criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| I'm just saying I'm the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| I asked for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| So what I'm hoping to accomplish is is there something that can work rather than all or nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2916)|
| 0:48:49| Because I do understand the issue of equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| but I also understand if one of the things you're gauging off of to do the survey isn't there, you can make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2936)|
| 0:49:06| And here we are, process is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| And as Mr. Roberto said, there's insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| But I, too, would like to see pictures and actually really understand what this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| and if there's an offer of compensation that then we can build more green someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| I mean, I just think these are questions that I would like to think we may have vetted before we decide all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2970)|
| 0:49:42| That's what I'm hoping to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| You can still vote against it, but I would like some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Council Member Reiter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Mr. Chalmers, would reconstruction limit the ability to occupy the units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| That's part one of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| Part two of a question, are these rented or owned properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| They're rented and they're currently occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| So we've got a rental unit with a tenant in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| You'd have to tear out a footer, redesign their stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| And I do have an architectural drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| I'm sorry, when I pick this up, it moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| It's just a little hard for maybe the layperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| I mean, maybe I'm not your average bear, but I still can't tell exactly what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| I can tell that there's three easement sites in this drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| and I can't tell exactly how far apart they are from each other, but they look pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| And some of them are pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| So one's a ramp, and one's a footer, and one's some steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| No corner of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| So when you tear out the footer, the footer is for the steps, not for the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Some of the footers are for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Some of the footer's for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Shooting a miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Anyway, you know, okay, so could someone still stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| You've got a tenant in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Would they have to vacate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| I don't know the answer to that right at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Okay, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| That would be a question that I'd like answered in the next four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| And the other thing I'd say is, you know, there are appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| Mr. Clabo and Mr. Swanson and Mr. Frost, it's my understanding that right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| and other such things are given appraisals, and those things can be appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| My guess is that's not going to happen in a four-week time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| So to the point of the postponement, what can happen in a four-week turnaround time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3112)|
| 0:52:01| I mean, we could start looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I can't guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Well, we could start with a four-week postponement, can't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| And I think it, you know, I'm sure it's unfair to some people that have had to move things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| like a chicken coop or a garage in the instance of a fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| We've had that happen where someone built a garage on KVUB's land, but no one was living in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3140)|
| 0:52:28| Those were not occupied, so I just think that's a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| I just think we have a lot of factors here that aren't known at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| and I'd like more information before we vote yay or nay, because we have constituents that are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| don't vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Don't give you free land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| You put your footer in the city's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| You built it on your neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| And if I built on my neighbor's property, I'd probably have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| And I've got one in my district right now, and they, I think, built pretty darn close to the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| and so willfully without permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| So we'll see what's going to happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| So we might have more fun with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| I see where my colleagues are saying equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| So I'll be supporting the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Why I second it is because I think we need a better solution than you get an easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| into the public right away with your steps, your whatever, your whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| And the last question, is there some landscaping that didn't happen because of this, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3200)|
| 0:53:28| So as part of the public improvements, we constructed a curb, a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| and there was intended to be a five-foot landscaped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| So in order to accommodate these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| A buffer strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| And we ended up moving the sidewalk closer to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| and reduced that strip to two feet instead of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| Mr. Clabo, did we have to spend some money and time on design to move the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| I mean, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Negligible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Yeah, for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| I'll turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Council, I'll just say that I think, given what Mr. Clabo said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| like some big engineering changes or proposals from a construction angle are not possible in four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| but I can ask our law director to help us evaluate what other options are available to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3253)|
| 0:54:21| that would make the most sense for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| So that's something we can definitely do in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| Can I make a simple proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Well, I mean, you can, but I mean, we sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| It was brought up about our purchase of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| If we did a, you know, what we paid per acre for the amount of land that we're acquiring here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| and start that as a proposal to, you know, it was brought up about how long a true appraisal would take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| but we could start with what we paid for the land on a per acre basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| apply that to the amount of land here and submit that for the city's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Yes, that's the kind of thing that our law department can help evaluate once you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| if this postponement is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| Example of the chicken coop, and in my district it's been a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| And a few years ago there was a neighbor who relied on the advice of the builder of the swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| about where it could be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| After it was completely done, the city was alerted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| and he actually had to move the swimming pool to fit the proper location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| I don't know what his repercussions or what kind of ability he was to regain from the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3339)|
| 0:55:48| who gave him that bad advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| You're in a bit of a similar situation and I don't for a minute think you did it on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| Accidents happen just like the chicken coop and the swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| But I guess what I'm getting at is this is a lot more complicated than I think most of us imagined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| and I think we do need this postponement just to sort all this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| and see if we can find the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| So I'll, of course, be voting for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| I just got pictures of the situation a few hours ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| so allow me to try to paint a picture briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| I actually think the best thing to do would be to reset and to withdraw this, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| because a postponement doesn't change the structure of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| It just kicks it down the road for four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| and while it does give some time for negotiations or ideation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| there's no reason to push this forward if it's going to change structurally, which I think it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| There is one building and there are three parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| One is the corner of a building, which I agree is very substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| And by the way, how many buildings have you all built in the past couple of years in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| A good number of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| Give me a ballpark, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Work with me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thirty buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Thirty buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| So have you ever had this happen in those 30 buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| We have not had another situation like this, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| I'm trying to compliment you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| This is not intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| This is not nefarious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| It's just, as you mentioned, the surveyor got it wrong a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| And so I'm not necessarily worried about the precedent we set for Dominion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| because I think you've got a good record of following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| I'm more worried, as Councilmember Thomas mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| about setting the precedent for other developments where, sorry, it's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| We can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| I do agree that the corner of the building is substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| and does require probably a little bit more thought about potentially purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| that corner amount of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| The other two areas in a picture are like a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| So it can be reconstructed pretty easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| The appraiser does have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| This is not a game-changer amount of money to change the step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| The third piece is the entranceway, a door, not necessarily to a specific apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| but to the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| It's an ADA ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| There's a portion of it, I'm going to go with a half or a third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| based on the picture that I saw, that is too wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| and would need to be reconstructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| That, too, seems feasible and not a game-changer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| and don't have to kick anybody out or tear the building down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| So there are three distinct things, which is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| why I think that withdrawing this actually allows everybody to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| I do think that a good middle ground would be to ask the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| to repair those two smaller negligible things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| It allows the city to reclaim its proper rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| For the more substantial one, I think the withdrawal gives you time to work with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| to determine a cost to keep that building without tearing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| I think there are eight buildings, is that right, on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| So we just missed a few parts of one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| I think that's the right approach for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| and I don't think necessarily a postponement is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| but it doesn't change the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| and given the breakdown of the three pieces that I just outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| if you have the pictures, which, again, withdrawing this and starting over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| allows everybody to see the same thing that I saw today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| and I think allows you to break this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| I don't think there's any reason why these three items need to be joined at the hip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| and I don't think it's, given the size of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| and the collaboration with the city thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| I don't think it's too substantial to ask for those two somewhat minor reconstruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| and allow for negotiation on the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| So that's the only reason I don't think the postponement does much to solve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| because we're going to be back with the same words in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| Okay, the motion on the floor is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| I understand where you're going, Vice Mayor Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| but the point of the postponement was we've just done what I didn't want us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| which is try to negotiate and offer solutions on the fly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| and we don't know if they're okay with withdrawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| and that's why I just did a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Somebody can rewrite what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| They can withdraw it and submit something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| but at least this keeps us on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| I will not be heartbroken if you vote down my postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| I will still speak to you, but, you know, then we're going to have to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3641)|
| 1:00:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Everybody understand the motion we're voting on is to postpone for four weeks this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| Any questions or discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Seeing none, all those in favor of oh, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| If we postpone this item, would the applicant have the ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3666)|
| 1:01:14| if this whole thing needs to be rewritten, would that be admissible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| or would the withdrawal of this item allow the latitude to be able to submit something totally different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3681)|
| 1:01:32| I just don't know how much latitude they'll have with a postponement versus a withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| I think a postponement allows us to explore the entire situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| determine what seems to make sense with regard to these situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| and come back to you with our best proposed advice with regard to what that would be, how it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Seeing no other lights on, all those in favor of this postponement, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3722)|

| 1:03:02| Council members, I just wanted to say that the curb cuts program that we fund and you all approve every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| is a big part of helping to make Knoxville a welcoming and accessible city for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| This summer, someone asked me, you know, Mayor, why do you spend, why does the city spend so much money on curb cuts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| I never see anybody on wheelchairs, you know, on those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| And it's like because, you know, the answer was because the curb cuts aren't there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| And like at one point in most everybody's life, there's going to be mobility impairments due to age or health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| or a temporary injury or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| So I'm really pleased that the city continues to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| And this is just one more year and effort to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| And we try to do it during the same time we're repaving so it minimizes the disruption to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| Yes, Mayor, I would just echo that and quickly as someone who bicycles a lot and has for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| I can't minimize the importance of curb cuts as far as safety goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=3846)|

| 1:10:15| Yeah, I'd just like to ask the Chief, are there partnerships that we do with them in regards to violent crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4215)|
| 1:10:26| This is part of those grants that we've been approving with the different agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4226)|

| 1:10:43| And this is one of the, I think maybe the fifth time that we've passed $25,000 to different agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4243)|

| 1:12:27| Council members, we have one person signed up for public forum, Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| If you come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| and you will have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| Hi, my name is Tom Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| I live in Knoxville District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| I hate to bring old business before the council at the first meeting of the new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| but my apologies, I couldn't be here for the past couple meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| So I have a couple comments to make on some of the conduct of this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| that happened on November the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| And this was, of course, the day where Ms. Parker put forth her resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| It was also a day that was very shameful for this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| because there were a number of people whose voices were silenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| That day there were 30 individuals who were signed up to speak at the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| And as you all know, due to the council's somewhat idiotic rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| only six people are able to speak unless you all choose to amend the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| which in my experience is done almost every single time there are more than six people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| signed up to speak at the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| And so I just wanted to bring up to this council again how it is a disservice to the citizens of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| for you not to allow them to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| In this case it was about 25 people who were not allowed to speak their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| on what obviously was a very contentious issue because the floor here was filled to the brim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4444)|
| 1:14:11| And so, you know, I myself being one of those people who are not allowed to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| but I'm more concerned about the copious members of the Palestinian and Muslim community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| who were here that day and who had wished to speak on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| And so I feel like me personally, as well as them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| probably all felt that you all did not wish to hear our voices on that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| and I find that to be an unacceptable conduct of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| And so I hope in 2024 we can refrain from not allowing people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| You know, this is something that happens once every two weeks where the constituents of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| are able to come and pour their hearts out to you and give you their ideas and their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| And so I just hope that we can be allowed to speak moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| And so I guess I'll leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| I had a lot of other things to say about how I felt this council disregarded Ms. Parker's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4513)|
| 1:15:23| and what that has to say about the moral conscience of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| but we'll save that for another day. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| Thank you, council members. That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| And without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240109?start=4536)|
