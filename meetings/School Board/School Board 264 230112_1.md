| 2:11:27| Oh, that was from before. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| Okay. So we are going to vote on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7889)|
| 2:11:38| original, the only, so the only issue is when you talk about the section, I guess, on transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7898)|
| 2:11:52| I mean, if we make that amendment and then that doesn't, right, then we, it's deleted, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7912)|
| 2:12:09| Yeah, that's, I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| That's true. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| Okay. All right. So we will vote on the document itself first. Is this correct, Mr. Duport? Are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7933)|
| 2:12:25| The board, the will of the board here, you know, but I'm just trying to make sure we're on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7945)|
| 2:12:30| right track. Is the board then okay with the, with the other corrections that Ms. Horn suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7950)|
| 2:12:39| and you're just voting on the four additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| With our suggestions, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7965)|
| 2:12:57| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| Just making sure we're, so we're voting on the, so that, so that when somebody looks at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| you know, on down the road. Right. So we're voting on the document with a change to the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| that the change to TESA funding and deleting the first sentence, and adding a last section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7990)|
| 2:13:20| which may or may not have, right, deleting transparency, and then adding that last section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8006)|
| 2:13:37| I think we're good. We're also, we're correcting the 2022 in the first sentence of the talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| Are we adding foundational to literacy instruction or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8022)|
| 2:13:50| Well, if it's in, it's in here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| I think it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| I mean, we would vote on that amendment separately. Are you saying, okay, here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| If we updated that to what you said with the foundational literacy and skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8041)|
| 2:14:07| and then we'll be voting on this, it would be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| for something that the state has already done, and we support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| This one is, this one is to continue, this one has two, two pieces to it. Part of it is the academic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8057)|
| 2:14:28| and retention decisions, and local control. So the full, the full paragraph says districts must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8068)|
| 2:14:36| continue to have flexibility to adopt instructional and supplemental materials in partnership with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| teachers and with families, including appropriate evidence-based teacher training and materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| for reading and foundational literacy instruction and skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| So do you want to keep that foundational and skills in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| Yeah, yeah, and then vote on this, just because I think those two things work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| the retention and the foundational literacy and comprehension. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8099)|
| 2:15:05| Okay, changing the funding for public education just to the heading of TISA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8105)|
| 2:15:12| should it say TISA and funding, since TISA is a formula, and so just TISA and funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8112)|
| 2:15:20| TISA slash funding, and take out the first sentence there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8120)|
| 2:15:26| and delete the transparency section, and there were no other deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8126)|
| 2:15:37| Correct, yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8137)|

| 2:16:12| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| So, point of order, Mr. Dupler, would it be best, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| for someone to make a motion to add an amendment piece by piece, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8180)|
| 2:16:26| Oh, that's already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Okay, so going on, so we're just going to go down the row, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| So, Ms. Coatney, we are now on amendment one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| Hey, Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| You want me to read the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| Yeah, exactly, you may want to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| Or do you have them, do you have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| I don't care, I can mark this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| Since these are, shall we call them amendments, or shall we just call them by their title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| I would say in the document by their title, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| Right, so should we vote on them that way, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| Yeah, we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| So, the first thing we will be voting on is adding parental transparency, which the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8220)|
| 2:17:09| is parents are best equipped and informed to know their children and make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| regarding their needs and challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| The Knox County Board of Education supports the efforts of the state legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| to clarify the rights and empower parents in their child's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8239)|

| 2:17:52| The next topic would be literacy instruction and the language is the Knox County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8272)|

| 2:19:08| The next section, we do not have a heading for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| It just says Amendment 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8354)|
| 2:19:21| Whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8361)|

| 2:19:34| ensuring that young women in Knox County have the opportunity to compete and succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8374)|

| 2:21:19| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| So moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Madam Chair, we have one public speaker signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| Mandy Hargis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| My name is Mandy Hargis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| I am the mother of a seventh grade student at Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| At the end of last school year, I became aware of the requirements for students to make honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| roll and based on my own child's experience and what I was hearing from other parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| at this school, I began advocating to have this policy changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| I initially reached out to Principal Corey Smith in May of 2022 regarding this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| and was denied the opportunity to address the group of staff at the school who make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| decisions concerning such policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| I was later informed that this group declined to make any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| At that time in August of 2022, it was suggested that I reach out to my local representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| for further advice and assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| In an effort to save time, I will say that at some point in my journey to advocate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| change, I have reached out to the following individuals for assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| Florence Nadee, Region 2 Supervisor Nate Laganos, District 6 Board Member Betsy Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| Superintendent John Ryswick, and then subsequently each and every board member in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| None of these interactions have been positive or resulted in any action to help create change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| for students at Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| Furthermore, I have been told that Principal Smith has autonomy and that no one is willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| to review or overrule his policy and advocate for the students at this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8568)|
| 2:22:52| Despite bringing to the attention of each and every one of you that Knox County School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8572)|
| 2:22:56| District's policy I-310, titled Reporting Student Progress, is woefully inadequate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| that the county locks a policy regarding honor roll at both at all, both of which directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8581)|
| 2:23:06| affect the Hardin Valley policy, no positive change has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| Indeed, the proposed changes to I-310, which were voted on last month, merely condone and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| promote the unfair policy of Hardin Valley Middle School and completely ignore the deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8595)|
| 2:23:20| in which I have previously brought to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| Finally, I want to say that I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed not only with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| the fact that I have to contact so many people and jump through so many hoops to advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| for my child and all of the students at Hardin Valley Middle School, but also in the quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| of the interactions I have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| I have been passed from one person to another and not a single one of you has been willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| to do anything about the policies I brought to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| Additionally, the issues that other parents and I have with the honor roll policy should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| have been able to be addressed in a positive, mutually agreeable outcome at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| The fact that I have been forced to address you all tonight only shows me that this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| is more interested in the politics and not in the best interest of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| You should all be very ashamed of yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=8652)|
