| 0:01:29| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| I don't know if we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Apparently Mr. Pavlis knows he's going to be late, and I think we're expecting the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| We'll see how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| A couple, before we turn it over to Ms. Rojero, one quick agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=98)|
| 0:01:48| Public forum is not part of workshop agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| I will go ahead and add that if there is no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| Alright, so public forum is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| Let me say for the audience, we want everybody to sign in, and there's a sign in sheet on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| the back table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| If you're interested in speaking at public forum, you can sign up back there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| We're also pretty flexible at these, so folks probably can stand up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| Are there any announcements from council that anybody wants to make before we get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| Mr. Becker, I will not be attending the workshop we're having next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=144)|
| 0:02:35| I was going to suggest that Mr. Grieve chair that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| We're having a workshop on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| He's our liaison with the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| That seemed a logical way to move, but I think that's actually a decision you all can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| at the meeting itself, but I wanted to leave it in the best shape I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| Any other reports from people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| If not, we will, I guess, turn this over to Ms. Rojero for a presentation on the consolidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| five-year plan, and this will be on our next council agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=185)|

| 0:03:15| that we're doing in community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=195)|

| 0:03:23| which you'll be voting on in a couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=203)|

| 0:03:32| some extra packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Our staff will hand those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Really, our purpose today is to provide an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| To provide an overview of our department goals, programs, and funding sources, we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| to highlight some of the events of the past year, and then we'll get into the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| of reviewing the consolidated plan and the annual action plan, and we'll take questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| along the way, but we want to make sure we have time for those before we leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| I'd like to start by introducing my staff that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=246)|

| 0:04:15| Becky Wade is our community development administrator, and she was basically the person mostly in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| charge of this, so if you've read this plan already, you'll realize what a tough job that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| is, so I want to recognize Becky and all the staff that supported her, but it was primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| Becky's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=272)|

| 0:04:57| Everybody knows Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Stephanie, head of our, she's the ADA compliance director for the city, and she's the head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| of the disability office, disability services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Okay, the mission of the community development department is basically to revitalize low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| and moderate income communities and to strengthen all city neighborhoods, and we do this by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| working with multiple partners, non-profit, government, private sector partners, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=322)|
| 0:05:31| use various sources of funding and programs to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| When all is said and done, we have some desirable outcomes in all the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| Basically, we want to see safe, sustainable, and vibrant neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| We want decent, affordable, healthy, and energy efficient housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| We want accessible housing, and we want fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| We want to see economic opportunities for individuals and businesses, and we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| see active public participation through strong neighborhood organizations, and we do all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| of our work and think that the community is better if we do this through very responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| and collaborative partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| So our office is organized into basically six main areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| We have the office of disability services, as I mentioned, that Stephanie is in charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| of, the office of neighborhoods, the fair housing office, in which we do investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| fair housing complaints in addition to providing education on fair housing rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=387)|
| 0:06:36| That is Tara Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| The housing section manages all of the different housing programs that we'll be talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| and Tim Demick is in charge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| The economic development section, which does a lot of our blighted property acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| chronic problem properties, homemakers, the commercial facades, the business expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| loan programs, that's headed by Roger Stoudy, and the grants administration section is Becky's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=418)|
| 0:07:06| We have something like 25 staff members, a few are part-time, most are full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=426)|
| 0:07:15| Now if you look at the next page, we have this big long page here, 11 by 17 page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| This is really to give you an overview of the different programs and projects and funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| sources and I'm just going to kind of go through this, stop me, but I'm not going to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| each one individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| You have seen a lot of these because many of these projects you either approve at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| plan stage and or you approve them when contracts have to be signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=458)|
| 0:07:46| So at the very top, we do get about a million dollars a year more or less in city general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| operating that includes $323,000 for the affordable housing trust fund and includes our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| of neighborhoods and the neighborhood small grants, which is typically about $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Of course, we haven't seen this year's budget yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| We also get city capital projects, which are listed there, ADA access, blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| sidewalk repairs, facade improvements, and for three years in a row, we had dollars from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| the city for the park city and fill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| So it averages about a million a year and this is basically the budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| These are not balances that I'm showing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| These are the budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Until we get down to the empowerment zone, those are more of the balances and the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| So those are the city funds that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| We then have a number of grants, mostly federal, sometimes state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| Projects from row number 9 down through 32 were projects that you approved this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| last year, a variety of CDBG, HOME, and ESG and for the new folks, if you don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| what some of these acronyms are, please, the meeting will be twice as long if I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| say them all out, but I will be glad to tell you what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| So stop me if you need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=555)|

| 0:09:29| You might remember many people were displaced because of major code violations and we brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| this contract to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| That was something that came as sort of an emergency that was not part of the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| plan but fit in with the goals of the plan so we were able to do that and you all approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=580)|

| 0:11:40| I know right now we are up against a deadline with the empowerment zone money and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| to, it's all reimbursed money and we have to get it spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| What do those deadlines mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Is that when you have to spend it by or when you have to get reimbursed by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| That's the deadline for spending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| The grant is over on those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So if you spend it on the last day you can still turn it in and get reimbursed after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=723)|

| 0:12:11| With the empowerment zone, June 30th is when you are supposed to spend it, but we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| have another month to six weeks to draw it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| I will have to check on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| You can safely spend it by that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| I think that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| I can just say we've structured our contracts with the sub-recipients so that they end prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| to the deadline to make sure that they have time to get invoices in and we have time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| draw the money down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| And I actually have those contract deadlines next to the name of the project, you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| So they really, some of them were going to spend their money quicker and so it's a shorter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| contract and most of these were before you, I think just about all of them that are sub-recipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| you all had to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| So when you get into NSPTHDA, that's the Eastport project that we're putting $869,000 into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| It's also the purchase of foreclosed homes in Mechanicsville, Hope 6 area, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| some infrastructure and demolition, quite a bit for demolition actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| But then when you get down to rows 52 through 61, these are some prior projects that still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| have funds in them, that we still have ongoing projects or for one reason or another that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| project wasn't completed and we still have access to those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| And as you will recall, each year, really in about a month, HUD, there's a point in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| time where HUD looks and there's a formula where you cannot have more than one and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| half times your annual allocation sitting there up at the feds waiting to be drawn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| You have to have an under 1.5 ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| And so we always plan for that and make sure that we come in under that and that just shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| you that HUD realizes that you can't spend all this money in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| You make a plan, you have a plan and you implement that, you execute that plan, but inevitably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| there are delays because of the economy, the weather, the sub-recipients, there are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=856)|
| 0:14:25| reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Sometimes it's as simple as the contract language gets debated for months because we institute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| something new like insurance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| That's happened to us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| There are some tighter insurance requirements and we've had some projects delayed, but actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| a few of them haven't been executed yet, I think, maybe at least one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| So there are different reasons why projects are delayed, but HUD recognizes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| So we try to implement, we want them done because certainly there's need in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| but there are things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| And this year, because we've had such a push on Empowerment Zone, we've had to step back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| on some of the other projects in order to ensure that we met the Empowerment Zone deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| So once we get past that, we can turn our attention back to some of the owner-occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| rehabs that are funded out of home or CDBG and other kinds of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Is that still an ongoing project with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| Is it not completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| You mean, is HOPE VI ongoing or is the purchase of foreclosed homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Well, I'm just looking at the dates here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| You have 3-19-13 and so forth for HOPE VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| That includes more than just the mechanics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| This is a contract, you know, they've completed the HOPE VI project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| Really what this means is that there are homes in Mechanicsville Commons area that are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| foreclosed upon due to people not being able to pay their mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| And so their proposal in this plan was to have some money to buy those foreclosed homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| put some money into repairing them, and then get them back on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| That's what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| And they have until March of 2013 to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| And was the intent there to keep those homes from going into a landlord situation to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| to keep owner-occupied or just to try to keep more control of the housing stock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| That's part of it and, you know, plus when a home is vacant, then that's going to hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| everybody in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| So it's to keep the homes occupied and to try and keep home ownership, though they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| rent them if they have to, but the idea is home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| Yeah, a number of, all the people who bought homes in the HOPE VI area while the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| was going on were low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| They did have jobs and they did have mortgages, but just like everyone else in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| it was affected by the mortgage crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| So a number of those families went into foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| So when the ARRA money came along, we designated so much for that project so that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| purchase the homes and then resell them again to low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| Now, we're not sure that this full project will go forward, though, because there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| apparently some of those homes that were originally available were purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| And so whether, in fact, KCDC can implement this whole project as originally conceived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| you know, we're in conversation with them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| It is possible that we might come back with a revision to that contract, but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| So then you get down row 62 through 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| This is program income that comes in month after month after month, and it's based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| previous rehab loans that were made either through the House, which was a state program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| or HOPE III, which was a federal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| And so sometimes, like with 62 and 63 there, we'll actually take a chunk of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| income and allocate it to a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Row 64 is sort of a contingency fund, miscellaneous fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Sometimes we have projects in the housing section that just, there's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| needs to be done, but it just doesn't fit the CDBG or the House, or the home rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| and we can use house money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| And so it's a good fund for us to have when we kind of get in a bind, because every one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| of these programs has their own rules, their own regulations, their own reporting requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| and it's a big maze that you have to, you know, crawl through to figure out how to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1135)|

| 0:19:03| And then finally, rows 67 to 78, those are the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| What is the income on MnVILA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| That one, that is not income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| We're spending that income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| We allocated $100,000 of program income from House to the MnVILA project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| Yeah, so the money comes in, and this is how we spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| All right, okay, and so the Empowerment Zone projects, all of these are under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1169)|
| 0:19:41| and are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| We've talked about these before, I believe, where the, we're down to several, some big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| chunks of money related to construction, but they are working very diligently every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1196)|

| 0:20:00| I want to recognize Roger's daddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| He's just been unbelievable and jumping through hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| You all approved that one, those emergency amendments for Vestal the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| That's to keep these projects going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| You know, one issue has been the economy, that where we needed private sector investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| on a lot of these, it was very hard to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| There were a lot of delays, because it was hard to get financing, and there's just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| instability and kind of concerns, but we've got things moving, and it's our intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| to spend every penny of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| The other challenge in spending that is that we continue to get program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| The Blighted Properties Redevelopment Program, which is the second from the bottom, as people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| get a loan, they develop the property, and then they turn around and either get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| long-term financing, or they sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| All of a sudden, we've got $104,000 or $250,000 that we have to spend before we can draw any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| more down from the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| It's great that people are paying us back like they're supposed to, but it makes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| harder for us to then get every penny out of the treasury, which is what we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| to do, because it is allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| It's money that came from the citizens at some point and headed up to Washington, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| we're trying to get it back to make sure that we can reinvest it in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| The final four rows that I have in green, all of those projects will continue after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| the Empowerment Zone ends, because all of those are revolving loan funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| I don't have a projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| That's the next thing we need to do is sit down and figure that out, but the Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| Expansion Loan Program, the Small Business Loan Program that the Urban League implements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| for us, manages for us, the Blighted Property Redevelopment, and the Minor Home Repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| all of those are generating program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Those programs can continue at some level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| It won't be at the same levels before, because the income comes in over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| They're not fiscal year bound, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| They are not bound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| They kind of roll back in and you reinvest them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| We'll keep reinvesting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Just to keep us moving, because we've got a lot of stuff here to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| That's kind of the big picture of the different things that we're involved in, and those of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| you that went on the tour with us, you've got a sense of that, too, as you saw the variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| of projects all across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| We wanted to mention some of the highlights of this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| First of all, we got an excellent review from HUD when we submitted our CAPER, that's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| I think we did share that with you all when we got that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| We began implementation of the stimulus projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| Our office, the last year and a half, has just kind of been in a whirl between trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| to finish off with the Empowerment Zone and then get out plans that could be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| and implemented for the stimulus project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| A new $5.8 million came in over the last fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| As you saw on the previous page, we have either implemented ourselves or we have subrecipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| whom we must monitor for over 80 projects, which translates into literally hundreds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| individual activities, which we have to document every one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Every house that's rehabbed, every loan that's out there, you know, everything that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| These projects have all of these subprojects underneath them, and so there are hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| of individual activities, and so that's part of what we spend our day and night doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| We already talked about the Empowerment Zone, that it's coming to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| This year we also launched the Vacant Properties Campaign and had the Genesee Institute from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| Flint, Michigan come in and do an analysis of our current laws as they relate to tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| foreclosures and land banking authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| These are two of many tools in the community development toolbox that communities use in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| order to address vacant properties, and we are continuing that initiative, and by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| way, there's a group of UT students in the MBA program that are working with us right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| now to identify what happens to those properties that do sell a tax foreclosure, because our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1465)|
| 0:24:34| hypothesis, what we believe, what we know generally happens is that if you buy a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| in tax foreclosure, it's probably not going to get redeveloped anyway, because you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| get a clear title, and you can't get title insurance, and therefore you can't get a mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| But the way the laws are set up, there's sort of this trap that we fall into because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| of the way the laws are, so we're looking at how other communities have changed their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| statewide legislation, and we're also looking at things we can do locally, working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| with the county, trustee, our tax office, and Chancery Court to try and improve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| process to hopefully improve our chances of getting clear title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| So we're approaching it a couple different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| That's a big, long story we probably don't have time to get into, but we've launched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| that whole initiative, and we'll continue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| We've continued our focus and commitment to visitable, healthy, sustainable, and energy-efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| That's really been one of our mantras in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Both Eastport and Flinnican will be LEED-certified buildings, which means not only will they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| be developed in an energy-efficient way, but they will go even further in terms of seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| sustainable development practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| We've talked about that in some of our other presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Yes, I believe there are, aren't they all visitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| There will be visitable features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| They're going to meet the Federal Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, Section 504 Accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| I think some units are more accessible than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| Some units will be completely accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| You can chair full-use cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| You can think of low-level, community-based, hotel units, which means that they're ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| for installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| But at large, you know, those units should be accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| But they're not accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| All of our replacement homes that we oversee the construction of are required to be ENERGY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| STAR certified, which is a third-party certification that it meets certain energy efficiency standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| Our CHOTOs, our non-profit housing partners, all of their new construction is ENERGY STAR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| and they're visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| I already mentioned the CDBGR energy retrofits that Knox Housing Partnership is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| Not only will they be retrofitting existing homes in the Park City neighborhood, but they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| going to be using young interns who will be learning basically green techs, they're calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| them, who will learn some of these skills in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| We expect to implement soon the Earthcraft certification, which is something that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| out of South Face in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| It's, again, a third-party certification and this is for renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| ENERGY STAR is more for new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Our staff is certified, our housing staff is certified as healthy home specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| which means that they are experts in how you design a home and construct it so that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| good indoor air quality, you address mold issues, water issues and such, radon and the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| of those things that make a home actually unhealthy inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| So we're really focusing on that and will continue to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| We work very closely with our Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| We actually expanded membership on there and have brought in some more likewise excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| members and their role is really expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| They're starting to take on some of the tough issues that will be or have been to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| and so we're happy for that role with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| When I mentioned all of the many, many activities, the sub-activities to these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| every rehab, every My Front Yard, every burp loan, we have to track all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| and for years it was done in a customized access database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| because the city's financial, the Oracle financial system did not have the capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| was not designed to be able to track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Diana Loubertini, who many of you know, she designed that basically over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| and so we have worked, it literally took a year with finance, information systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| and our team meeting basically weekly to customize the Oracle financial system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| to be able to track all of this data so that we didn't have to enter the same information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| two times and that, because really the only official books are the city books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| and not our access database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| That's been a significant achievement and we appreciate finance and information systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| Of course, the other big thing we did was develop this five-year consolidated plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| and that's what we're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Now...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Madeline, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| On the third-party reviews of the different projects, whether sustainability or your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| would you call it the gold star?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Lead gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Lead, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Have you done a comparison in terms of what those costs are in terms of added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| to the cost of development and what the payback is on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| I'm going to defer that question to Tim Demick, our housing manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Can you address that, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| Tim, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Maybe come up to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Yeah, and while you're coming up, we had a comment from the CTV folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| that they can't hear most of us, so I'm going to insist that everybody turn your mic on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| and lean forward and speak clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| It's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| It's something I think we need to do a more formal analysis of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| We're certainly cognizant of the cost of going green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| and that there is a break-even point in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| So I think we are doing it informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| Some numbers I'll throw out at you in terms of the ENERGY STAR certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| on our new homes, we estimate that cost is about $2,000 extra per home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| and we're seeing a 30% decrease in utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| So that's a pretty good payback period for the ENERGY STAR certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| On the LEED projects, that is a more expensive certification process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| but we've worked with the developers to identify sort of the best certification route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| at the lowest cost and we haven't gotten one of those done yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| so we don't have any data yet on the savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| but we're certainly aware of not wanting to put a burden on the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and to see a return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| The nice synergy on the rental projects that are going LEED at Eastport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| and Flinnegan is the owners pay the utility bills in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| so they're going to be able to recapture some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| A lot of times the developer doesn't actually pay the utility bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| and so it's not easy to get the incentive aligned as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| So it's a great question and a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| I think as we do more, we need to probably do a more formal take on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| but in general the costs so far have been minimal and the paybacks have been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| I know we're looking at that on several of the university projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| and the university had made the decision instead of actually going to LEED certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| the state of Tennessee developed their own sustainability guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| and I don't know if you folks are aware of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| A lot of the same items are on the state's list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| but it's not as detailed as what LEED is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| If you haven't seen those, it might be a good idea to take a look at those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| just for a comparison and then be able to really see what your payback is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| I think we're still very much in a learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| This is something that across the country, across the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| really looking at how do we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| There are a lot of other approaches and so what we want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| on the front end exploring these and frankly you've got to test some out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| You've got to be willing to test it out and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| That's what the state's doing also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| They're developing their own sustainability guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| To me, this is important regardless of whether the developer gets it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| because we've got low income families that are now going to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| be in a rental unit or another unit and actually be able to afford staying there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| and it's that ongoing cost that really is the killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| We've always said that a house is not affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Your rent may be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Your mortgage may be affordable, but if your electric or gas bill isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| then it's not an affordable house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| We've not really helped them by putting them in a house with a high utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| I'm going to turn this over right now to Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| She's going to start talking to you about the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| I do want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| If you struggle to read that, first of all, we want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| this is not our idea of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| This is a required plan, a required format that is tedious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| You have to kind of struggle through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Sometimes the same question seems like it's asked four or five different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| in different ways, but if you can struggle with that and get to the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| and see what it is that we're going to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| and what we're proposing, then I think you'll get excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| We're excited about it, but you just have to kind of delve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| through the report to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Like Madeline said, the consolidated plan is a HUD plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| This is required by Housing and Urban Development for cities to submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Every three years or five years, we choose to submit it every five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| so that we can receive our entitlement funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| We could actually have meetings like this more often if we chose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| We would not recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| We wouldn't recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| So this plan covers a time period from July 1st, 2010 of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| through June 30th of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| Additionally, we have to do an annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| which is included in your binder there, for just the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| That's July 1st, 2010 through June 30th, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| So we had to do the same thing we do every year plus a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| For the first time, we combined with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| to do a lot of our information gathering and consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| with service providers and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| So I think it worked out very well for us to have the county with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| We were able to get a lot more participation from agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| and individuals when we did all our data gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| They're required to do the exact same plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| The consolidated plan is a community needs study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| It's how you structure your priorities within the federal priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| which are decent housing, suitable living environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| and economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Those are the areas that our federal funds can be targeted towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| And within those, you come up with your local priorities based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| community needs, the data, and the input from citizens and service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2176)|
| 0:36:24| The plan addresses how we, City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| will implement the priorities that we've addressed in this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| over the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| And then in the annual plan portion is where you get into exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| what projects will be funded each year to meet those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| Our planning began with a series of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| They were meetings, like I said, we joined with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| and we invited agencies and community leaders that serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| low to moderate income individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| We held those meetings all one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| It was November 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| They were held all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| And we broke that down to four focus group areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| We had a housing and economic development group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| homeless service providers group, education and job service group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| and a health and special needs group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| We had 29 organizations participating and about 70 people came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| In addition to taking down all their comments, writing those up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| we provided them with surveys and got back their documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| on what they felt like their needs were in order to assist them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| in helping to serve their population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| We also had interdepartmental meetings with city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| and with agencies that work very closely with us, like KCDC, CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| some of the agencies that we work with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| We had 24 attend our interdepartmental meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| intergovernmental meeting, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| We also had a youth input meeting at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| David Massey went and met with a government class and got their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| and that's also included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Our first public meeting was held December 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| That was held, you know, widely advertised, open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| We passed out surveys at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| We also sent surveys out through the neighborhood's newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| through a variety of sources, and we got back approximately 80 surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| Our next public meeting is next Tuesday evening at 5.30 at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| Canceler Y and at that time we will take public comment on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| All those comments will be included in the final plan that you will approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| hopefully, on April the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| We will pass those out to you that night so you can see the public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| Okay, like I said, in addition to getting information from agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| and the public about what they see the needs are, we have to evaluate data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| based on what HUD provides us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| And this is data based on housing needs primarily of lower income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2382)|
| 0:39:49| As expected, the greatest need is for the very lowest income population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| 30% or below of area median income, that's $17,650 for a family of four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2395)|
| 0:40:03| shows a very high need for renters and homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Very low income, that first category, I'm sorry, is called extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| That's a HUD definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Very low is between 31% AMI and 50% AMI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| and that amount is $29,400 for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| Once again, we show very high needs in those areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| And for low income families, that's a family of four, $47,050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| There still are needs, primarily in the homeownership category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| And by housing need, what that means, it's spelled out in your binder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| but that's where somebody pays over 30% of their income for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| or they are in an overcrowded situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| or they lack indoor plumbing or full kitchen facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| So that is a HUD definition of housing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| And that information is provided to us via their housing website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2468)|
| 0:41:18| We also evaluated the housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| And interestingly, citywide, 67% of the housing was built before 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2482)|
| 0:41:31| Well, that's a trigger for us because that's when lead paint stopped being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| Houses built prior to that are very likely to have lead paint in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| If we do any kind of rehabilitation on a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| we do have to test it for lead paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| We have to make sure that there isn't any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| or we have to abate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| For a full rehab, it has to be abated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| So it's very likely that most housing rehabs we get into require lead abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2515)|
| 0:42:05| I'm going to talk about the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| I'm confused about that because I saw that section in the booklet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| and I was thinking, how many people are eating their walls or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| I mean, if you're not a contractor grinding it up and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| this stuff's buried under 10 layers of paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| What's the big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| But I realize there are regs that EPA puts out and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| but it's kind of like madness to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Well, Tim may want to comment about this some more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| but there are HUD federal requirements that if you spend over $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| on any kind of project on a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| you have to test it for lead if it is older than 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| Just briefly, it is a significant problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| particularly with younger children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| It's a neurotoxin, and the issue is the dust that's created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| And a lot of times with the older windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| any time you have paint chips or peeling paint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| once they become airborne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| you can actually find children that have lead poisoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| through screenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| The health department has some data on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| So I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| In certain circumstances, it does seem like overkill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| but a lot of our funding, there's some grant funding we have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| that's particularly tied to households with young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| That's really where it's worth doing the lead abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| It can be a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| Do you have to get contractors that are certified and spend extra money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I picture the asbestos days when they go in with the spacesuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| If you leave that stuff alone, it doesn't get airborne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| But that's part of the requirements that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| We have to use state-certified lead contractors on the lead work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| And that does increase the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| But if we're doing work on a house that has lead paint in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| we're going to want contractors who know how to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| because we can kill workers if we don't do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Workers can be poisoned too, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| When you're removing the paint, you're creating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| As many of you may know, for the past ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| we've had an empowerment zone designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| And the empowerment zone has served as basically our target area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| It's a neighborhood revitalization strategy area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| as far as HUD's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| And so we have focused our resources in the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| primarily, for the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Since that designation has gone away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| we are no longer required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| But in evaluating all the data that we had about housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| and income levels and needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| we found that there were some target areas within the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| that we wanted to focus our resources on in a strategic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| And there's a number of reasons why we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| And I'll go through the target areas first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| Can everybody see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| You may see it better in your handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Target area one is East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| The census tracts are actually on the next map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| but we'll get into that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Target area two is Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, and Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| Target area three is Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| And then across Broadway, I'm not sure exactly what it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| but it's Cecil, Chicago Avenue kind of area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| That's all one target area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| And then target area four is South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| includes the South Waterfront Development and Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| And I'm going to go through some reasons why we chose those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| as our target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| First of all, this is the income map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And if you can see that the darkest red area in the center there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| of the map shows that 80% of the households have incomes at less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2770)|
| 0:46:19| than or equal to 80% AMI, which is the population we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| required to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| So as you see right off the bat, that dark red area has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| the lowest income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| The next darker or lighter, I should say orange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| at 60, slightly over 60%, up to 80% of the households are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| or below 80% AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| The sort of mustard yellow is 40.1 to 60%, 80% or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2808)|
| 0:46:57| And then the bright yellow is 20 to 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| So our target areas are overlaid on that and they're crosshatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| And so you can see that within all of our target areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| we are serving low-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| What is the base rate that you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| We have to serve families at 80 or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| 80% AMI or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| And what is AMI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Area median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| You want the amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| And what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| It's $47,050 for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| So it changes based on your family size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| This is just zooming in a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| You can see the census tracts are on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| So you can see where the east one includes 5, 6, 19, 20, 21, and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2866)|
| 0:47:57| Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, Beaumont is 12, 13, 14, and 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Oakwood-Lincoln Park and that other area is 15, 17, and 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| And the south Knoxville target area is 8 and 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Census tract numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| Let me ask you a question about that family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| For one, for a single, you know, an elderly person or an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| what would that figure be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| I didn't bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| One person household at 80?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| I know a lot of elderly people who live alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Who would be in this target area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| That number for one household individual is $32,750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| That's 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Most of the families we serve are far below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| We are allowed to go up to 80%, but most of the families we serve are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| in the very low income bracket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2937)|
| 0:49:05| This next map shows the NSP2 target area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| You might remember that we applied for an NSP2 grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| That was the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| This area was derived from data provided on the number of high cost mortgages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| and potential vacant properties within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| So as you can see, this map, it's not 100%, but it overlays quite well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| over our target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| You're just saying that this verifies that your target areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| are the right target areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| What's NSP2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Just help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| It's Neighborhood Stabilization Program 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| It was the second round of funding that came out with the ARRA money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| We applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| We were not successful in getting a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| But it was more Neighborhood Stabilization money to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| foreclosed, abandoned, and vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| And we're essentially looking at Old Center City, whether that's north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| south, east?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Yes, without some neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| As you can note, downtown is not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| 4th and Gill is not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Those are neighborhoods that really don't need our assistance anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| There's enough private investment in downtown, in 4th and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| in parts of Old North Knoxville that, although we could possibly do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| some sort of project, it's not an area that needs a lot of our funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| And your goal is to have no black lines on this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| We want to be clear with the target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| We are not saying that these are the only areas in which we will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| but there are several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| We're analyzing right now which programs will be most effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| in targeting in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| And with 4th and Gill, if there's a particular chronic problem property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| that otherwise is not the economics are such that it's just not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| to happen with the market, then because there is so much strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| investment there, we can make a move like with Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| With the council's approval, we were able to acquire Luttrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| and now that's turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| It actually closed, I think, Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| And so that purchaser, the woman who bought that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| will start rehabbing that and will move in it soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| So we want it clear that this doesn't mean that we will not work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| in any other area, but we're going to be targeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| some of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| And if you're in that area, you might get a higher priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| say for owner-occupied rehab or a My Front Yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| But we may even drill down more and say within a particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| say within Oakwood-Lincoln Park, there may even be some parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| of Oakwood-Lincoln Park because we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| some chronic problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| A Chodo might be doing some infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Then we might say, okay, we're going to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| My Front Yards right around there so that those investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| that are occurring can be supported by more investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| So we just want that to be clear so you don't get calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| from everybody saying they'll never do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| in their neighborhood for five more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| That's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| But the idea you just described then helps stabilize that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| and is kind of an example to the next block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| What you can become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| This next map doesn't show up at all up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| You may be able to see it better in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| This is one of the maps that was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| for the Vacant Properties Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| And it shows several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| It shows, is this the text?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| This is the nuisance structures, nuisance lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Here, I'm up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| I got the wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| You got the wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| This is a map of nuisance properties, vacant lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| blighted structures based on codes, data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3182)|
| 0:53:09| And as you can see, it kind of overlays right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| into the target areas that we've designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3192)|
| 0:53:23| The next page shows the tax foreclosed properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| These are properties that have been to tax sales and sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| and then properties that are delinquent three or more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| Once again, you can see the overlay with the target areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| that we've chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| It also includes properties that didn't sell but are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| in the hands of the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| which are 60% of those that go to tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| How many parcels do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Do you remember that number, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| We may have to get back with you on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Under the ADA, are you required to make this print readable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Only if requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And you have to request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| How many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Three hours notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Yeah, we apologize for this, but we could get you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| all five by eight maps if you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| but wrap your walls on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| And the final map, once again, shows our target areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3263)|
| 0:54:31| with our redevelopment areas superimposed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| That's just because another reason for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| choosing these areas was to build on existing investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| and the work that's ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Just because this is a new five-year plan doesn't mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| we're going to stop doing what we're currently doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| We're going to continue working and finishing the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| the redevelopment plans that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| So all of our target areas encompass the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| neighborhood redevelopment and other redevelopment areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| that the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3305)|
| 0:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| You want to turn over to your next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| You will see, like I said, boiling down all this data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| we have to get to some local priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| goals and priorities within the HUD federal priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| So there's a table there that shows within the decent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| create suitable living environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| and create economic opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| we've identified five priorities of where we're going to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| our funds in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| The first one is home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| This is something we've been doing for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| and we will continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| It's to increase the supply of affordable owner-occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| housing, improve the quality and energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| of owner-occupied housing, improve access to fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| and affordable owner-occupied housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| and increase the supply of visitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| owner-occupied housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| Within rental housing, we will increase the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| of affordable rental housing, improve the quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| and energy efficiency, improve access to fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| and affordable housing, and increase the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| of visitable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Under homelessness, we will increase the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| of permanent supportive housing for persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| who are homeless, improve access to permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| supportive housing for persons who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| and provide supportive services for persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Under neighborhood stabilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| and that's under the next category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| that's creating a suitable living environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| Before you leave, when you say access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| is that the physical access things we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| the one or no steps, the 32-inch door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| It's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| We will improve access through a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| It can be through case management to get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| It can be financial assistance to get into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| This does not necessarily refer to accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Let me ask you about the rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Do you work with individual houses as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| as apartment complexes on energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| and all of that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| We, from time to time, do rental rehab programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| We work with, say, an owner of rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| Typically, there are people that aren't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| but they will rehab the housing with our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| through a loan and then pay us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Of course, we would require that they do Energy Star| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| or some sort of LEED for homes, Earthcraft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3486)|
| 0:58:15| Under neighborhood stabilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| we will mitigate the impact of vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| blighted, and foreclosed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| eliminate environmental hazards that impede redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| improve the safety and livability of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| through redevelopment revitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| strengthen neighborhoods by increasing the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| of resident stakeholder-led organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| support quality facilities and services available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| As you can see, that's a medium priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| We, over the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| our funds have been depleting, our federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| and we haven't been able to support facility improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| as in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| So, if money was available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| we would participate in that type project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3535)|
| 0:59:03| Promote the development of mixed-income neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| improve mobility and access to transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| That's through sidewalks or bus shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Under creating economic opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| increase access to economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| for businesses in low-mod income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| That would be our facade program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| as a prime example of one of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| that would fall in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Increase access to economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| for low-mod income persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| and remediate and redevelop brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Any questions about our local goals and our objectives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| What is that number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| the access to economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| for the lower-moderate income folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| You gave an example of the business one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| It would be a job training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| For example, we funded a couple of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| through the Empowerment Zone over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| So is that that green training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| you're giving to some young people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Is that part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| It's an example of that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| So given these goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| again remember that these are five-year goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| and we have to come up with goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| and priorities and strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| before we even know how much money might be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| And so you put out what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| One thing that does help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| even though, and we told folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| who came to our planning sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| listening sessions for this consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| we want to get all the needs here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| and what we would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| And then as money comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| you prioritize and figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| weighing a number of different factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| which we'll get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| But this is the big goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| And within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| there are a number of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| we can actually make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| And that's page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| These are potential projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| depending on the amount of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Madeline, before you get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| let's go back to economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| The third one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| I'm wondering, redevelops brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Are we working with the Development Corp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| and the Chamber to be helping in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Are we relying only on our own programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| in the Community Development Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| We work with the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| I meet out every two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| with the Mayor and the Chamber and KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| and we review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Because they obviously have some access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| to tools to help with the brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Okay, so you are coordinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| So for the housing programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| the CHODO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Community Housing Development Organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| the non-profit partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| they would fall under this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| The owner-occupied rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Down payment assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| for home ownership opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Education and counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| for homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| or potential homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Emergency home repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| We've done that for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| We have some partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| that we'll see in a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| that do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| The My Front Yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| that is the residential version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| of the Commercial Facade Program basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| It's up to $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| and a five-year deferrable loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| which basically means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| you can have that forgiven over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| And we've seen some wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| changes, exterior changes to homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| The homes have to meet some basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| minimum housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| If it's falling apart inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| we won't put a nice shiny outside on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| But for many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| that amount of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| has made a huge difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| for them and their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3757)|

| 1:02:55| Those types of activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| would fall under these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| housing goals and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3778)|

| 1:03:09| and I mentioned would now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| have program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| We could continue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| maybe eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| putting some CDBG dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3795)|

| 1:03:19| this is something that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| for, we acquire both residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| and commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| to mitigate the negative impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| and most of those have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3808)|

| 1:03:35| that's key to stabilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=3817)|

| 1:14:10| the programs that we have been working with and that we think will effectively meet those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| We're proposing that we put $250,000 into the Commercial Facade Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| I think a lot of you know the difference that has made at Broadway and Central, up Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| certainly Happy Holler and all the way up, Magpies, Colorama Building, all the buildings straight up Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| Also Magnolia, we've got several properties that are experiencing or that are having facades there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| We've got some in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| We consider that we've put about $3 million into facades between city dollars, CDBG dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4485)|
| 1:14:55| and mostly the Empowerment Zone dollars, a couple million of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| Those funds are going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Is there a per building limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Yes, each building, there's a maximum of $50,000, but it's based on square footage, so it might be less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| Also, 20% of the cost has to be contributed by the building owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| It's a five-year forgivable loan if you meet certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| Last year, because we allocated dollars through, we used CDBGR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4523)|
| 1:15:32| You remember on that first spreadsheet I showed you, CDBGR is funding facades at $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| so we actually didn't have it in our annual plan last year because we were funding it another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| but we want to put that back in because the Empowerment Zone funds will be gone, so recommending $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| Blighted property acquisition, it's a key strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| Because of the dollars that we have this year, we are lowering that amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| because we still have some from last year and some from the city funds that are all targeted for properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4560)|
| 1:16:08| and moving forward, but there is a time lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| It takes a while to get this done, and so we were comfortable that we could keep that program going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| with fewer dollars this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| One reason why we've got the money left is, again, we've been focusing on Empowerment Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| and getting those dollars spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| Number three, the Community and Economic Development Projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| That is the contingency fund if something goes over or something pops up unexpectedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| that needs a little bit of money that can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| That's why we put a little bit of money in there each year, and that's a little more than $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| Our Owner-Occupied Housing Rehab, we're recommending $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| You'll see that we put over a million in it down with the home dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| so a lot of our Owner-Occupied Rehab is through the home funds rather than the CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| We want to, again, put $100,000 in rental rehab, housing rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| Number six, the My Front Yard that I mentioned earlier, the exterior facade improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| That was all funded with Empowerment Zone, and by the time that's finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| we think we'll have probably close to 200 of those completed throughout the Empowerment Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| We think it's an effective targeted program, and so we're recommending $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| That would be 20, is that my math right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| About 20 projects might make a difference in some targeted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| Housing Activities Delivery, this is basically the staffing that is required to do all of the housing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| There's not a cap for that, like some admin costs, because this is staff time that is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| to actually do programs as opposed to planning and administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| So we're recommending $450,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| The CDBG admin is the non-housing admin that's developing the plan, having public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4683)|
| 1:18:13| monitoring sub-recipients, all that kind of work, a lot of what Becky's team does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| We are recommending $432,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| That's within that cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Number nine is Rental Rehabilitation for Permanent Support of Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| Every year, for several years, we have allocated funds to be in support of the 10-year planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| and chronic homelessness, and this would be the CDBG dollars for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| Number 10 is the Emergency Home Repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| CAC is our partner in that project, and we're recommending another $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| I can tell you that the demand is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| We could put $800,000, we could put a million dollars into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| and we wouldn't meet the need in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| I think they've already spent all their money for this year, and the fiscal year doesn't end until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| Just like houses that have leaky roofs or problems with windows, is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4750)|
| 1:19:18| Typically, it's major systems that need repair, whether it's heat, air, electric, plumbing, roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4758)|
| 1:19:27| So you're keeping them from going uninhabitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| That's correct, keeping a decent home, affordable home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| Many of these are elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Mr. Brown, you talked about elderly folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| A lot of folks are elderly or are persons with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| who don't have the resources to make these repairs on their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| Okay, number 11, Minor Home Repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| This is our partner, and this project is Neighborhood Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| They actually leverage a lot of volunteer help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| This is their Operation Backyard project that's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| It's usually in the spring and summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| So we're recommending $70,000 to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| The Ramps and Rails Program from Disability Resource Center, that is doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| We've had about $12,000, I think, the last two years, and there's a great demand by people who need rails and ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4816)|
| 1:20:25| It might be a person with a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| It might be a senior person who can no longer climb the steps up to the porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| So we're asking for $20,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Here's the Design Center, number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| They're our partner in providing the technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| We'd like to renew that this year at $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| That's an amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| It's less than last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| but Mr. Watson believes that that's a sufficient amount of money for them to continue what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| And number 14 is the Homeless Management Information System, the HMIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| which you all heard a lot about the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| This is the way to track individuals in the homeless service system in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| And we routinely contribute towards that, which is $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| Oh, no, it's greater than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| I don't know the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| I know the county contributes $10,000 as well to HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| Okay, so those are the CDBG funds and how we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| Let's see what they received last year and what we're proposing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| The home dollars, these are dollars targeted specifically for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| Where CDBG has a little more flexibility, there are more eligible uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| Home is more restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| And the rules are totally different, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| Number 15 is recommending over $1 million for owner-occupied housing rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| Remember, these are low-interest loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| They get paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| And we're able to continue with that program income to support other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| That's some of that $350,000 that we're anticipating as program income next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| Down payment assistance, this assists people who are purchasing a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| We're recommending keeping it at $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| $174,000 is the maximum we can put into administration for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| We're recommending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Here is our annual allotment for the permit support of housing to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4953)|
| 1:22:41| 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| We're recommending $250,000 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| And then 19 and 20 are funds that are allocated to the nonprofit housing partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| the Community Housing Development Organizations, or CHODOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| We're required to put a minimum amount down 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| And we typically do even more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| So we're recommending $450,000 for their construction of the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| and $50,000 for operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| Does Habitat fit into any of that 19 and 20, or is that something entirely different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| Habitat is not a CHODO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Knox Housing Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Neighborhood Housing Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| I'm drawing a blank here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| East Tennessee Housing Development Corporation, which spun off from the Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| Those are the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| And I believe CAC has recently formed as a CHODO as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5020)|
| 1:23:49| So any of them would be eligible and they work with our housing team to apply for those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| Okay, so the emergency shelter grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| This is, again, another funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| It's own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| It actually even is only certain percentages of each grant can go for certain services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5041)|
| 1:24:08| And if you want details, Becky can explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| But I'm going to move ahead and just then talk about the CAC Homeward Bound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5050)|
| 1:24:18| $9,000, Child and Family Crisis Center, $11,835.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| VMC for their day shelter housing first, $28,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| That was that small amount that Ms. Weatherstone mentioned the other night, the small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| YWCA, $12,000 for their transitional shelter residence program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| Samaritan Place, the Catholic Charities, $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| And the Crossroads Welcome Center for CARM, $12,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| We're allowed up to 5% for administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| This is just a teeny little point, a little bit of that that will apply towards admin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5093)|
| 1:25:00| because we got a little more than we had anticipated when we originally made the awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| And it's quite time-consuming to manage these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| So there you have the total emergency shelter grant and the grand total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| In addition, number 28 there, we also, through our fair housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| the investigations that our fair housing specialists do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| we get some money back as cases are closed in certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| And we're anticipating about $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| We supplement the staffing and the costs of that investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| and fair housing education with our CDBG funds that come out of the admin cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| that's listed number eight on your page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| So then if you go back to the page, we're almost finished here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| If you go back one page to the next steps, we will be receiving public comment on this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5150)|
| 1:26:01| when the plan, both the consolidated plan and the annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| when it was released a couple weeks ago, we announced that the public comment would be received by email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5165)|
| 1:26:17| postal mail, you know, call us on the phone and tell us, come to public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| We will record all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| And that does get included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| We will have our public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| I'm going to mention this again in case anybody is watching now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5190)|

| 1:26:42| Council will consider this plan at your meeting on April 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| And then we need to submit a plan to HUD by May 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| Typically this will start, then we await their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| And then we start, when that comes, this plan will start July 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| and we'll be bringing most of these, the ones that have subrecipients that are over $25,000, I guess it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| we bring those to you for your approval for the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| Let me just tell you what I passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| These pages are to replace the ones that are in your binder in the annual action plan section towards the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5235)|
| 1:27:25| The ones that are in there now were based on estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| and these are the actual proposed projects and accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| So the pages are numbered 7 through 12, and you can just pull out the other section and replace it with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5254)|

| 1:27:53| but here are some examples of our chronic problem properties on the left, top, and bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5273)|

| 1:28:04| The left has been demolished and the lot cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5284)|

| 1:28:16| You all have approved two of these, actually three acquisitions on MLK and the 2900 block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| and we'll be bringing the fourth one, the one on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5303)|

| 1:28:29| It's demolished, but we're still planning to acquire that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| We'll issue an RFP for development most likely for those four lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| and try to get something nice that will be a healthy and safe environment across from the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| and the people that live in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5321)|

| 1:28:59| Union Square Park, this is another way where we have put in the previous years some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| We're still finishing the project, and this is to improve that park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| while we're also doing significant residential improvements through the KCDC Park City duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5348)|

| 1:29:47| And it's had a good redevelopment using a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| This is a loan fund that gets paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5390)|

| 1:30:23| Again, these are loans, low-interest loans that people get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| and we work with them and help them get their home rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5427)|

| 1:31:42| Look at the difference on the added windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| Of course, our $50,000 only paid for a small portion of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| but it did help them make that project go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| Some more Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Okay, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| I know everyone's worn out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| As you prepare for a council meeting, if you have more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| please call me or call Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| We'd be glad to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| Questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| I had just one, if people don't shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| In any of those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| are there monies that facilitate private contractors to undertake the infill housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| In other words, you hear a lot of complaints that it's kind of a risky business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| You go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| The margins are tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Codes wears your butt out trying to get the things up to some modern standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| that it may not even be capable of reaching without ripping all the walls down and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| Is there some program we have that will kind of get those hungry builders to actually do some of the work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5568)|
| 1:32:56| whether we buy the houses at the end of the tunnel or make loans easier to get or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| One example is the Blighted Property Redevelopment Program that I mentioned was EZ-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| We showed a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| This is where a private developer, for speculation purposes if they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| or an individual family person, if they want to buy it and fix up a house themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| we will give you a development loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| A lot of these houses, you can't go to the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| If you've got a blighted house, you can't go to the bank to get a development loan, a construction loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| It's very difficult to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| There's no security for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| We give them a no-interest loan that is paid back, like a six-month loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| They go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| They can purchase the property if they don't already own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| They can do the rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| They can do it themselves, hire the private contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| And then when it's finished, they either sell the property and then pay us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| or they get their own long-term financing if they're planning to continue to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| So you're a bridge loan in that sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| We're basically the banker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| We're giving them the money to do the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| They pay us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| We're bridging between that and the long-term financing or the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| What about the city building codes people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Can they find a way to help facilitate older house rehabilitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| I can't really speak to the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| You control them, but are you working with them to find a way to make that kind of easier shopping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| Because I'm assuming that every time you touch an old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| it's got to be frustrating the amount of things that are under current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| But once you change about, what, 15% or 20% of the building's value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| you've got to come to current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Is there some rule like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| I'm going to defer to my construction folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5683)|
| 1:34:51| I think it's fair to say that it could be more clarity in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| Even for us, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| figuring out exactly how the building code applies to existing buildings is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| I think that's an impediment we actually list in our consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| We're in discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| We have a good working relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| I think that's something, as we learn more about it, we could share with contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| We use private contractors on all the My Front Yard projects and our owner-occupied rehabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| I know a lot of them have come to me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| during this time, we're the only work they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| There's probably a lot of hungry builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| If we can find a way to make this sort of attractive, we may get more done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| As he said, we are using them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| That's the model, is to use the private contractors to come in and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| I have one comment to make on the emergency shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| and that's about the Samaritan's Place Catholic Charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| I had an occasion to use that when I was a caregiver for my mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| and they are an excellent place for people who need relief who are caregivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| So I just wanted to mention that, that I have used that as an excellent place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| Other comments before we go into public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| Any discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Well, let's move into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| We have one person signed up, Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Ron, come on up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| I just have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Ms. Wade, you made, or Ms. Rojero, made the comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| I'm not sure which one of you actually said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| and referring to page 12, federal funds have been depleting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| What exactly does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| I think you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| I don't know who said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| I think Ms. Wade did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| What I meant was our federal funds have been going down for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| We are actually not fully funded with CDBG fund based on our formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| On the other hand, we've also gotten new funds, such as the stimulus funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| We've had almost $6 million worth of new funds this year that we never got before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| But the standard annual funds that you get, the CDBG, the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| at one time there was twice as much CDBG as there is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| And the stimulus money we're going to receive for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| Three to four, depending on the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Generally speaking, the kind of the total package, the HUD money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| were like half of what it was eight years ago, ten years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| I don't know the exact figure, but I can get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| And then the only other question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| And I should also say that there are other opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| there are proposals out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| there are several initiatives that are starting, whether we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| you know, through the Obama administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| So there may be more funds coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| We don't know yet at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| You know, actually, that actually answered both questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| So you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Thank you, Mr. Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| Is there anybody else who wants to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| Mr. Grave, you look like you had something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| What I saw in there also is that you are looking to possibly do another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5919)|
| 1:38:46| supportive housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| And that's projected just based on previous projects that we funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| and the ten-year plans long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| So it will be set aside in this budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| That is what it's for in our budget that we will submit to HUD, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| And then the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Can it be used for other things if a project is not ready at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| It can be with certain restrictions depending on what the other project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| We might have to do an amendment to our plan that requires some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| But, yeah, even though none of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| we're not locked into any of these things, basically, is the answer, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| I mean, this is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| The plans can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| And what we do, and I mentioned earlier that when we identify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| when we develop our plan, we look at the mayor's priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| we leverage with other departments on what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| And as I mentioned, actually, at the council meeting the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| you know, the administration and the ten-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| our department have all been committed to homelessness issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| and particularly chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| So we set aside a certain amount of money every year for that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| and for a project to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| You know, we don't drive the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| We provide the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| You know, and the ten-year plan is who really comes up with the strategy for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| But we, some of our funding supports other city initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| and this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| Have you, either of you gone to Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| and seen if there's a human being with hundreds of these notebooks reading them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| I would tell you that with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| both of us have been to Washington several times dealing with the stimulus dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| and it is amazing what, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| I have a lot of compassion for the HUD staff who all of a sudden got billions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6052)|
| 1:40:59| that within six weeks they had to come up with plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| This is for the neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| It was pretty close with the second stimulus last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| So there's a lot of furious activity going on to figure out how to develop plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6069)|
| 1:41:17| and spend money quicker than you ever have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| but with greater accountability and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| It's been a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| The reason I ask that is I try to sit and read this without a very sharp pencil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| in case I fell over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| It's full of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| It's our cure for insomnia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| It is repetitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| I want to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| I want to thank you and your staff for, I think, a very fine job, good presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| The bus tour was very informative, and it's a lot of work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| and you all seem to be doing a good job with it, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| And there's a great staff at Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| A few of them are here that you've got to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Yeah, I would like to thank Mark Rigsby and Emily Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| They worked on the tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Some other people did, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| They're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| But, I mean, it takes a lot of work to get that together, mapping it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| driving it, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| I have two sort of historical perspectives, having gone through this a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| And one thing that I learned is that all of the things that we approve next week at council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| in the one-year plan actually come back again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| because as each project is funded then it comes through in a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| So it's nice as a council member to have an opportunity to continue to revisit it throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| and kind of get updates as that funding goes out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| The other thing is just to thank the Community Development staff for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| Every year that we have seen it under your direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| it has gotten more concise, it's gotten more focused, it's tighter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| and I think better focused on the critical priorities that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| Six years ago it felt like buckshot, and now it feels very targeted and very strategic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| So that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| Pray for sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| Pray for sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| Pray for sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| I think we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| You all have a nice weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-apr-0810?start=6200)|
