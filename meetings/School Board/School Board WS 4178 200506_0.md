| 0:08:40| not at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=520)|

| 0:08:43| One thing I like about these zoom calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| I can take them from my kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=524)|

| 0:08:54| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| superintendent Thomas and staff have done to keep the staff and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| students safe through COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=538)|

| 0:09:02| For all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| we've been in public health plan for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| for years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| but never anticipated what it would really be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| If we actually had a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| So now it's really here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| We're all learning and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Changing based on information and data and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Uh, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| learning from what we learned from other places and learning from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| What we learned from the CDC and the world health organization on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| to best protect our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| And I'm really happy that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| that you've come up with a good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Graduation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| I know that's not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Obviously you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Such an alteration to graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Um, but we have the students remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| At least one thing, it'll be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| A different graduation for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| So that that'll be worth some memories anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| I'm on tonight just to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| Um, you know, right now we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Our primary focus is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Contact tracing and case reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| So it's new cases come up group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| It contacting everyone who is potentially at risk for being ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| because of that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| And asking them questions, giving them guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| putting them in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Telling them how long they need to be in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| So the whole idea behind contact tracing is we find all those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| that are at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Um, and, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| And people are being really cooperative as you can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| Um, because they don't want to make anybody sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| And, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| I've got to let my dog out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| On the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| And that means let me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| We've got to do our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| We've got to do our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=658)|

| 0:11:18| We've got to do our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| I think that that's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| I think that's the truth is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| We don't do this properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| The first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| We're going to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Going backwards, which is just going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| Even more frustrating for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| This is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Frustrated in the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| But we've got to take this slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| And little baby steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| So that we don't have to take big steps backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| It's kind of the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| I'm happy to answer any questions you have about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Local situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=707)|

| 0:11:59| Yeah, and I guess this is for Dr. Buchanan or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| Superintendent Thomas. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| exactly which parts of the graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| plan were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=729)|

| 0:12:13| this email just went out and I've already gotten like 10 messages about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| So a couple of my questions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| you know, the concern being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| here in South Knoxville, we're really close to Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| And some of the questions I'm getting are, you know, well, Maryville High School is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| a graduation on May 29th and limiting to parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| you know, and parents aren't really understanding why parents can't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| Especially with, I guess my question is, with this being the end of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| first of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| I mean, we're getting really close to school starting back then. I mean, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| like set in stone? Can we, will this be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| maybe changing? It's hard to believe that we can't let parents see graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| and then we're going to be starting school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| not that long after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| So I'm just kind of curious about that, if there's, like the way we do churches and maybe mark off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| places or rows for family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| I'll let Mr. Myers or I don't know if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| I don't remember the gentleman's name, Danny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| They, the gentleman wrote the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| Yeah, Bob, you want me to come on or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Sure, sure, Danny, if you'll join us. Yeah, let me find my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| You know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Can you tell them? Hang on just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=827)|
| 0:13:57| Okay, Christy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| when we did that initial plan, when we met Dr. Buchanan yesterday, that's what we had in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| but it's what she advised us, and correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| was that we would go back and look at this in July, and it depends on what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| you know, the numbers are, and she said that we would, you know, consider safety and data first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| And if it's where we can bring the parents, you know, we have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| But, you know, right now to get something out and get a plan, this is the plan we came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| So I think to answer your questions, there is a possibility that, you know, we could have parents there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| if we're out of the different phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| And Dr. Buchanan, do you want to weigh in on that or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| did I say it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| Sure, no, absolutely. You're correct. I think so much depends on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| what happens between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| We don't have, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| I don't have a crystal ball that's going to tell me what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| And so much is in the hands of our community right now, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| We've written guidelines that I think are safe and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| We are depending on our community to follow those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| in order to not have to take steps back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| And I realize the guidance in the state is different than the guidance in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| But I, as the health officer, I have the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| recommend different guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| we're making those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| We made recommendations to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| shelter at home sooner than others did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| And that's part of why our case count has stayed low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| I really believe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| social distancing, washing your hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| limiting people, people's interactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| are a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| are evidence-based ways to decrease illness. I get that parents are frustrated and upset and confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| And I hate that we're having to make these tough choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| But we have to make these tough choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| in order to even hope to open school in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| If we don't do the right thing, we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| find ourselves in a situation where we can't even have school in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| So we have to do the right thing between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| And that means making hard choices and making some sacrifices and doing things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| It's just not, business as usual, it's not an option. We need to be really conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=975)|
| 0:16:26| Susan, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Somebody has a lot of feedback if anybody can check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Okay, Chrissy, did that answer your question before I move to other board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Yeah, I think so. I think there's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| maybe we need to get out some clear communication about the differences because, you know, you do see neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| counties do more, like just about every surrounding county has already announced something for their resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| And it just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| I don't know if people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| get why it's different in Knox County than it is in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| neighboring counties. And maybe that's something we need to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| do a better job at communicating. But yeah, for the most part it answered, I think, my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| Okay, I know Mr. McMillan, Ms. Bounds, and Ms. Babb all have questions. Let's go to Mr. McMillan first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| all due respect, you do an amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| But I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| that we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| better than 10 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Weather is getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| warmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I know all of us hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| things improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| if they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| would you consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| making some type of adjustment from your standpoint to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1083)|
| 0:18:12| the family to participate in some way, minor way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| Certainly. So, you know, those decisions will be made ultimately by school administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| based on local guidance from public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| And so, you know, we will look at the data and we are looking at the data every day. That's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| we looked at the data to decide to open things up a little bit. But we just have to kind of crack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| the door open a little bit and take it step by step. And we, in our plan, we do allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1121)|
| 0:18:50| mid-phase adjustments or phase adjustments. So there are possibilities for us to make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| based on how it's going, based on how many people are sick and how overwhelmed the system is or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| and all of the things that we're looking at. So certainly there's consideration for reconsidering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| if the data indicates that we should do that. Absolutely. Well, obviously we couldn't wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| until like the week before or something. But, you know, people would need a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1156)|
| 0:19:25| as far as expectations, I think, because you might have some people coming in from out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| whatnot. But I guess based on what you were saying, ultimately, would it come down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1173)|
| 0:19:44| if you disagree and if the superintendent and the board was of another mind or opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1184)|
| 0:19:55| to allow at least families to participate, one or two members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1195)|
| 0:20:07| Was that what you were referencing? It's certainly the board's and the superintendent's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| on how they move forward. We have always enjoyed a really cooperative relationship and I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| continues. But, you know, I do, depending on the conditions, and I know Superintendent Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| is not going to make a rash decision. He's a very thoughtful man and really wants to protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| students and the families as well. So I trust that he and his staff will make thoughtful decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| based on the data that's available and I trust that you all make thoughtful decisions. You've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| made thoughtful decisions all along and you'll continue to do that. Nobody's going to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| crazy or rash decision. If we see cases going up, nobody's going to say, oh, we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1248)|
| 0:20:56| open it up and let everybody come. And you're not asking that either. So I think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| you know, the relationship we have with the school administration and the Board of Education is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| good one and we work in partnership. So ultimately, yes, you all can make that decision if you decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| to do something different. You can do that. Sure. Yes. I think you're correct in your assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1275)|
| 0:21:25| I know that the superintendent, nor his staff, nor the board would do anything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1285)|
| 0:21:35| jeopardize students or parents. But with that said, this is such an important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1295)|
| 0:21:48| that to some people, to some people, to the student in particular, that I only learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1308)|
| 0:22:01| about an hour and a half ago about the plans. With that said, I think I will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1321)|
| 0:22:11| since we meet next week, I think we will, I'm sure other people will have possibly some suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1331)|
| 0:22:21| but I will have some to offer that might be a minor adjustment, but would include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1341)|
| 0:22:32| at least some of the family. And it can be, you know, tossed around by board members or staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| superintendent, or just tell me I'm crazy, whatever. But with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1360)|
| 0:22:49| I just, I feel like this is one of the most important days in the student's life. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1369)|
| 0:22:59| I haven't gotten any calls yet, but I feel like what Ms. Christie was saying, I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1379)|
| 0:23:10| that there are plenty of my people that will be calling. And to be quite honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1390)|
| 0:23:20| they're not, unless things turn for the worse, they're not going to, in my opinion, accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1400)|
| 0:23:34| some bureaucrats, and I don't mean this directed toward any one person or group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1414)|
| 0:23:44| that they're not willing to accept that without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1424)|
| 0:23:54| complaining and complaining loudly. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you, Mike. Patty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| turn your volume on, Patty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| It just needs to unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Patty, here we go. Okay, start over. We couldn't hear you, Patty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Okay. Sorry. You don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| Do you, Patty, do you still have it on on your iPad too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| No, I have it all on my phone to hear, on my computer to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| Okay, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| You need to mute one of those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Yeah, mute one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Not that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| We can't hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| Just, now can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1497)|
| 0:25:14| Patty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1516)|
| 0:25:27| Okay. Patty, Virginia has a question. Let's, let me go to her, and then we'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1527)|
| 0:25:35| Well, I'm wondering if maybe Patty could text her question to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| and let someone else ask it for her since the audio is so, she doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| I've asked her to do that. Yeah, I've asked her to text me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Okay. Do you want to wait for her question or you want me to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Just go ahead, Virginia, and that would be great, Patty, if you can text your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| You can even text it on here on the chat thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| That box, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Sure, and with Dr. Buchanan, I mean, obviously, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| we want to listen to the medical experts, which is what your office is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| I mean, I have no medical background, and I know what we would like for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| but we do need to look to you for advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| One thing I guess I have a question about is the date that was come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| kind of the end of July, August, where did that date come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| I'll let school administration answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Okay, Danny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Danny, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Yes, what we did, I think phase three, if everything goes right, would be July 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| or 23rd, and so that's kind of why we chose that late date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| and we know that that would be extremely warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| I will tell you that we've researched the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| I can tell you how much rain or what the temperature is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| and we chose early and late graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| We've got, you know, bottled water for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| We've got box fans, the whole nine yards if we have to go that late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| I mean, I think if we had a preference, we would love to go in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| but we didn't think that was feasible with some of the things that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| so Dr. Buchanan, you want to follow up on that, or is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| Dr. Buchanan, if I may, just tag on to kind of combining those other two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| If we do it toward the end with those dates, at the end of July going into August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| do you feel like that there would be a higher possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| I know you don't know, but do you think that there would be a higher possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| that maybe parents, you know, we could have parents there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| I think that would be the ultimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| If we had to wait, that would be, you know, what we would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| It certainly increases the chance that you could allow a limited number of people to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| So waiting later does increase that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| No guarantees, but it does increase that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| I guess I'd just like to follow up on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| I think maybe this is one way Knox County schools can help with the messaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| from the health department is these parents that we know are going to want to be at graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| reminding them they're going to be part of the solution to helping that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| I mean, the more that everybody can do what the health department's telling us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| the more likelihood it is we can get back to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| we can get them to see their graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| So maybe we can sort of help with that messaging to sort of realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| this is all we can offer right now because we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| I mean, I realize the health department, you don't know what's going to happen two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| But, you know, with what we do know, the best we can offer is the plan that's going out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| But if maybe people will do what they're supposed to do and we can keep it contained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| maybe it will allow for some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| But I think also people have to realize if this becomes rampant again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| it all might get canceled and we don't want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Absolutely. Danny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Just to let you all know, we've started going to a few schools and walking the stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| I can tell you how many bleachers there are and how long they are and how many people we can get on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| them and we've done all that with the social distancing, trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| And in the next week, we're going to schedule more visits and we will walk every school stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| with the principal and their graduation team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| And then what we're going to talk about while we're there is if we had parents there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| what would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| And then each school is going to submit a very detailed and organized plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| which we would review and vet through Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And then we will be able to message that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| So, you know, we would love to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| It's just going to depend on a lot of factors, but we're going to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| Superintendent Thomas has challenged me with a bunch of plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| so we're trying to deliver the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| And I think that the bottom line message is that for the parents of seniors out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| is that we want to have graduation as much as you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| Like maybe not as much, but like really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| Like we really, really, really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| And so we just have to be patient and we have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| And I know that Mr. Trent has put in many hours working on this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| and he has a lot more that he will be working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| So, Danny, thank you for all your time and effort that you've put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| And thank you, Superintendent, for your commitment to wanting to hold graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| We know that that's so important to our students and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Yes, Mr. Trent, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Carly Harrington has been instrumental on her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| And then my two colleagues, I want to praise them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Tommy Watts and Salih Reynolds and John Reiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| There's been a whole lot of people and principals really gave us most of these ideals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| So shout out goes to them, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| Well, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| This, you know, there's so much more going on kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| with our team behind the scenes than what the public can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| And so I know that you're all putting in so many more hours than people would even realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| So thanks to all those folks that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| And any other questions for Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1878)|
| 0:31:18| I do, and I don't know if this is for Dr. Buchanan or just for our team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| but since we're still on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| When we start our summer programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| I know we talked about opening up the schools to community organizations on June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| What does lunch pickups are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| What are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| What does that look like from the health department side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| and also Knox County school sites with the distribution of food pickups and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| Is there a plan around that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| I will totally let the schools take that answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| because they've done a great job so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| with how they've organized that and gotten that taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| And so I trust that they'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Well, I know that within the schools, it's not necessarily Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| but I guess the question is, will we just follow what the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| because I know the health department gives the white boxes that you get for food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1928)|
| 0:32:17| We have an agenda item later that we can probably come back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| because we're going to, I think we have an agenda item to approve the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| summer nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Okay, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Madam Chair, Ms. Bounds would like to say the following comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| My concern when I received the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| was that students had to leave after receiving their diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Surely students should be allowed to stay until all students have received their diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| She finds it troublesome for the name to receive theirs in an empty stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| If your last name were to start with Z, there would be no one there to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| So that's her concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| That's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1989)|
| 0:33:09| That's certainly a valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| You know, again, I'll go back to this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| and I'm overusing this word, but this is an unprecedented time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| and we can't, our expectations have to be changed for this period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| in order for our community to move forward and continue to open and to have the hope of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| and again, this is the plan as it stands now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| You know, we've pushed it out far enough that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| you know, the other message would be to get your kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| especially your 20-somethings, to also follow the guidelines and wear their mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| Because they're an important part of infection control as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| And those are all valid concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| I hate to not have parents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I hate to think about the graduate having to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| and not be there to see his or her fellow graduates receive their diplomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| But we, you know, those are all challenging things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| And I'm hoping that everything will go better than I expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| but will go well and people will abide by the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| And, you know, by July we'll be a little more relaxed about how we can handle things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| I'm hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Dr. Buchanan, I have one more question that doesn't relate to graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| Two weeks from today, we have a budget meeting or hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| to consider spending, I guess, approximately three quarters of a billion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2090)|
| 0:35:00| Now, I know we've announced that all meetings will be in the month of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2100)|
| 0:35:09| will be by Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| But since it involves a very, very limited number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| and we've seen the problems that we've had here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| could we not have that actually either in the AJ and scatter out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2124)|
| 0:35:33| or have it in the main assembly room and scatter board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| scatter out, everybody practice social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| And when you're talking about money and that sort of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| it's, there'll be a little bit of arguing, I'm relatively sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| It would be so much better, I guess, from the board's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| if, would you consider opposing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2162)|
| 0:36:10| That's actually guidance from the state and actually guidance from the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and exception to rules for local meetings and local elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| So that is actually a call of the school's administration and the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| That is not a call of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| You don't have anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| So you have to be able to follow the recommendations as written by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| and for gatherings of elected bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| I haven't read those, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| I know they made some exceptions to be able to allow y'all to meet virtually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| but that will actually be a decision this body can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| as long as you can follow all the social distancing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| I think there are more than 10 people on this call, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| So I think that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Well, there are, and there'll be more than 10 people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| but they wouldn't necessarily be in the same room more than 10 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2221)|
| 0:37:09| At one time, and it was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| I might be wrong, but that the governor had said that the counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| that had their own health departments would attempt to follow the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| of the health departments or make adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| And that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| No, no, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| That's in regards to reopening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| And it is a little, it is not a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| It's a lot confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| I'll just own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| However, when it comes to elected bodies and what they can and can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| our plan is silent on that, except to set out general guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| for different kinds of business meetings or elected body meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| and having to follow the guidelines as far as social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| wearing a face mask if needed and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| And then the state made some changes and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| regarding elected bodies and how they could meet or not meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| And again, I'm sure that the school administration and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| have looked at that guidance and can understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| and interpret it based on the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| We are specifically writing guidance focused a lot on businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| and reopening businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| not so much on how elected bodies carry out their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| That's been more governed by the state and by the bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2325)|
| 0:38:45| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| I guess, Mr. Trent or Superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| do you know of any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| have you seen any guidelines from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| that would prohibit us from meeting, like I said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| I would need to look, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I have not seen anything, but that's not been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| from what guidelines have been published,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| it looked like it was not possible to do if it was more than 10 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| So maybe Mr. Duper may have more information on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| but I'd be glad to do the, if he doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| we'll do the research on it and find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| if we do it, what's the penalty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| But we'd be glad to do a little bit more research on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| and try to get an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| I can't imagine there being any penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| but I appreciate you looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| I think with what we're going to be talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| it's just so much better to be able to see each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| We'll look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Okay, any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Madam Chair, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| I can say that I have read that executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| I mean, there could be a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| but I can tell you that it would certainly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| a lot more complicated than what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| With only 10 people per room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| you'd have to be looking at multiple rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| You'd have to be looking at still using electronics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| So like Superintendent Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| we can take a look at it conjunctively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| but this is certainly a much more simpler solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| to that executive order versus some type of hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| which is what I think we'd be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Okay, thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Dr. Buchanan, thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| We appreciate your partnership with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| And I know you work so closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| with the superintendent and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| And so we appreciate that and appreciate your guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2469)|
| 0:41:09| Well, thank you for inviting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I truly appreciate the partnership with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| And whether you're aware of it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| it does not exist across our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| that the health department and the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| have such a good working relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| So we appreciate the partnership as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| So thank you and have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Thank you, you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Okay, we will turn to the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| of our regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| You should have received an email yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| regarding the addition of item 5C9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| a consideration of an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| for the use of the grouping pro application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| The agreement and fiscal note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| are attached to the electronic agenda for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| And also, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| we have received several questions regarding item 8A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| the one-to-one device deployment proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| A list of questions and answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| were shared with you via email earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| And that has also been attached to the electronic agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| for the public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| So if you're watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| and you wanna see that attachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| that is on the meeting notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| or the agenda item, I'm sorry, the agenda tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| And you can find that under item 8E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| and it answers a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| that we've received from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| regarding the one-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| So with that, we will go ahead and begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| Do we have any questions on contracts one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2568)|
| 0:42:57| Okay, three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2577)|
| 0:43:07| Five or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| I've got a question on five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Okay, go ahead, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| And this is mainly for Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| You know, Gary, given our discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| about Title IX and the equity concepts and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| is there something in that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| that would affect an approval of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| that obviously is gonna give an advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| to one sport over another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| It's a good question, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| And fortunately, I've gone out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| and I've talked to Principal Rob Spees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| out at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| I've also talked to the athletic director out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| And Hardin Valley, similar to West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| has a more comprehensive foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| athletics foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| And they are looking at sports across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| not just one particular sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| So I had the same concern that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| but after meeting with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| after looking at the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| again, they are looking at a more holistic approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| So I don't see that as a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| for this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Madam Chair, I have a question regarding item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Now that I know what department we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Yes, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2693)|
| 0:44:53| That's for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| She just had all the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| so I figured she would be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| So Superintendent Thomas, or whoever may answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| how will this go about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Is it going to be similar to what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| with the pickups now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| And is that going to be the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| for parents to come pick up the boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| during the summertime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Yeah, I don't know if Mr. Oaks has any more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| or if Brett, our child nutrition director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| is on the line to help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| From my understanding, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| it'll be done the traditional way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| But knowing that things are different today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| I feel more comfortable maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| if either Ms. Brett Foster or Mr. Oaks addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| And you asked a question a few minutes ago about facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| I know it's not exactly part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| but I'd just like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| we've been in conversation with folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| that utilize our buildings for daycare kinds of activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| So we expect those to be made available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| to the folks that we have contracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| and have contracts with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| One thing that I need to be getting back to the board on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| is a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2762)|
| 0:46:02| They've asked for a waiver of fees for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| and understandably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| But trying to get folks back to work as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| And so we're working with our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| on providing facilities like we have done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| as long as the guidelines provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| by the health department are adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| But let me go back to the CAC question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| And I don't know, Mr. Oaks, if you've got a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Yes, Brett's on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| And we'll be doing this similar to the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| that we've done in previous numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| but I'll let her walk through the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| of how we do that with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Okay, so we will be transitioning to summer feeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| starting on May 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| And I have been working with CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| and it is their intention for the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| that are allowed to operate in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| or other locations to be able to utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| the same model we have always in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| where CAC will deliver the meals to those sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| and they will have it as a part of their programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| But we've also been working on trying to locate sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| to do motel pickups that are close to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| And so it won't be the exact same sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| but I have been working with CAC to identify areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| where they can set up a mobile meal pickup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| for families that are not participating in programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| to pick up meals if they would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2858)|
| 0:47:38| It's the mobile aspect that I would like to get clarity on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| versus just the traditional way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| because I'm familiar with the traditional way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| but the mobile aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| because I know a lot of summer programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| might not even happen this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| And so there's still kids out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| that will need that type of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| So whenever you get that full clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Well, they have been working on setting up sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| based on our meal count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| So I've been sending those to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| so they know how many to possibly expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| And we talked about possibly doing a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| to see how many families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| and what sites they would be most interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| so we can better plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| since it is a different model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| than what we've done in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| But their intention is to kind of follow the same model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| we have at least through June 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| because that's how long the waiver lasts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| for us to be able to do mobile meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| which it may be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| But at least through June 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| it is their intention to follow a very similar model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| to what we've been doing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| with a Monday, Wednesday pickup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| with multiple meals at each pickup time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Thank you, Ms. Foster, for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Any other questions on six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Item seven or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Okay, Mr. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Can somebody talk to us about what kind of reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| we'll get back from this benchmarking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| What this benchmarking does is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| we have some reception and transmission issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| in some of our buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| with our E911 digital system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| and the way some of our buildings are constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| helps or hinders that transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| So the intent with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| is the company will analyze each of our sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| for signal strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| and then come back and identify for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| the specific areas we need to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| or the specific corrections we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| in order to be able to have a reliable signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| throughout the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| And I know I had some instability on my connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| I don't know if y'all heard all that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Any other questions on item seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Did y'all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Yes, we heard you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Any questions on eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| Okay, questions on nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| We have Mr. Cantrell and Ms. Harper from Bluegrass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| who are on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| Would one of you like to just briefly tell us about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| just so that board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| and other school-wide folks are aware of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3049)|
| 0:50:57| Mr. Cantrell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Yeah, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Okay, my internet's going in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| So this is a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| We're here tonight to kind of give a brief overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| It's a grouping program that helps in the distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| of students in the classes for the next new school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| So in a nutshell, if you're familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| with the elementary world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| you may know that the process is daunting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| it's time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Teachers are filling out handwritten cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| for each student and then standing around several hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| trying to create the perfect class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| And then the admin, they would sit around for hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| with these hundreds of cards at a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| trying to make sure the classes have an equal number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| of boys, girls, it's equitable distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| of high, average, low students, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| So what the program does is it takes a group of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| and it's a group of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| it's a group of administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| it's a group of administrators, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| So what the program does, everything's on the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| Teachers receive an email questionnaire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| that the principals create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| The teacher will mark those questionnaires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| their dropdown menus, it's done in 15 or 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Then the principal just simply groups it from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| by clicking a button which distributes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| and then fine tune those classes however they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| There's graphs, visuals that help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| make the best decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| And really, Ms. Harper, I feel the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| couldn't have gotten completed at a better time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| because it really does support social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| everything can be done from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| And so we actually had the privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| of sharing the program with Knox County technology teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| with Mr. Dupler to kind of look over it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| and get a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| We wanted to share it with the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| just kind of get your approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| on letting all Knox County principals use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| And of course, obviously with us working for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| we feel like we are Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| That program would never be any charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| to our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| Of course, we provide all the training support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| needed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| And the tech team has already offered support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I know through Aspen and those types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| So if you have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| we'll be happy to answer any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Sounds like it would be a huge help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| to principals and elementary teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| Okay, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| We'll move on to board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| So you should have the attached resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| that lists several policies that we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| that the resolution states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| that we would be temporarily suspending those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| for the remainder of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Any questions on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| Okay, moving on to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| Any questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Okay, C or, let's see, C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3249)|
| 0:54:21| Okay, moving into regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| Questions on B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Questions on D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| Yes, I just wanted to address some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| that I've received about concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| And I mean, I've talked to Mr. Oaks about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| but I just would like it publicly discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| just so that people who've asked the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| know that the discussion's gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| About, obviously, I'm very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| that we found some property for the elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| for Northwest Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| There are some concerns for some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| about the road issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| And I guess it's real narrow roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| and, you know, putting a school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| And then actually I saw some people on Facebook today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| talking about also there's a housing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| going up also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| So there's gonna be a lot more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| on the existing roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| So if Mr. Oaks could just address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| and what he has found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| about how that should be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| by the time the school is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| Mr. Oaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| Yes, Madam Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| First, I'd like to say we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| this is a really good site for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| and its location geographically we think is very sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| The road network going into it is not perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| but it is not dissimilar from road networks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| that we have schools on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| and we operate on in different areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| Currently, on the end of Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| where this property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| we can access largely through Reagan Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| but the county also has an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| of Terra Halla Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| from Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| into Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| which enters Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| basically at our property site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| And that extension of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| has been green-lighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| and it has been funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| And the county engineering indicates to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| that it will probably be finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| or they expect it to be finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| well before we even begin construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3421)|
| 0:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Can I ask just one follow-up question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| So I continue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| that will allow us several different ways to access the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| There's also a planned extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| further to the north of Terra Halla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| that would take it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| or provide it access to Mississippi North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| One follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Is the extension, the Terra Halla, I believe, road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| it's a county project that's being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| Yes, ma'am, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Okay, so the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| y'all have been in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| and the county feels like it will be finished sufficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| to meet the needs of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Yes, ma'am, I got that information directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| from Jim Snowden, Director of County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| Okay, thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3501)|
| 0:58:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| And then we'll move to our final item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| regarding one-to-one student device deployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Mr. Thomas, would you like to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| and start this conversation, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| I just wanted to briefly set the stage for this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| because I know there's a great deal of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| not only from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| but also from our students and families and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| Let me begin by saying that providing an electronic device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| to every student is not intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| and now let me repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| is not intended to replace the work of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3536)|
| 0:58:56| We know there's not a replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| for a teacher in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| But in the last few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| many of us have participated in meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| using Zoom or other online platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| And I think we've all realized how much is lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| when you can't meet in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| And even Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| I think made a good point with that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| At the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| we do believe that technology can help teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| enhance instruction and improve student engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| not only during an extended closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| but also in the traditional classroom setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| During the extended closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| one of our primary concerns has been our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| to provide equitable and accessible instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| to all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| We would hope that this will help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| to resolve that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| And certainly you have to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| that not only every student has a computer or laptop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| but also has access to the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| Given the uncertainty around COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| we believe it's important to prepare for the possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| I'll say the possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| that our campuses could be closed again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| at some point during the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Providing a device to every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| also known as becoming a one-to-one district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| will allow us to give our students the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| and materials that they need for remote learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Specifically, our hope is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| as providing a device to every student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| would give us more options during an extended closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| including the ability to cover new material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| or give mandatory assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| And those have been a couple of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| that I know have been concerning to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| concerning to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| and also concerning to our parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| So we want to be able to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| we can introduce new material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| and have mandatory assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| And this would allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| If we are able to open as planned in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| we believe there are still advantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| to providing every student with an electronic device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| The use of technology is essential requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| in the 21st century job market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| The community expects our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| to understand technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| and it's clear that these skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| will be important for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| whatever their future plans might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| I'd also point out that we've been discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| technology enhancements for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| and literally that's years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| but have largely relied on parents and fundraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| And we are very appreciative of parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| and the fundraisers to allow this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| But this proposal gives us the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| to fund such an effort at the district level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| where it really, it should be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| and free up dollars at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| From a teaching and learning perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| we believe this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| could extend learning opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| beyond the traditional school day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| would also give us additional flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| for responding to closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| related to inclement weather or the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| And finally, it's been helpful to watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| as many of our post-secondary partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| including institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| like the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| and Pellissippi State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| have made the transition to online instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| While the logistics of K-12 education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| are obviously very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| from the college setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| we do believe that their success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| with the remote learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| could be an example for our school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| I do appreciate the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| to share some brief thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| about this important proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| And with that, I know Mrs. Gail Bayard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| our Chief Technology Officer is online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| and also Dr. Ryswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| our Assistant Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| and Chief Academic Officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| that can talk a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| about the details of the initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| So if board permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| I know you may have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| and we'll certainly be glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| to address those too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| but I would like to give Mrs. Bayard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| an opportunity to talk about the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| and also Dr. Ryswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| to talk about the implementation and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| So thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Thank you, Seth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| Gail, take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| I've got the easy part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| I'm going to talk to you about devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| And honestly, the real work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| is going to be under John's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| But as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| we've been doing one-to-one technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| to some extent in this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| in a pilot sort of setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| But since that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| and since the initial devices were purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| we have seen a surge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| in the use of Chromebooks in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| And like Mr. Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| that's primarily because school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| activity funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| parent organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| foundations have purchased them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| It's not the General Purpose Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| that's been funding those devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| We currently have about 40,000 Chromebooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| in use in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| That's the good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| The bad news is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| they reach an end of life at a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| and we're slowly or very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| I guess, approaching that end of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| Most of our existing Chromebooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| will go out of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| at the end of next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Those devices that have been paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| with hard-earned fundraiser monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| will no longer be supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| by the operating system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| We have a lot of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| with the Chromebooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| and particularly the newer model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| of those older ones that I described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| What we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| with the CARES Act funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| is an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| to provide a current device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| for students that will last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| at least five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| The devices that we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| are guaranteed to be under support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| until June of 2026.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| So we're really proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| taking the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| of providing student devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| off of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| and parent organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Using these one-time dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| we can create a sustainable technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| line item in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| We are proposing enough devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| for every student, K-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| and to pay for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| over three budget years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| even though we expect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| to last at least five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| In K-2, we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| that has been the source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| of some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| We have proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| a slightly more expensive device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| that has touchscreen capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| and can actually operate as a tablet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| for the primary grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| In addition to the student devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| we want to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| a sustainability account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| to replace staff devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| on a five-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| We would start with the oldest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3903)|

| 1:05:06| and buy about 1,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| These are not Chromebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| These are laptops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| either Windows or Mac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| depending on the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| And then also in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| we would want to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| protective cases and software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| to address off-network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| content filtering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| to keep students away from harmful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| and inappropriate content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| when they're at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| We are also proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| a sustainable repair budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| that would be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| through a parent insurance option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| $30 would be the insurance option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| for parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| which would cover any damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| that occurred to the device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| And this would be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| in a self-insurance fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| that would pay for parts and repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| And I can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| because we have experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| with these devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| the least expensive repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| on these Chromebooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| will be right at $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| So anything over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| would be covered additionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| within that insurance option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| If a parent chooses not to opt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| into the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| then they would be billed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| per occurrence for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| that was damaged on the device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| It's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| that Chromebooks allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| for sort of what we call hot swapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3984)|
| 1:06:24| if a person at a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| is designated with a set of Chromebooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| that are sort of the spares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| if a student comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| with a device that's not working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| it's just a matter of minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| for them to swap out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| with a working device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| And then our technicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| come and pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3999)|
| 1:06:39| that inoperable device and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| That's because there's not data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| stored on the device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| It's actually in cloud storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| So that allows us to swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| the device out very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| and not have the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| going to class or home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| without the device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| whichever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| We are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| like Mr. Thomas mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| about internet at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| for staff and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| We are currently working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| with community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| and I know Dr. Roswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| will talk a little bit more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| to establish where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| with that respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| and to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| what our community can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| to help us with families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| who either can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| or really can't access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| broadband internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| in their area where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| We know that additional concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| have been voiced around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| specific hardware needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| for some particular programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| and for individual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| And as we do currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| we will address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| with either under the umbrella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| of the CTE program or special ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| or whatever department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| is pertinent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| So I don't want you to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| this is simply a one size fits all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| although we are attempting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| to be equitable with this purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| it's not the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| that we will ignore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| the specific needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| of students and programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| So our timeline is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| if the board approves next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| we will be able to place the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| We would expect to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| the devices that will be asset tagged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| and enrolled in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Knox County Schools Enterprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| by the first week in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| So they would be ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| to hand out to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| At that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| we would determine where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| with respect to opening schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| and determine how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| they're going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| And with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| if you have questions for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| or I'll turn it over to Dr. Ryswyk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| Let's go ahead and turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| to Dr. Ryswyk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| if you'll hold your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| and then we'll come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| Gail after Dr. Ryswyk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| And I'll have a hold back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| to what Gail said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| She did a really good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| of kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| painting a picture of the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| of what we're hoping to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| You know, I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| I hate the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| I think we all do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| that we're being able to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| But I think there are a lot of possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| as well as what we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| you know, going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| depending on what happens in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| I think it really helps our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| kind of get up to par| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| for what our students need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| what we know when they get into college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| and post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| a lot of that is online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| the world they navigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| I was looking at Noah right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| knowing his world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| has pretty much been that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| and will continue to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| those kinds of things moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| And we've always felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| that that was what we kind of owed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| our students was that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| I want to echo what Mr. Thomas said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| In no way have we ever thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| that it's meant to be a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| It's really meant to be a tool for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| And we're excited about that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| because we have a lot of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| I think this is the thing too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| in the conversation I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| with Teresa Nixon the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| you know, this is work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| that we have been doing for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| I mean, she reminded me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Ellen and STEM was our first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| one-to-one school launch eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| And we know how successful that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| has been for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| But we know especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| you know, they have been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| technologically savvy in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| We've had lots of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| We've been successful in launching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| a large high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| like Bearden High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| a large middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| like West Valley Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| into kind of a one-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| And, you know, we've seen some of the effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| and some of the positive things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| that can come for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| So, you know, this isn't a brand new idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| It's something that we have wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| And we've built some expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| with Gail's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| And then also with Teresa's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| we've become much more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| at training teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| and building it and out things like Canvas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| having that as our learning management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Aspen has had a lot of new things with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| You know, we've looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| some Google platform things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| Microsoft Teams as part of the package we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| So there's a lot of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| that our teachers have been familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| And we're also, you know, eyes wide open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| understand there's a lot of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| who haven't done some of those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| So I would just say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| ideally in an ideal situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| this is probably a one to two year rollout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| even though we have built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| a lot of expertise on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Unfortunately, our current situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| that we're facing as a nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| doesn't allow us one to two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| to roll this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| So we'll roll it out as best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| with what we've learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| and what we've learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| from other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| and what we've learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| from the expertise within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| We have plenty of principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| and teachers and staffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| that have been doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| and doing this successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| for quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| But we also understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| there'll be glitches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| and there'll be some snafus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| when you're rolling that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| But for us, we think the good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| definitely outweighs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| the challenges that we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| And we really think it'll help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| get our kids ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| for life after they leave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| So with that, I'll just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| we say this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| we have a lot of our support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| folks that are on as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| who can probably answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| specific questions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| And I'll just pass that on to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| if there are questions that come to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| You know, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| before we go to questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| can you answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| you may be able to answer too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| that I know that people will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| that I've just kind of jotted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Gail mentioned the internet situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| for students who don't have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| at their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| And also if you'll touch on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| or maybe Shannon wants to touch on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| teacher training over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Sure, I'll take our first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| You know, there are two parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| as Gail said to this equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| The first is having the device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| for students to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| And then we think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| hopefully this has taken care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| And then the other is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| internet accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| So two things that are very promising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| what we realize is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| internet accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| is not just a Knox County schools issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| It's the greater Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| and Knoxville issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| And so I think we've been encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| the chamber under Mike Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| And I think Amy Nolan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| has taken the lead kind of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| for them in the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| have put together working task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| that we have representation on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| really trying to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Because I think they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| that it's not just a Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| school benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| but Pellissippi could benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| from more internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| You know, UT Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| could benefit from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| as well as just economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| And as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| if we were a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| that really offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4399)|
| 1:13:19| some more broadband options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| you know, we need help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Obviously they can't just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| a schools initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| but we're happy to be at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| on with the chamber in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| And then we were encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| the superintendent and Keith and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| were invited to be part of a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| that the mayors have put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| as well looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| just how can the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| not specific to the internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| but what can the community do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| to come around schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| And this included President Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| and President Wise from Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| and from UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| as well as Bill Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| I think was the one who was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| to chair that by both mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| So very, we had kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4440)|
| 1:14:00| wanting to talk through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| but it came up time and time again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| that this internet accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| and it's not just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| we think about sometimes socioeconomics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| in certain parts of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| but also there are more rural parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| that don't have that kind of coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| And we have a few principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| on that committee as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| who brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| So I don't know that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| an immediate answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Kind of what our band-aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| can be in the meantime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| are kind of hot spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| but realistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| that's probably not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| You know, they're hard to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| They're easy to get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| You know, they can be costly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| So we probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| we have that ability to patch in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| some of those kinds of situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| but we really think the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| may be a broader community solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| in the long run for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| And as far as teacher training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Shannon, I'll let you address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| when you guys are put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Okay. Yeah, I'll give an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| and then I'm going to let Teresa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| talk more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| As John said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| this is work that we've been engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| in for about the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| And I would say over the last four or five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| we've been very intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| about all of the initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| that we've been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| gathering teachers together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| who are building success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| and expertise in some areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| pulling them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| through demonstration classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| leadership councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| various opportunities for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| to come and inform us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| on what's working well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| and then using our systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| to be able to collect what's working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| and share with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| So as we started to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| this situation evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| we already had a group of users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| at the elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| middle and high school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| both teachers and principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| who have a lot of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| And I asked Teresa to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| and start coordinating with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| to think about what are some lessons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| what are some experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| that we can pull together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| and share with our colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| across the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| and think about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| not so much as training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| but as learning together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| how to best support our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| And as John said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| our message in this is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| the teacher is the critical component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| in delivering education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| The device is a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| that we can use to stay connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| when we have to be remote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| and far away from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| But there are also some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| that we're learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| that we need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4581)|
| 1:16:21| we take back with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| when we're in in-person situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| And so how do we capitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| on all of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| And so we've been thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| through the model of starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| with what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| those learning outcomes to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| the ideal practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| that go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| And then what does that look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| in successive approximations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| of the ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| depending on whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| we're allowed to be face to face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| we're in a blended situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| or we're fully remote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| So that's kind of the umbrella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| of what we've been thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| And Teresa has really been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| the legwork of pulling together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| in a heroic amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| Lots of groups to give feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| and to inform the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| that we have developed at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| So I'll toss it to Teresa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| So thank you, Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| and the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| It's been really my great pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| I've been in this role now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| And as both John and Shannon have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| this has been part of the journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| We have really informed our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| based on listening to our stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| and really partners in the journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| I would really say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| just even thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| starting with LNN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| and to the number of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| that have embedded technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| or fully are one-to-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| But basically we will begin this Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| by sharing with teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| two different types of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| One is a social emotional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| that will come out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Janice Cook School Culture Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| because we realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| that a lot of the work is foundational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| to be able to enter into learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| and we need to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| of our emotional side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| the social emotional piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| And then also will be just some canvas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| kind of one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| But it will also be for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| in schools who may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| already been one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| and using our learning management system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| being able to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| as not only as a student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| but also to learn about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| some of the features as a leader as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| because canvas has been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| They continue to create new features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Every month we get new features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| that are added in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| and so updating folks on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| And then the basic overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| of the plan will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| we will cast our vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| We will then in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| begin with school level plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| for what we're calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| and labeling re-imagine learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| And it's intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| because we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| that re-imagine is a verb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| and it's continual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| For example, the example I used earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| was the way we taught reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| maybe 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| might look really different now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| because we've learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| more about brain research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| And so we just continue to re-imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| what our classrooms look and sound like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| And so with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| the overview of the re-imagine learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| will have a casting our vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| which will be grounded and anchored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| in our district strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| which we think is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| to anchor in the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| and our content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Then it will be foundational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| for people to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| how classroom culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| as well as our concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| around thinking about student ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| are foundational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| before we even begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| talking about what the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| might look and sound like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| Then kind of the next group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| is thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| the digital learning spectrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| and how students might engage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| as Shannon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| in either fully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| we're at normal schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| and we're face to face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| and blending in some of the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| within the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| But when situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| are less than ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| really thinking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| what might the other options be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| We are going to highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| some of the digital learning tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| and some best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| and lessons learned there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| And then really diving in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| on some content specific thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| I know that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| had some great learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| when we implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| some of our early adopters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| for one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| There might've been some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| in which we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| that a device was used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| maybe in lieu of instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| or rather than complimenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| and as a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| And that is really what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| as we develop the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| which I had 58 administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| coaches, central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| and teachers basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| who helped feed into this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| plus the previous seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| of me being in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| And then really developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| this course right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| that will go live in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| We have 70 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| who are serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| in different modular teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| all bringing varied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| stakeholder positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| Prior to it going live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| we will be offering for any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| for a variety of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| to be able to preview the content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| and offer us feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| before we push that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| So I really believe it's a collective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| plan from across the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| and all of our lessons learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| while also being informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| by national research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| Great, thank you so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| for all of those overviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| Hopefully that will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| get our discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| off to a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| Do we have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| Who'd like to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Sure. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| first a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| I would just say a couple of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| in my district are already one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| and I do know they just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| felt the frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| because as a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| we are not that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| but they felt handicapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| in this sort of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| that they could not continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| with learning in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4922)|
| 1:22:02| that they thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| they were set up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| because we as a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| are not set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4926)|
| 1:22:06| So I do really support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| trying to get all of our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| on the same level of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| My big question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| I'm not really sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| who to address this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| is more the financial side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| and really the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| that was given to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| that we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| So who would be the best person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Is Ron or I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| who the best person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| on the money side is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| I kind of just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| understand it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| and I mean, I'm not a finance person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| so I'll just do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| but we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| a three-year lease payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| of five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| So I didn't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| if the five million is an upfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| or if that's five million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| every year for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| and then the devices last for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| That's one of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| and then the secondary question on money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| is with the CARES Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| we're seeing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4976)|
| 1:22:56| there's about $12 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| that should come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| And I saw something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| that maybe a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| might have to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4982)|
| 1:23:02| to charter schools, other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| but then that still would leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| a few million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| And so I'm kind of questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| what are we looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| because I know there's certain parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| with the CARES Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| and I'm getting a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| from my community about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| So this is a lot of why I'm addressing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| So I know I've wrapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| a lot of questions into that, Ron,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| but maybe you're the one to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Go ahead, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| I'll sure give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| A lot of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| Ms. Babb, you're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| we're asking the same questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5011)|
| 1:23:31| And apparently the state's asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| the same questions from the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| So the annual investment cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| is $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| That includes about $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| or a little bit more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| maybe for the lease costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| plus the supports that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| Yeah, and the plan would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| you know, with the board's blessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| the plan would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| that we would utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| the CARES Act money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| That is easily shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| to be an allowable use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| based on the guidance we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| So the CARES Act money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| is about $12.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| You're right, we estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| maybe a million dollars of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| will go out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| We're still trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| an exact figure on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| but there is a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| to pass those dollars on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| to private schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| and the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| like we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| with Title I monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| or other federal monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| like IDEA and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| So yeah, we're probably looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| at about $11.8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| to go along with that assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| So $7 million off of that amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| would leave us with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| about $4.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| There's a couple of options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| We could park that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| and partially fund year two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| We could take that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| and potentially try to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| part of the budget gap with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| That's what we're trying to get guidance on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| if we decided to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| I think it's important to note too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| that though this is one-time money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| pretty much anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5108)|
| 1:25:08| we would do with this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| would be recurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| whether it's devices or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| because our needs are recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| We've reached out to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| and said based on the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| we have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| it would appear that if we chose to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| we could utilize these dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| to help fund the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| We've said it in a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| but ultimately it's to save positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| So the response I got back from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| was somewhat noncommittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| It was we're trying to get more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| from the feds and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| I was given another name from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| I reached out to that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| and I've yet to receive a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| So we're going to keep pressing on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| for an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| They did indicate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| they plan to come out with an FAQ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| because I suspect they're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| a lot of these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| from other districts too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| They suggested that FAQ would come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| within a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| So a lot of this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| I hate to say guesswork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| but that's kind of what we're operating on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| absent of very detailed guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| I can tell you my best guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| and I could be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| but my best guess is ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| we would be allowed to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| some of these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| to help close the budget gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| I think we just have to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| and not deem it as replacing revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| It would have to be more along the lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| of saving positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| We did the same thing with the ARRA money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| back about 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| a lot of this is speculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| until we can get more detailed information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| Okay, can I ask one more question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| back about the $7 million for the devices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| I guess a little bit of my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| it looks like it's a three year payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| and we're talking about these devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| should last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| So should there be a fourth and fifth year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| where we wouldn't have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| paying the lease on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Presumably the answer to that would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| So, you know, we could come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| we don't, I mean, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5238)|
| 1:27:18| that's three years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| But so, yes, that's the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| You know, we could say, well, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| that's a budget savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| for the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Problem is, is once you use that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| now you're looking at another addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| back to the budget again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| trying to find that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| There's a couple of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| We could take it as a budgetary savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| but just we would know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| hey, we don't have a funding stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| dedicated for that in future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| We wouldn't be trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| climb that mountain again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| The other option would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| that we would kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| smooth those payments out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Maybe we don't make a $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| In other words, we would set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| a technology reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| to where we could kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| get a running start in future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| So you may want to set aside $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| in year or $3 million or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| in year one, another $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| in year two, which will be four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Then you have some money available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| going into the next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| So essentially you're adopting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| a sustainability or a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| sustainability plan for future devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| So it wouldn't be $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| So it's ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| it could be $4 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| But by that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| you have the money in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| So ultimately, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| I think there's a budgetary savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| It's just a question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| how would we want to capture it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| Okay, no, that helped me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I just, I kind of kept getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| a little bit confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| just about the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| and how they were laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| So thank you for explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| Okay, we have other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5327)|
| 1:28:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| Susan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Oh, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Can you, or Gail Bower, address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| I know we all got that email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| from Daniel Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| regarding the visually impaired students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| Could Gail kind of address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| as to, or John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| how many visually impaired students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| And I know that the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| we received said that Chromebooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| would not be a good device for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| So are there plans to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| for some of the special needs areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| or the visually impaired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| Whoever can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| Yeah, Gail, if that would be you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| or whoever wants to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| But Jason, do you want to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| But also if you'll just kind of expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| on, you know, other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| we have a lot of kids with IEPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| So would there be a variety of devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| for that, for those needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| Sure. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Yeah, you know, that email prompted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| obviously, some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| that I had already been having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| within my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Summer Tucker supervises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| our vision programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| and a number of other programs for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| So we're already in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| of not just determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| what children may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| different devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| but what those devices might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| We're also in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| applying for grant dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| through the State Department of Ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| that we will hopefully use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| to purchase additional devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| that really are going to be geared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| toward that accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| Ms. Bounds, I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| a specific number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| in terms of the number of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| who are visually impaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| in the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| But what I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| is that we do have a full department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| And we do provide robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| programming for those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| The spirit of an IEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| is obviously to be individualized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| And just like our practice would be now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| if an IEP team determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| that a particular device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| would not be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| and we should look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| in a different direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| for that specific child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| then we would get that device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| for that child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| And so that's our approach now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| That'll be our approach moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| But we are in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| of doing some front end work on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| so that my folks can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| with Gail and her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| and sort of preempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| some of those needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| as we're walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| through this process together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Susan, I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Here, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| I know that we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| several emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| The whole board has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| one from Dr. Roundtree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| one from Natasha Page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| about the K-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| use of the Chromebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| And I understand from Ms. Baird| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| that they're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| at a more expensive device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| for K-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| So if she could just speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| a little bit to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| because I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| as a former kindergarten teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| it really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| And I was glad to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| that they were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| at some other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| not that we don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5558)|
| 1:32:38| to be teaching keyboarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| but some of that's developmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| and their fingers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| just aren't capable of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| So I guess that would be a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| for Ms. Baird to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5571)|
| 1:32:51| about what they're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| for K-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| I'll be happy to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| the device issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| What we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| is what's referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| as a two-in-one device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| So it is a Chromebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| but if you can imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| the back flipping over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| and becoming a tablet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| I'm sure all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| have seen children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| who are able to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| with phones and iPads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| and the touchscreen technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| So we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| As far as the pedagogy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| I'm going to pass this ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| to Dr. Eiswig and his crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| I'll jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5612)|
| 1:33:32| Thanks, Gail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| I'll jump in for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| and I may specifics to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Ms. Bounds, have Shannon speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| I think this would be a good time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| hearing Jason's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| I know Keeson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| there may be questions for CTE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| that come up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| I just want to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| let us think for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| that the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| will have more options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| with this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| But what we don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| is the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| drastically changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| I think there's kind of visions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| of what it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| and some teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| will take it to the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| and some won't be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5647)|
| 1:34:07| And we're fine with both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| We've seen that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| if you go down in STEM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| or school that is kind of that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| you'll see kind of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| at different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| So we don't see kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| through second grade classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| We still see rugs with squares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| We still see big books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| being read to kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| and kids reading those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| back to teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5666)|
| 1:34:26| and questions being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| in small group rotations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| I mean, all those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| I think will look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| but what could look different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| is when kids are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| in small groups rotating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| there might be a technology station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| where they're doing these touch pads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| and doing that kind of thing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| So I just want to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| same thing with special ed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| nothing's changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5683)|
| 1:34:43| with those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| We're still going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| CTE, Keith and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| have talked about it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| These won't be replacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| what we already do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| for those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| if extra equipment's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| I think if we think of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| kind of like as a pencil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| they take from class to class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| they'll have this Chromebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| or this other touch pad device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| they can take from class to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| But all of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| that are specific to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| or within the teacher's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| current wheelhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| will be asking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| So sorry, I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| And Shannon, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| if you maybe speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Sure. K-2 is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| our biggest area of concern too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| as we started thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| those appropriate uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| We do want our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| We've talked about this a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| with our groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5726)|
| 1:35:26| that are developing the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| We want young students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| who are learning to write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| to do that on paper and pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| And so when we're doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| we are able to have that instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| and the teacher can lean in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| and see that and model it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| and give that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| They can stand and do the motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| with their hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| and all the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| our care program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| and our writing program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| has embedded in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| But when they are separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| and we're in an extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| period of closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| the device will also allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| the teacher to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| with the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| to continue to lead them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| through some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| And they may tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| it's time to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| your paper and your pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| And so the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| will be doing that work on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| but the teacher will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| to direct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| That's in, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| the most remote situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| and one that is not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| We really want the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| in the classroom together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| So we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| some different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| We do know that students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| will have to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5789)|
| 1:36:29| how the devices work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| in order to be able to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| So there will be some training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| that happens in those young classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| but that won't be the focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| of the youngest classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| We're also looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5800)|
| 1:36:40| at some efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| So we know that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5803)|
| 1:36:43| for our young students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| to be able to read out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| If they all have a device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| then one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| there are some possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| that we can be thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| And I'll tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| the most amazing thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| about getting teachers together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| is they come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| all kinds of creative ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| And, you know, one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| is that students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| who maybe don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| anybody to read to at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| are able to read to their device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| and the teacher can then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| hear their recording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| and hear those students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| reading in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| So we're trying to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| not just replacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| what we do with instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| with a device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5833)|
| 1:37:13| but thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| how the device can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| you know, we really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5836)|
| 1:37:16| three things we think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| Does it make us more efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Does it increase engagement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| And does it deepen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| critical thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| And so if the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| to that is yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| then we have some strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| that we may want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| and build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5849)|
| 1:37:29| But sometimes also the best tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| and we're making this clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| in our training too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| is a piece of paper and a pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| So we don't want anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| to think we're throwing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| all the good strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| that we know are effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| We're looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| as a layer of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| that can help our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| and our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5867)|
| 1:37:47| remain connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| in those disconnected times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Thank you, Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| I appreciate you and Dr. Ross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| with both addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| And I think that will reassure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| a lot of the early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| primary grade teachers out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| that already have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| about how rigorous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| and robust our learning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| and how it's been fished down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| from the upper grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| to the lower grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| and sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| developmentally inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| So, and there are good uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| and the one you shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| is very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| That would be a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| way to utilize that device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| So I appreciate you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| thinking through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| and thank you both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| for answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| Another question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| that I think we read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| that if one of you would touch on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| was a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| whether students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| would actually carry the device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| particularly elementary students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| Would they be carrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5920)|
| 1:38:40| devices home every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Would somebody like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5923)|
| 1:38:43| to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| I'd be happy to take it, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| I'll take a shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| And if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| So I just realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| my camera's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| It might be an advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| No, I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| our goal is we understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| you know, that our system is diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| It's got lots of different principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| lots of different communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| And I think what we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| what we're not interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| is forcing any of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| kinds of things down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| into your question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| you know, how often does it go home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| What goes home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| Those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| I think one thing we learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| in Teresa was a big part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| years ago when we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| the one to one initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| is was kind of one size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| doesn't fit all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| So communities are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| I can remember when Corrington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| went one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| I can remember it was very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| than West Valley Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| going one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5976)|
| 1:39:36| So we're hopeful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| that we can do this in a pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5981)|
| 1:39:41| for those communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| for what those principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| are comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| and what those teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| are comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| Of course, the game changer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| as the superintendent alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| we don't know what the fall holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| We hope that it's not a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| where we have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| into a quicker deployment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| because school could be suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| or delayed or those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| And that would change everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| We would have to kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| you know, make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| we got the devices out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| and we're going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| But we don't have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| no kindergartners take them home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| or all kindergartners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| have to take them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6014)|
| 1:40:14| I think we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| to leave that up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| the schools to make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| And I know Julie's on the call, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| She may have an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| But I think what we've learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| is best left to what the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| can work out to do that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| But I would defer to Julie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| OK, thank you, Julie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| Would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6032)|
| 1:40:42| OK, we may not have her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| OK, do we have other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| I would like to commend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| the staff for answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| I think I know I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| I had sent a list of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| and I'm sure a lot of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| board members had also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| I think you've you've addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| many of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| I'm sure that we've missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| but we've addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| you've addressed many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| So thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| thorough explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| And for the legwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| that you've put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| over the past several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| on getting this presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| And so if if there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| Yeah, yes, Miss Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| So I just there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| that is still running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| through my mind right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| And while I 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| support the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| going one to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| I think that that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| something that's past due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| that we should have been one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| And so I'm excited that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| that is now the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| that we're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| But I just want to put out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| just some information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| not to say that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| necessarily going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| what we're voting on or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| but just making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| that it's clarity out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| I know we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| throwing around LNN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| and how they've been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| really becoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| their number nine in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| So happy and excited about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| and the program that they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| and the education that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| But I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| that we're clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| they also have a device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| that allows them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| certain programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| that the Chromebooks will not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| And so I don't want the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| or our board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| to have this misconception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| that we get these devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| then we're all going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| like an LNN school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| because the resources have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| they have MacBook Airs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| and they have programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| that allows them to do those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| such as coding and take education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| And so I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| that we're clear on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| and have an understanding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| And also the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6164)|
| 1:42:44| has an understanding of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| yes, we might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| Yes, we're going to put in resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| and buy these Chromebooks for one-to-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| but there's still a level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| of what you can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| do on these devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| And so that I just want to throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| that out there and just make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| But I also just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| I mean, you all said yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| that we have 40,000 devices already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| We're already one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| with 40,000 devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| And that has been supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| through fundraising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| through donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| and also through Title I funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| And so I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| that it's one of those approaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| that it needs to be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| through the district level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| But I'm curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| I raised the question of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| is it wise to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| this large amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| that we are essentially being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| I mean, even Commissioner Swann| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| herself said, be mindful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| of how you spend this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| because it could just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| significantly worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| in the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| And for these devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| to have to be replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| every three years possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| or every five years possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| and we can really predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| that the next two or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| are going to be even worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| than where we're at right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| when it comes to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I'm just hesitant on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| is it a wise purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| of 60,000 so many right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| And I understand that we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| what August looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| and we might have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| completely distant learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| And there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| a lot of unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| because we're waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| on the county and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| to make broadband a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| in Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| I even think about where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| I only have one internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| And I have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| 70 plus dollars for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| And there's no other servers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| There's other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| that do not have servers at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| So we're committing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| to a $7 million purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| all of these barriers and unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| And so that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| where I stand with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| And I support our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| going one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| I just feel like we have to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| it just feels really irresponsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| to spend this CARE Act money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Example, real life examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| helped me a lot to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| I got my $1,200 stimulus check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| and I really wanted to buy Apple Watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| but I know that I probably should use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| that money for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| And so I'm just really cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| of spending that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| when we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| we don't know what the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| and upcoming years will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| So if there's a different solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| I don't have a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| That's why I'm saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| it's not really gonna impact my vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| if we go to one to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| but I really push for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| figuring out how we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| figure out another solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| without having to take that chunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| of such a much needed money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| that we're possibly gonna need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| like next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| So that's just my thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| on the whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| Ms. Fabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| And this will just be quick on comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| and some of it addresses Evity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| I mean, I do think that we have gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| kind of some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| that can be used for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| And so maybe it'll enable us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| to do something in a crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| to enable us to be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| for this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| But I've been contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| by a lot of community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| businesses that have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| if we were asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| we would help fund this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| because I think our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| as a whole has realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| our public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| could not continue education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| the way we all expected education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| to happen because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| the lack of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| And so I think after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| I mean, I kind of look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| as maybe we could use the 7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| in the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| but can we look at not each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| doing coupon sales and bake sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| to get their devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| but can we look at some community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| initiatives to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| the community as a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| And the second comment I want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| is I look at me and Susan and Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| all have college age kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| And I think some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| just think this was seamless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| for people who had technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| as someone with three college kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| who continued education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200506?start=6415)|
