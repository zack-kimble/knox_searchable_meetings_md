| 0:00:00| Commissioner McKenzie, would you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| I'll stand. Face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=5)|
| 0:00:10| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=10)|
| 0:00:17| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=17)|
| 0:00:22| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=22)|
| 0:00:30| As we try to get our meeting under our belt here for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=30)|
| 0:00:49| there's maybe not many things for us to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| but we've got several things that come along in the form of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=52)|
| 0:00:58| I think I heard just a moment ago someone say ten weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=58)|
| 0:01:05| Someone said ten weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| That reminds me that next week, in front of our regular stated monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=69)|
| 0:01:17| we will be having a reception for Jill at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| 430 next Monday in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| Also, there's been some discussion about swear-in and reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| Now, this right now is just in the announcement phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| Swearing-in is going to occur on September 1st. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| Do we need to add something to today's agenda to discuss the reorganization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=105)|
| 0:01:53| Well, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| And, of course, everything is pending the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| so I'd like to consider a few dates if other people are in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| because I will not be on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| So I'd like to have a discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| Okay. We will add that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Mr. Law Director, you will be ready to advise us during that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| So a discussion item being added to today's agenda will be about not swearing-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| That will occur on September 1st, but reorganization of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| A third item that I need to recognize, just, I mean, this is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| The Government Finance Officers Association, and let me read a paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=151)|
| 0:02:42| This is from the Government Finance Officers Association to Knox County's Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| We are pleased to notify you that your comprehensive annual financial report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| sometimes we say CAFR, for the physical year ending June the 30th, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| qualifies for a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Finance Reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| This Certificate of Achievement is the highest form of recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| in governmental accounting and financial reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| and its attainment represents a significant accomplishment by a government and its management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=199)|
| 0:03:29| Not only is this letter for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| this is the 20th consecutive year that Knox County has received that certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=212)|
| 0:03:41| I also want to continue for just another second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| The National Association of Medical Examiners has fully accredited the Knox County Regional Forensic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=224)|
| 0:03:56| Now, while we are just at the moment in announcements, that's a significant event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| I believe they checked 400 things, and I believe Knox County was compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| The Knox County Regional Forensic Center was compliant in all 400 of their test questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=247)|
| 0:04:16| I would like you, my fellow commissioners, to say it's okay for the Chair to enter into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=256)|
| 0:04:26| after the election and after the swearing in and after the reorganization of Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=266)|
| 0:04:35| that the Senior Director of the Knox County Regional Forensic Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| and the Chair of Commission establish a date for commission to be exposed to, not in a forensic way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=282)|
| 0:04:53| but in an educational way about the Forensic Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| and that would be some afternoon late in September, early October, late in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=298)|
| 0:05:07| for the Knox County Commission to receive a tour of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| If there be no objection to that, I will say something to the Senior Director, John Lott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| about establishing the date and getting a process in place that he could have a program for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=321)|
| 0:05:32| Seeing no objection, I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| Also, another announcement, the Audit Committee met this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| A full-fledged, pedal-to-the-metal examination of last year's books will begin after Labor Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| and in a letter from Pew and Company, Mr. Elmore said that audits are a two-way street of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=353)|
| 0:06:06| and that he has always received good participation from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| and two-way information flows not only of him asking questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| but of Knox County participating, and the buzzwords that he used in auditing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| if you know something, say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| The next meeting of the Knox County Audit Committee will be September the 19th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=390)|
| 0:06:39| One last thing here in announcements, the Fraud and Compliance Hotline received two reports last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=399)|
| 0:06:53| Both have been closed, and there are no outstanding Fraud or Compliance Hotline reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=413)|
| 0:07:04| There are no open reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| Those are my announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Anyone else have anything they'd like to say before we get into the establishment of the agenda for today's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=429)|
| 0:07:21| I see that we have nothing to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Is there anything to be deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| Is there anything to be removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| I would offer that the two items that we need to discuss this evening are items number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=452)|
| 0:07:42| It has blanks in it, names of people to serve as directors of the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=462)|
| 0:07:52| and item 29, which has to do with fuel cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| I see there is a hard copy of that before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| That's item 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| It's on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Are there other items that should be pulled that we will discuss this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Yes, and I can't find it on this new sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| The one on Anderson School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=500)|

| 0:08:53| Item 43 is Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| Is Mike Hammond here for his discussion item today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| I think he said that he was going to wait and come to the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| His discussion item will be on the main meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| He has to ring us a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| Rural Metro, item 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Is that today or the main meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Item 44 will be on the main meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| Charlie Bussler, you had a discussion of your item was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| I'm not going to be here in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Mr. Chairman, I was not going to be here in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| and I just wanted to have a time to speak to the commission next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Item 45, Commissioner Bussler will be at the main meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| So the only discussion item we'll have is the one that we will have on reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| Is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Are there any other changes in the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| Seeing no further discussion, do I hear a motion that the agenda is set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Motion is properly before us and seconded that the agenda be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=615)|
| 0:10:25| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Motion properly before us to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Madam Clerk, Item 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| It's listed on page 2, Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| It's approving the appointments or reappointments of four individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| to serve as directors of the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| and the Health, Educational, and Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| Since this item, Number 5, has blanks in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| I would make a motion that it be forwarded, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| We're going to have Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| Mr. Todd Napier, do you have the names in your discussion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| My name is Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| I'm here on behalf of the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| and the Knox Health, Educational, and Housing Facility Boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| We sponsored this item on the agenda, and we always send it over in blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=704)|
| 0:11:52| And the reason for that is ultimately the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| and Health, Educational, and Housing Facility Boards are your boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| and those are your nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And we've always tried to provide you with folks that we felt like were very qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| but I would also say that we've had members on those boards that have come from nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| from individual county commissioners that have done an outstanding job as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| So I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| But we have put together a nominating committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| and we start with a list and start contacting individuals about their interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| and willingness to serve on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| It's a pretty big commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| It's once a month for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| So sometimes there's really good folks that just can't commit to that at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| and make that kind of a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| And so I just want to announce that just because someone says they can't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| doesn't mean that there's not significant reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| But what we have put before you is five names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Our goal was to have sent six, but we just had several of those that just ultimately had to decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| In your board package, we have put together brief bios on each of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| in most cases provided by the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| We have two board members, Greg McWhorter and Doug White, who have finished up their terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=785)|
| 0:13:13| And I would say both of those gentlemen actually were serving out the remainder of unfulfilled terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| So I don't think either one of them have actually been on there for the full six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| who have said that they would be willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| Dwayne Setzer and Greg Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| Greg finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Neither one wanted to serve another term, and they did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| So in addition to those two gentlemen, we've got Ms. Julie Willard, Mr. Rick Gentry, and Dr. Anthony Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=816)|
| 0:13:46| He's the director of Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| I had hoped to have sent them out a notice about this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| I thought I'd done that a week earlier, but inadvertently found out toward the end of last week I hadn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| So I did send out a notice about this meeting as well as the full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| But Ms. Jeweler and Mr. Gentry both were able to make it this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| I want to acknowledge both of them right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| And if possible, if you had any questions or would like them to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| this might be a good opportunity just in the fact that they might not be able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| I would like a confirmation that Anthony Wise will be able to make it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| I think Mr. McWhorter will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| And I'm yet to hear from Mr. White about his availability next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| But I'd be happy to answer any questions about kind of what the duties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| I think tonight's presentation at the Finance Committee, the timing was pretty good on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| The Industrial Development Board for the County of Knox serves a very critical part in any pilots that are initiated through county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=879)|
| 0:14:51| as well as there's two TIFs, actually, that are in place that the County Industrial Development Board has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| So, you know, they're a very important body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| And also any state grants that kind of come in, they'll come through the Industrial Development Board as the state's conduit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| So it's an important body, and they have committees that do a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| So at that, I'll just quit talking and just, again, want to acknowledge that Mrs. Willard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| and Mr. Gentry are here with us tonight in addition to the resumes that they've been provided to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| Mrs. Willard, Mr. Gentry, would either of you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=929)|
| 0:15:44| Good afternoon. Rick Gentry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| I think I'm a great candidate for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| I have over 21 years of experience in commercial real estate in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| I've built four multifamily complexes that have a total value in excess of $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| and that includes Lake Plaza, the 10-story building behind the Cumberland Avenue McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| I've brokered over $125 million worth of apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| I was named CCIM Broker of the Year in 2014 and CCM Broker of the Year for Multifamily in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=972)|
| 0:16:23| I've also been involved in a couple of projects that have obtained pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| That's the Evolve Apartments on Cumberland Avenue and the Four Points by Sheraton on 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=987)|
| 0:16:36| On a side note, I'd like to say this commission approved my Snyder Road apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| and I'm happy to report that I believe we've got the entrance worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| and it's on Outlet Drive as the zoning condition that you all put out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| and that's where I wanted it anyway, so I'm very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| I'll be in Nashville meeting with the Tennessee Housing Development Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| I'm working on tax-exempt bond financing on senior independent living complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1030)|
| 0:17:22| To end this, I think there are three reasons I'd be of value to the IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| One is my diversity of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Second, I will win new perspective to complement the talented individuals currently on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| And lastly and most importantly, I've been in Knoxville for 25 years, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| and it's been a great place to live and work, and I want to give back to this great community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you, Mr. Gentry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Ms. Willard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| My name is Julie Wheeler, and I'm a CPA in public practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| I've been working for Culture and Justice and Ernst & Young in Knoxville for 23 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| and have been served as an auditor in that capacity for those years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| so I'm very familiar with the process of looking at financial statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| and looking at financial data to make sure that everything looks as it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| I have even participated with two of my clients on their revenue bond financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| so I'm familiar with what that process looks like as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| I appreciate the commission's consideration of me, and I appreciate the development board nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you, Ms. Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| I guess it's just a question or maybe a request of Todd is that you don't have to get up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| I think it would be a good thing to have these two board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| although they hadn't served the six-year term, if you could maybe e-mail their attendance record for that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| I can do that, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Just provide that to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| Is that the best way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| To the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| To the commission office, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| With no further discussion of this, I do express the appreciation of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| for the two appointees that are here today to stand and represent themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1168)|
| 0:19:37| I also thank Mr. Napier for the nominations as being presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| and the additional information that he will provide at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| The motion that's before us is for forwarding to full commission, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Madam Clerk, the next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| Is it 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Yes, it's listed on page four, item number 14, resolution 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| It is approving the reinstitution of a lease agreement with the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee, CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| for use of the old Anderson Elementary School facility for the purpose of operating a Head Start preschool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| for the term of July 1st, 2016, through June 30th, 2035.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| My concern when I saw this is that I don't know what kind of condition that building is in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| and you've got a lot of remodeling to do before it can be used, don't you, Russ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| Sir, the CAC has been in that building for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| Their initial lease began in 1995,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| and the lease that we're proposing to reinstitute is virtually the same lease that they agreed to at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| and with that they picked up responsibility for the maintenance of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| So you're taking the space they're using rather than the other space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| They've got the facility, the whole facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| We're not taking anything from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| This just reinstitutes the lease that has been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| They had a provision in the original lease to reinstitute that lease for an additional 20 years at the end of the initial term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1290)|
| 0:21:40| and they neglected to inform us that they wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| So what this does is really re-ups that same lease on the same terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| So they're going to continue to use the space that they have been using?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| I know that part of that building is unusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| And I have not been in it, but like I said, the terms of the lease are that they maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Russ, I just want to clarify where this is at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Is this off western right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| It's at 4808 Prospect Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| It's in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| It's right next to South Door Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| Commissioner Brown, were you going to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| In that case, I'll make a motion to go ahead and include that with the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| The motion before us is to approve and it be a part of consent agenda for the main meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| I need to make a clarification now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Dr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Now, you will hear me say Thomas and Thomas and Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| I have a Dr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| I have a Vice Chairman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| And then there's plain old Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| And he works across the street also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you, Dr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| I wouldn't call him plain old Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| He's pretty big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Plain old Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| Madam Clerk, excuse me for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Let me back up one thing on this Anderson Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| The new hard copy of the resolution was passed out this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1428)|

| 0:24:20| You don't want to make a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Well, I think it's a continuation of an old contract, and they sell us fuel at pennies over the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| It's a good contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| You can do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| This is a continuation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1472)|

| 0:27:25| Madam Clerk, does that get us to our discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| That one's next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| All of the three discussion items that were on the agenda will be at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| The discussion item that's before us now is the reorganization of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1664)|
| 0:27:56| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Everything obviously goes off the election results, but if I'm still around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| I would like to ask if we could not do reorganization on September 1st because I'll be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| I'll be back the following Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| Sometime after that, that goes along with all of the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| If that would work, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Commissioner Smith first, then the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| I need to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| I was just wondering if there were any other commissioners that may not be available at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| I would not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| The following week, I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| The first, I won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| I'm mildly concerned as to what this would do to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Are you all asking Jeff and myself and Amy and Mike to extend our terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| It's a swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| It's the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Okay, I won't be here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| So it's the swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| The swearing in happens on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| This is reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| So you're going to be out of town for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| I will, but I can do that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| I'm talking about the reorder of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| Vice Chairman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| So just so we're clear, what days are you all going to be gone so we can make sure we're doing everybody's job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| Well, I'd prefer not to tell everybody in the world where my house is going to be empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Sometime after the middle of that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| I'll let you try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| I will be back on the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| So are we looking at the 7th, the 8th, the 9th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| He's not coming back until the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| I thought he said the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| He said the 2nd, which is a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| I'm looking at Wednesday, Thursday, Friday the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Okay, that's the 7th, 8th, and 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| It really depends on also the other people that get elected, their availability as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1817)|
| 0:30:26| Mr. Law Director, let me ask a question of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Could you describe what rules we may have in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| The only rule that applies to your reorganization meeting is that it is the first meeting on or after September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1836)|
| 0:30:46| So it's at the pleasure of this board, whenever you call a meeting on or after September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| whatever that is, you have to have a reorganization at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| Theoretically, it could be at the work session, but that's not really feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| It could be any meeting called on the 1st or after the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| Whatever that is, you have to do reorganization at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Very first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| The reason that I ask for what do we have in our rules is that by supermajority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| we can suspend our rules and select the date that we want to have reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| Anyway, is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Yes, but that's not in your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| That's the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| So the rules deals with the reorganization itself but not the setting of the reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| You cannot suspend the fact that when you call a meeting on or after September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| at that meeting, you have to reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| You can call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| It can be your workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| That would be the first meeting after the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| You can reorganize then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| If you had one on the 1st, you can reorganize then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Whatever that first meeting called after the 1st or on the 1st, you have to reorganize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1914)|
| 0:32:04| That's all the rule says or the code says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1924)|
| 0:32:18| September 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| We can set a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Should we wait until after the election to set the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| I would say that the folks who are running will know if we set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| We'll know August 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| I'm saying that all the people that are in contention, if you go ahead and set the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| they can go ahead and prepare themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| I would hate to wait until the 5th to set it for the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| August 5th for the September 8th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| Right, well, it gives them a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Hopefully they'd be excited about wanting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| We, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| I heard you say the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| So it's possible to do this in the August work session, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| No, September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| September work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| So that will be at the third week of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| But you'd have to have a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| It is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718?start=2004)|
