| 0:10:30| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| When I was reviewing our agenda for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| this one in particular jumped at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| because I guess part of my background working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| in child advocacy, seeing child abuse in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| firsthand, I wanted to ask Dr. Buchanan to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| a very kind of brief handful of bullet point updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| on child mortality in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| This is not necessarily related directly to child abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| but I know that this particular program is related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| to a federal program that passes down to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| then gets passed out to us to research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| on a local level infant mortality in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| And there's not a more important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| that we can do as a government and try to protect our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| So I thought this would be interesting when I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| to Dr. Buchanan this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=682)|
| 0:11:22| Thank you, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| director of the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| And I like the new podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| It's shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| So anyway, that's my editorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| I like the new podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Thank you for this opportunity to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| about a very important program for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| The Fetal Infant Mortality Review Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| is a nationwide program, as Commissioner Nystrom stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| where groups, teams around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| including Knox County, get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| and review the deaths of infants between 24 weeks gestation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| and one year of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| And in Knox County, that's about 25 to 35 deaths a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| And that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| And it's actually gone up some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| We'll be looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| We'll be keeping an eye on that and investigating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| what those different causes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Some of the things that come out of this type of program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| because they review the cases and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| give them to a community action team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| And that community action team is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| charged with making recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| to the state and the state to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| ABCs of sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| You've heard that before, those things about not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| sleeping with your baby, putting your baby on its back to sleep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| and they sleep in their own crib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| That came out of all of this data from across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| teaching us how to keep our children safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Some of the things they're focusing on here locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| of course, NAS, immunizations, prematurity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| All of those things contribute to premature death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| in a child as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| So it's really an important team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| It's really a challenge for some, as you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| to review the death of an infant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Some of the challenging things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| are going on related to the opiate problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| are we see an increase in infants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| who, unfortunately, suffocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Because an abundant adult rolls over on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| and they end up dying from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| And that's something we're really looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| And how do we improve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| How do we make that not such a problem in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| And any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Thank you, Dr. McKinnon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=806)|

| 0:13:56| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=836)|
| 0:13:56| Mr. Chairman, Doug answered my question beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| So unless he makes more, make a comment, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Do you want to repeat what your question was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Mr. Bussard wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Doug, I guess you may need to come down here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| My question was that the contractors that we were using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| and I found out that the contractor at my ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| had a terrible thing about tearing up fences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| running into fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| We built a brand new baseball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| Didn't cost the county taxpayers zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| It didn't last two or three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| and the lawn service ran into it and ripped a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| And Doug has come up with ways to prevent that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| Mr. Bussard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| On some of these contracts that you get in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| there's this information that's put on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| about all the kind of equipment that these individuals have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| How do you run your check to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| that they have all those pieces of equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| The equipment itself is pretty basic for lawn care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| zero turn radius mowers, string trimmers, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| The checks and balances that we've actually put in now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| is that each contractor has to take a picture of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| the day it's mowed and email it to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| That way, we can follow up with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| and make sure that they're doing their job appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| We're also putting at each park that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| has a contract mow the name of the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| and their phone number, so the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| knows who's mowing the grass at that particular park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| The only reason why I ask, I was looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| at some of those contracts or some of the bids that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| and they were talking about how many mowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| and how many pieces of equipment they had and stuff like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| And there was, I forgot which one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| it was that said that they had 20 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| and there was 40 pieces of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| And I didn't know how you would check that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| because the equipment is a big, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| part of the assessment of the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| And then some of them were bidding those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| And how do you know that they have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Do you get an inventory list from them showing what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| Or what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Well, Jay Garrison with Purchasing was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| because he ran that bid for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| He's still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=976)|
| 0:16:27| Jay Garrison, Noss County Procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| 1,000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| We ask that they provide an inventory list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| We also do reference checks to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| that they provide the services that they say they can provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| I was just wondering, a tangible property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| is what we go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| And every county has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| And you could run that to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| that they have that, that they've paid taxes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| And I didn't know if you just take their word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| or you just check it out yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| And that's the only question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| I'm not trying to get you or got you or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| And I wonder if you really do check those out and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| that they do have the equipment, which they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| since that's a big part of the value of the quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| We just go off the inventory list that they submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1034)|
| 0:17:14| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Did the contractor make repairs to the damaged fences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| Or did the county end up having to pay to have that redone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| I would have to check and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| I believe that was one of Commissioner Carson's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| was, did they get replaced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| And we're going to circle back and follow up on that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| and see if it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Yeah, I don't know at this point who fixed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| and if it has been fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| But we'll follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Doug, I have one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I was just saying, can you let us know next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1074)|
| 0:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Doug, in the award, it said price per mowing cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| is mowing cycle per mow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Yes, to answer your question, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| it's not been repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| He was promised to bring out new fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| And that's not been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| So hopefully, Doug and Chuck will get a hold of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| And we'll have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| And the fencing will be out there next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Item number 39 is a resolution approving various amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| to the Knox County Commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1121)|

| 0:18:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| I would like to thank everybody that was on the Rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Committee for their hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Well, we need to thank Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| I don't know that we worked that hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1149)|
| 0:19:09| Let's thank Jill, too, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| And Carson worked hard, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| But I think it was Jill and Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Jill gets the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Can we have a Commissioner Schoenmacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| This would become official 15 days after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| Is that correct or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| We're seeing a couple of nods yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| The mayor has 10 days to sign the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| It would be effective after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| It would be after next week's meeting, not after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| And did we discuss when we were going to implement this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| onto our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| As soon as they can, after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| If that's the next week, it should go in the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| Can we have a proper motion to second before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Page 7, item number 40 is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| amending the authority section of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1212)|

| 0:20:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| This has sort of been an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| And I'd like to ask Commissioner Nystrom, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| worked with Commissioner Caringen and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Gill on preparing this part of the handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| sort of a where did you start, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| know where we've ended up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Could I ask Commissioner Nystrom to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| Goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1251)|
| 0:20:51| I think with the first meeting we had was, let's see, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| We met originally up in the conference room, the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| of us, along with Mark Jones, to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| from an HR perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| After that, we worked with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Bud, which one of the attorneys was the attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Myers-Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Myers worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| So I think there was about three total sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| that we put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| I know we met originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Then I had a follow-up meeting with Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| And then I think I had a meeting with Chairman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| So I guess there's about three moving parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| over the course of this to come to where we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| And then I know that Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| as the chairman, kind of found some additional items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| after we got through the first wave of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| that he wanted to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| So probably about three total sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| that went into trying to pull together this manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| And that's what I'm wanting people to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| is it's been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| I believe we've probably been at it maybe a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| And I appreciate all the work and effort that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| The major moving part that I see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| is it brings all the personnel policies of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| reportees into one piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| The largest maybe change being that the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| has supervisory control of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| That being a change, I know now where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| to go with my next question, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| will sort of revolve around how we make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| that we have our bases covered on time reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| It's no big deal to me, but it is a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| that we somehow check off on time reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| And with the audit committee being responsible then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| for the internal auditor, I will make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| that we get there with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| As I've said, I recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| And thank you to Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| This is, again, something that she put a lot of work into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| and admires also in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| We have a motion, a proper motion, and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Those opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Item number 41 is a resolution expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| support of state legislative action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| to require county legislative body approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Resolution 904, express an opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| to any recommendation to re-adopt comprehensive growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| plans and support the state legislative action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| to repeal any requirement for comprehensive growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| We skipped one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Skipped 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| OK, so we're going to go to 41 first then, not 40, 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| Wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1441)|
| 0:24:01| I've read 42 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| OK, 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| OK, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Oh, are we discussing 41 or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| We're going to go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| We're going to go back to 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I have a motion to approve 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Gerald Green is here, I believe, somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| I'd like to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Please come down and give your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| Gerald Green, director of Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Commission 400 Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| And I've talked with staff, those of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| who don't have a tradition of 30 years of holding hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| with the growth policy plan, see it as an impediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| See it as an impediment, and so do the planning commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| It doesn't allow us to do the type of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| we need to do in recognition of the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| I'll pick out two areas in particular, Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| and East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| The Hardin Valley area is growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| around the schools, other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| where there are places that's appropriate for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| intense commercial development and denser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| That the growth policy plan, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| was adopted some 17 years ago, does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| allow us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| In East Knox County, the recently adopted community plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| recommended denser development around Star Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| the Midway intersection, around the Carter community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| and at the four-way end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| And we don't have the flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| and we're not allowed the creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| that we need to implement those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| with the current growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| We do need a comprehensive plan for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| and that can be done with our sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| continuing to update our sector plans with community plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| with corridor plans, such as we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| doing along the John Sevier Scenic Highway now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| But we need the flexibility and the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| to use tools that is not provided with the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| So staff and the commission both support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| With a proper motion and a second before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Those opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| OK, item 41 is expressing support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| of state legislative action to require county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| approval for the adoption of subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| or an amendment to existing subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| recommended by original planning commission resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| Commissioner Schoenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| I had a citizen contact me today that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| wanted to appear before this body, and they couldn't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| So can we move this with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| to the full commission so we have that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| for a citizen to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| And also, I'd like to include in the packet for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Tennessee code annotated 13-3-403,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| which is the law that dictates what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| And I'll provide that to Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I remove my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| I'll do the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Is he going to move with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| I make a motion to move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Since Director Green's here, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| to go ahead and hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Gerald Green, MPC 400 Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| This proposed legislation has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| discussed with the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| and with planning staff at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| And we see no issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| There are a couple of things we would like clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| One is that in the original proposed legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| there was a provision that would remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| the requirement for a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| before the planning commission as they consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| new subdivision regulations or amendments to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| We would like to see that included in the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| because the planning commission needs those public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| so that we can better craft the draft ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| and also identify issues that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| come before this commission before final adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| There are a couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| I've talked with Senator Briggs about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| One would be to provide in that draft legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| the ability for the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| to grant variances of modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| from the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| That would prevent, as a good word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| the necessity of a developer having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| to go to the planning commission for approval of the plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| then to the BZA for approval of the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| It could all be done in one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| And the planning commission could look at the project as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| The planning commission now has that under the current legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| has that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| And it does save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| So we would like to continue that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| and make it clear in the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Also, talking with the planning commission and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| we would like the legislation to provide the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| commission with the authority to delegate approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| of the final plat to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| The final plat is basically a technical document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| To be honest, I don't think the planning commission ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| reviews a final plat unless there's a big issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| By the time they get to the final plat, everything's been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| That's an as-built plan for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| By not requiring the planning commission to review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| and delegating that authority to the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| it could save at least four weeks from the time schedule that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| is required for approval of the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| So it would not preclude any review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| The current planning staff makes a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| that is sent with the final plat to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| They act on it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| But it would allow a faster turnaround on approval of those final plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Yeah, I just want to commend Gerald and his staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| for realizing where we were as a commission in frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| and kind of helping us work through that with the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| And I appreciate you all taking time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| And Gerald, I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| You came to me several months ago and suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| that you and I go to lunch once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| And I think it's been very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| And I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| I actually enjoy these meetings with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Well, I enjoy them with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| And it's great getting to know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| And sometimes I felt like a, well, I always say planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| have their heads in the cloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| So sometimes I felt like a helium balloon with no one holding the string.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| At least I've got someone holding the string now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| So I do appreciate that and the guidance and the conversations that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| It certainly helps me do my job better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| OK, and I would ask that you come back Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| so that you can be here for any questions that the citizen may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| OK, we have a motion before us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| And I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| I just need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| In May 3, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Oh, we need a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| OK, we need a second to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| I thought you said you needed a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| I was waiting on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| We have a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1873)|
| 0:31:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Item number 43 is the resolution amending the Knox County Code of Ethics, Section 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| entitled Acceptance of Gifts and Other Things of Value to Increase the Limit for Food, Refreshments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| Foodstuffs, Entertainment and Beverages Provided by Part of a Mill or Other Event to Not Exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| $50 per Occasion, Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| A little history behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| I have been speaking with my state representative, Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| and we have been going over the ethics from the state ethics viewpoint and the county's viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1929)|
| 0:32:17| And there's a lot of things in the state ethics that we can adopt to clear some things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| And this is just the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| I thought this would be a simple one to address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| There's more that we can address in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| But this is just to get us in line with the state ethics codes is what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1951)|
| 0:32:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| I think I'm going to ask kind of a technical question, but I think I know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| I just want to make sure I know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| And then if I'm correct, everyone else will have heard what has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| This is to increase the value from $35 to $50 of the actual meal or thing that is received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1978)|
| 0:33:11| We could attend an event where the advertised ticket price could be $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=1991)|
| 0:33:21| But if that's a fundraising setting, the $100 have nothing to do with what we are permitted to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2001)|
| 0:33:31| And as long as the actual value received is less than $50, we are still okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| I just want to make sure that I understand that correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| and that people that are watching or listening to us right now may say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Commissioner shouldn't be going to $100 events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Well, it's not a $100 event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| It's a fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| That particular setting is a fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| I guess tagging on to what Commissioner Wright said, I know having ran a nonprofit for a decade or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| often when you'd have someone, say, purchase tickets to a fundraiser and the fundraiser was $100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2047)|
| 0:34:15| if the fundraiser featured a dinner that was worth $30 or $40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| the person who purchased those tickets, what they could get a tax receipt for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| the nonprofit would only give them a tax receipt for $30 or $50 or whatever it might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| So I guess from a nonprofit perspective, that supports just what Commissioner Wright had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| I guess the only thing I would say on this, and this is more for the people at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| I'm struggling to think of anything that I've even really attended in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| or actually since I got on commission that was worth even $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| I think usually we seem to be going to community meetings as opposed to events or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| My only caution, I guess, that I feel when I read this is I don't want people to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| that we're trying to prove a raise or something like that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I get it from wanting to be consistent with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| But I guess I get a little bit nervous if it seems like we're trying to say that it's not like we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| beating on the doors to say come out to a fancy dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I mean, I literally can't think of, you know, we get invited to everything, but you still usually have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| I mean, I remember when I got elected, one of my professional peers here said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| I can't remember who it was, said, well, you need to get a bigger mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| And I said, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| And they said because you're going to get a bigger mailbox because you're going to be invited to every fundraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| in Knoxville, Tennessee, invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| They're not telling you to come for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Bring your checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Yeah, bring your checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| So I guess that's just some added perspective for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| So now let me go to the other side of the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| If Jimmy Buffett were to come to town and my son gave me a ticket to attend that event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| the ticket cost $250, my son giving it to me, taking me, his dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2171)|
| 0:36:20| as a county commissioner, taking me as his dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| I want to see people shake their head saying it doesn't matter who's giving me the ticket as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2185)|
| 0:36:34| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| It's got to be for your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| It does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| There are exemptions for close family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| There are exemptions for long-time friends and family relations, familial relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| whereby every year your family gives a Christmas gift to the other family, and they may be over $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2210)|
| 0:36:59| Well, that's not in your role as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| That's in your role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| It's a familial role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| And those are exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| But if it is a role in which you are a commissioner, then you're limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| In the current case, $35, if you pass this resolution, you'll be in alignment with state statute, and it will be $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| I would just like to know if anybody's faced a circumstance where they've ran up against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| that the value of the meal or whatever they're going to is more than $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| Yeah, the Clarence Brown Theater, the tickets that they send you are over the value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| so I'll make a donation to the Clarence Brown Theater Foundation so I don't have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| So, yes, I mean, there are, but I don't see the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| I don't see the need of raising, and I don't know what, I mean, six of one, half a dozen of the other to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| But, you know, at Clarence Brown Theater, when I go take my daughter there for Christmas, I make a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| So there are instances where it's over $50 or $35, but I don't know what the, you know, neither here nor there for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2277)|
| 0:38:11| But I think that we've got to be careful of the optics of raising the allowable ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| I thought the state was at zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| I thought they were at zero on meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| So I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2303)|
| 0:38:34| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| You put your mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Commissioner Schoenbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I was just going to say that I think that Commissioner Daley did a good job trying to bring us up to the state standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| We are the third largest county in the state, and I think that was a smart move on his part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| to look at how we can update some of our ethics rules to match the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| I just wish we would start with something besides something that looks like we're getting more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| I said looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| It's a perception issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| But aren't we doing this as a countywide, or is this just commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| It is countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| So we're talking about every department has to do with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| We're not just talking about ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| So I wanted to make sure that the public and I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| Did we get any input from the county administration as to how they felt about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2383)|
| 0:39:53| No, I did not because that's a question that wasn't brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| We have item 47, and I guess this is a good time for Jill to explain what has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| This is an ethics issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| We have to change the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Adopting, you know, the $35 to $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| There's not a citizen out there that I don't think, unless they hate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| that they're going to say anything about us taking the $50 following state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| I did not realize that we had to change some of the ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| and I'm glad Commissioner Carringer brought that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| because it does affect everyone in Knox County, this ethics policy does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| So, Jill, do you want to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| The ethics policy is adopt your policy, so when you change your policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| we have to amend the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| That's really the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| It reads at $35 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| If you change it to be consistent with the countywide policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| that would have to be amended also, and that's all that next resolution does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| And I don't think anybody here, us 11 commissioners or anyone that works for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| we don't have anything to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I mean, that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2474)|
| 0:41:30| Okay, we have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| Can we have a motion before us in a second to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2500)|

| 0:43:01| of the Knox County Board of Equalization at $125 per day for members, alternates, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| hearing officers and $135 per day for the chair and secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| This is resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| I don't see the properties assessor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Since he's not here to be able to answer some questions, I'd like to make a motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| we move without recommendation and we'll invite him to show up for the commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| I made a motion to move without recommendation since I see that the property assessor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| not present and we'll notify him to come on Monday and then that way we can ask him some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| questions regarding this because I can't find in the state statute where it says this amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| of money changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| And I did want to ask him also about the educational requirements for the people that serve on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| the Board of Equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| So since he's not here, and we did have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| The only thing, the state statute requires for you all to set a figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| And I want to ask him why he came to that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| But since he's not here, 125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| But I want to know the history behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| So we have a motion before us to pass with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| That's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| I don't know who was the second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| So now make your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2691)|

| 0:45:01| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Okay, we have a motion, a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2706)|

| 0:45:34| This is our first reading, Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Chris, I'd like to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| I did set this on the agenda and we just blew past it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| So I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| As a member of the Audit Committee, I'd like to add my name to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Oh, I was looking around the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| I just wanted to pause this for just a second and say the new chair of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| Jim Morrison, is also in attendance this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| He will be initiated by fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| We're not supposed to talk about the initiation until it takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| We are loading your wagon, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| There have been other things that have been before us this evening speaking to the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| and he has been a focused, good participating member of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2802)|
| 0:46:51| and I look forward to him chairing the commission of that committee going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| So, Mr. Morrison, would you care to give us a comment speaking to the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2817)|
| 0:47:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Jim Morrison, 2800 Solway Road, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| When I first heard that the outside auditor's contract had two four-year periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| and could not, after the second four years, would not be allowed to bid on the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2841)|
| 0:47:30| I believe you call it RFQ, request for qualifications that goes out, I recognized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2850)|
| 0:47:38| I've gone through a lot of the audit changes with Sarbanes-Oxley, Enron, all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| when a lot of this came about, and one of the things that was talked about a lot early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| was mandatory rotation of your outside auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| It didn't take too long before they realized that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| Large companies, that's expensive, and Chris can talk a lot to that and all that goes on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| but the compromise that generally came about was partner rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| And I'm with a publicly traded company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| I've seen the partner rotation work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| It's not just one more person from the same team running it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| They'll bring in a partner that hasn't been on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| He usually, I don't know what you call it, shadows the last year of the current partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2905)|
| 0:48:35| Then he's ready to take over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| Another thing I wasn't sure about, and we talked about it in the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| is how do other county cities treat this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| I didn't do a big study, but I did talk to Nashville and Chattanooga and a couple of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| and none of them have mandatory rotation of audit firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| I believe Nashville had just decided in one of their last audit committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| to address partner rotation with their outside auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2945)|
| 0:49:13| The thing to keep in mind here is all that's really going to change is we're not forced to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2953)|
| 0:49:23| at the end of the second term, the second four-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| But keep in mind, you all as the commission, if we're in the second or third year of the first period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2968)|
| 0:49:36| if we've got problems, concerns about the auditors, we can go out for bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| You all can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| We could recommend it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| So you're not losing control by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| It's just the interruption of bringing on new auditors, interruption to Chris's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| and like I say, he can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| And then when you play that into how Knox County does this with requests for quotes, you get qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=2999)|
| 0:50:12| I'm used to RFQs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| You're going to pick the firm, and then you're going to negotiate money with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| And every time you bring in a new firm, they're going to have a ñ that first year is going to be a big balloon to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| They've got a lot of hours just getting up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| So that's the money I see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| And David Shields, who's the other public member on the audit committee, we're not public accounting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| I mean, I've worked with them a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| I have auditors coming out all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| So we're not looking at it from the standpoint of the CPA community and the public accounting firms here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3046)|
| 0:50:55| They can put in whenever you've gone out for your request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| So we're doing it for what we think is best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| And with that, I'll let Chris sort of tell you some of the headaches they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3065)|
| 0:51:16| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| I think Jim kind of touched on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| For us, I think it's the whole cost savings component and the constant training as it revolves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3080)|
| 0:51:30| when you do that every four to eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| And I think he kind of talked about it to a great degree about you can gain the same thing by partner rotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| because you're not just changing the partner, you're changing the staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Hey, Chris, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| You know, when I get where we're ñ I hate to use the word comfortable because I don't think an audit's ever comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3112)|
| 0:52:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| But where we're at now, we really feel like we have confidence in who we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| And so what in your mind would say, okay, our auditors are not doing a good job because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| you look from the outside looking in, you've got three instances in the school system the last three or four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| where people have misallocated or stolen money and we didn't catch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| Or maybe we did and we don't know that the auditor caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| So looking from the outside perspective in, why would you tell the public, you know, we have confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| And I do have confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| I'm just saying perspective optics, what does it look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| I think the public has to understand the difference between a financial audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| which is what we're having done, and what would be a deeper dive into an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| And so they're going to do a random sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| And that's how they look for things and try to find these instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| And where there are audit findings, and we had some audit findings this year that help us to correct things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| and tighten internal controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| In a financial audit, you're not always going to catch everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| You need to have strict internal controls yourself to catch these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| And so, you know, they're not always going to, you know, find the a-ha things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| But they're going to rotate that sample year in and year out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| We have as a controller now, as a former auditor, he may be able to explain a bit better than I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| about how you rotate those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| And that way you try to, you're not just testing the same thing year in and year out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| You're testing, though, what you think is high risk and maybe a high dollar amount, high threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3209)|
| 0:53:37| And that's how you do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| And so, you know, I mean, easily to sit back and say, what on the auditors could catch those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| But really it comes down to a random sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| And so the audit committee has a lot of control, I guess, over, or a lot of not control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| but a lot of discussion with the external auditor in regards to, I guess it makes the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| the public needs to be made aware that the external auditor and the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| it's not just you and them, it's a whole group of people from the outside looking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| So everybody appears to be comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| And I would tell you, and Jim would tell you that they probably talked to Larry a couple of hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| a couple of weeks ago, to go over everything that was in our annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| every audit finding, how things came about, what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| And, listen, certain things that came out last week, that was actually done by the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| And while our external auditors were made aware, they were told very much to stay out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| We've got an investigation going on, don't impede, don't talk, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| And so we knew about those things, but it's just, you know, well, what's going to come out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| But very much so, there's a greater relationship with the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| with the external auditors than with us, although we work with them on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Commissioner Scamacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| I just wanted to compliment Mr. Morrison for bringing this to the audit committee's attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| and also I appreciate your service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| We're very fortunate to have someone with your background serving the citizens of Knox County, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3308)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Commissioner Neistat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| As another member of the audit committee, I want to let you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| we do have another thing that I'm excited to work with Mr. Morrison on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| If you look at how our audit committee meetings are a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| and while I know that notices about that meeting goes out on our website on our commission agenda area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| you know, there's really not a home for our audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| When you look, if you do a simple Google search, if you go to try to find it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| it's not an intuitive process to find out more about our audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| And when you look at other communities, even the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| usually you've got a section on a metropolitan's website dedicated to each individual audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| After our last meeting, Jim and I spoke about, over the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| to see if we can get something like that set up for our audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| not just to make it easier to communicate when our meetings are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| but also to serve as an archive for things like audits and those sort of things that are public documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| but are not intuitively easy to get to for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| So I guess what I would say is look over the upcoming year for us to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| to try and make our whole audit committee process, times of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| who's on it, agendas, those sort of things, for these public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| easier to access and more available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| I had a couple questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| By changing the chart, I believe if we are unhappy with the auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| we still have intervals where we can go out for a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| Annually, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| And would you say as a new audit company comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| there's a learning curve to knowing our processes and procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| No doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Do you think that in the long run that the longer an auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| if they rotate partners who are in charge of the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| will be able to do a more in-depth type audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| knowing where to sample as they learn our system and where our weaknesses are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| to actually give us a better end result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| I think no doubt that if a firm does it longer than four or eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| you're going to continue to look at different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| and you're going to look in different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| and change your sample and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| So I think no doubt that there's a deeper dive that gets handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| I mean, you can look at our audit findings from this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| and a lot of things were there that just from a standpoint that we're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| why is this just not coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| And it's the reason being that they're looking at a new thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| which is perfectly fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| and there's things that we need to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| and to help us to put more controls in place to correct things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| I think there's no doubt that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| I would like to clarify one thing I said earlier to Brad's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| It was the schools that actually turned in that report to the comptroller's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| and then we were contacted after that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| I need to ask the law director something on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| We will have to have two public hearings on this before our second vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| When does this have to be finished by in order to be able to be ready to go on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3532)|
| 0:59:02| I think it's 45 days before the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| You won't make the May ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Okay, so we would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| It's 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| I didn't think we'd make the May ballot is what I had in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| so it's got to be the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| I would get my two public hearings done and finalize it so we can get the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| How quick can we have these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| And how much time has to be in between each one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| I would usually set at least 15 days, but there's no law that says you have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| You have to have two hearings, and you can have one today and one tomorrow as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| What you really have to do for each hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| you have to give the public enough notice with specificity to make arrangements to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| So each one of those, you would have a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| On your rules right now, it's five days for your commission to be called under your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| So you would set one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| You could set one five days out, and then after that one, you could set one five days out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| So you could get two hearings in within 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| You could have one on your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| That would be very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| You could have one before your workshop, one on your workshop, and vote on it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| Well, I was hoping we'd be able to get to the second reading at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| At the minimum, that's what we need to be able to do, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3628)|

| 1:04:05| Spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3845)|

| 1:04:29| That's the spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| It's just a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| It says we can do the typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3876)|

| 1:05:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| Since we can't meet unless we all have a public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| I thought this would be a good time to give you an update on what Drew's here from Solid Waste, Tom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| and the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| I texted JJ today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| First of all, JJ, I requested that the Sheriff's Department put in their budget this year for a truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| and a full-time litter crew out there to help Solid Waste clean up illegal dumps where they may see tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| or something or other, and Drew can expand on that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| And then I believe that's going to be in the budget, and I hope we all support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| You know, we do have a huge litter problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| You know, there's a simple answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I know what that answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| I don't know why it's not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| I am trying to get meetings, and I've not got meetings yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| So, Drew, if you'll come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| Drew and I have had quite a few conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| I requested that Drew put in his budget and Dwight, wherever Dwight's at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| put in his budget for a full-time litter crew, and he's come up with a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| and I'll let Drew expand on that, and then I may have some follow-up questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Drew Thurman, Knox County Solid Waste, 205 West Baxter, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| So, we did, you know, we've struggled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| We've been here a few times talking to you about the change in the DUI law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| which has led to a major loss of probationary labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| We've tried a lot of partnerships to replace the loss of the DUIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Frankly, you know, if you got convicted of a DUI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| you would have had to do three days of pickup on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| That's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I don't think we have any hope of that coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| But, you know, we partnered up with Mike Hammond, criminal court clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| and they have a way to work off their court fees, community alternatives to prison program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| veterans court, recovery court, regular Knox County probation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| and we have seen folks come, but it's just not sufficient to replace the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| So, to give you some idea, we used to maybe have 100 or more people in a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| who would come through to do probationary litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| and now we're looking at two and three a week, if we're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| So, the commission last year appropriated some money for us to have some temporary laborers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| We have now hired four temporary part-time laborers, and they are working real hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4066)|
| 1:07:56| They are showing up on time, coming there, working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| doing a really good job to respond to the litter complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| In my budget request, and I don't know, I submitted it to Dwight and Lynn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| we had a request to make those four part-time temporary positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| to potentially make those full-time positions at a similar rate of about $10.50 per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| with benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| So, as you might understand, it's hard to recruit someone to give them 18 hours a week, no benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4108)|
| 1:08:37| It's just a hard thing to recruit for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| So, that's our budget request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| We're pretty happy with how, when you're paying them to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| they show up and they have pride and they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| They're picking up waste, working diligently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| as opposed to maybe some of the probationary labor, which you'd get them for three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| They'd show up the first day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| You'd have to explain to them everything you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| The second day, they kind of get the hang of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| The third day, they're really good, and then you lose them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| and these folks are really able to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| So, the past week or two, I know you all might be getting complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| I know the mayor's office gets complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| We take complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| They're able to respond a lot more quickly to reports of roadside litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4160)|
| 1:09:28| We still are getting these reports, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| This whole stretch of road is filthy for three miles, and that's still a difficulty for us to clean up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| but we are making some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| Again, still to give you some idea of the scope of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| the other day they were able to clean through for tickets that came in from the previous day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| but we took six, so they cleaned up three and took six more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| One of the reasons we take so many at this time of year is all of the vegetation's died back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| Everybody's driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| It's dreary outside, and you can see the litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| So, this is kind of a busier time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| We expect to have a lot more tickets, a lot more complaints coming in that we can respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4208)|
| 1:10:16| but we don't lose those, and we try to clean it up as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| So, I don't know if I answered all your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| That's just kind of a general summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| Well, hiring these full-time people will help, but that's not going to be the answer to the litter problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| I mean, I can give you 700 roads in south Knoxville, and you'll never get them cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| and that's the bad part about it is that I think we have all noticed in the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| since the DUI law has changed, and it did change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| It changed in 2016 to where it's not a mandatory 24-hours pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| It still can be issued by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| Judges' discretion is to pick it up, to go out and do community service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| but this is a step in the right direction, and, you know, in our conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4266)|
| 1:11:15| I've got a new hero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| His name's Judge Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| You know, you told me to Google Judge Potter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| so I'd have everybody Google Judge Potter out of Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| He's my new hero, and he's the one who started environmental, basically, the environmental court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| and he's tough on litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| He's tough on it, and I probably have to counsel Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| I had an appointment this Thursday with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| and Tom and I had to sit down and talk about some of the other things that we could look to do in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| but, you know, this is the first step that we can start, and it will help, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| and I appreciate everything Solid Waste has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Every time I've come to you, you've done what I've asked you of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| and you've gone above and beyond, and the citizens out there, and I hope other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| I think you have, I get calls every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Well, I don't say every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| I'll get a call or I'll meet somebody who says, you know, what can we do about our litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| and I say, bear with me, we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| So, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Mr. Daley, I should mention a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| We did include the budget that Drew proposed in our submittal to finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| so we included four full-time with benefits positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Part of what I think Tom and Drew have had a successful track record of doing in the past that could help us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| is in their relationship with Goodwill attendants that work at some of the convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| periodically you'll identify somebody who is on a solid road to recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| who has a good work ethic, good social skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| and could potentially be somebody to onboard into a full-time position like this with benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| And so I think potentially we could see some folks come out of the Goodwill organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| and into these entry-level positions that would stay with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| because a full-time position with benefits is life-changing for some of those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| The other thing that we have done is we've had some good partnerships with the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| particularly with Ivan Harmon and Scott Moore and the inmate crews that they supervise on a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| We've had some early conversations with them about trying to leverage that somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| They have a population that's pretty robust that might be suitable for this sort of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| but clearly our folks are not equipped, nor are they really authorized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| to take them out of the custodial environment and out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| But maybe some kind of partnership where a sheriff's office employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| and one of our employees using our equipment and vehicles could potentially take crews out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| and really just expand the numbers, which is the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| As Drew said, our numbers used to be significantly greater than they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| So I'm hopeful that that partnership with the sheriff's office will develop this year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| You brought up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Drew and I had spoken last week or so that, you know, there's a video going around of the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| you know, picking up trash or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| But Drew informed me that before we can even have anybody, they have to go through a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| And it might be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| And, you know, I can understand that, you know, you give somebody something to do and they give them a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4463)|
| 1:14:31| and they do that job, they're proud of what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| But we've still got restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| You know, this is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| I know it's going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| It's a Band-Aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| There's a finger in the dam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| But I do appreciate everything that you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| I'm sitting here thinking on the other side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| We're talking about trying to get people to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| And, Mr. Law Director, maybe you can tell me, how about the people throwing it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| What is the maximum fine you can fine people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| I mean, do we put people on notice in Knox County, all of a sudden we're not going to deal with this environmental problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| and we're going to fine you more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Or is there a limit to what you can even do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Well, I don't know how to say this, but we have signs that have all kinds of dollar figures on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4516)|
| 1:15:25| But the truth of the matter is you're going to be limited to Sessions Court in most of these instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| and you have a constitutional limitation of $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| That's what I was afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| It's kind of where we're hung without some legislative difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Good time to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Maybe, Drew, stand up there, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Mr. Law Director, one of our meeting was going to be, one of the discussion items was to be how they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| not a criminal penalty, but a civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| How the sanitation department, sheriff's department, you know, if they see somebody littering now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| it's just a criminal penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| And Drew and I had talked about it, and I think if we had a civil penalty where you're responsible for that trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| blowing out of the back of your truck or you throw that box from Amazon, it's got your name on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| you know, that was going to be our meeting Thursday, but like I said, I'd like to reschedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| So what do you think about is it possible for civil penalties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| I'd like for us to meet on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| The problem is they have due process and then the cost of litigating those civil penalties, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4592)|
| 1:16:42| could wash out everything you're going to try to get on the penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| But we can discuss it and try to come up with some creative approaches and then see if it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| I will get with Drew and you, and we'll reschedule if you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Okay, that will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Item number 57 is discussion regarding schools, cultural diversity training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4625)|
| 1:17:15| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| What I brought this up for, and I thought it was a unique concept in cultural, I think it's competency training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4638)|
| 1:17:29| and I miss, but when I saw it, one of the first years in college, I was in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| I took a sociology class and it said define culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| And we spent a whole semester writing stuff on the board what made up culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| I thought that was really something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| And then I realized it's competency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| I wish you would explain just as briefly as you can what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| And let me tell you what, I am taking this, I'll put a biblical term on it, I fear you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4677)|
| 1:18:05| which means I really respect or see the seriousness of what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4685)|
| 1:18:14| Like when we're told to fear God, that means we take him serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| And so I'm fearing you right now because I'm taking you serious for saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| And I don't mean to make light of it, so if you could possibly explain what this training is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4701)|
| 1:18:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| And your name is, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| I'm Melissa Massey, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| And I'm the Executive Director of Student Support Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| So this training is the result of the recommendations from the Disparities in Educational Outcomes Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| which spent about 18 months looking at models across the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| looking at our data of disparities within the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| looking at both academic data and our discipline data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| They made several recommendations, which was adopted by the Board of Education in May of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| And one of those was that we would do cultural competency training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| We did an RFP, and we have a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| And really what we asked for in that training was that the vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| which turns out to be the University of Tennessee College of Teaching and Learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| would supply to all of our staff, our teachers, our secretaries, our administrators, our cafeteria workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| everybody that works for Knox County School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| just an appreciation and an understanding of all of the rich diversity that we experience in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| And so this training, we did the first day of multiple-day trainings for teachers and staff yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4772)|
| 1:19:41| So they experienced three different sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| One of those was on culturally competent pedagogy, which really looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| when you think about all of the different students that you serve and you're planning your lessons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| are we including components that appreciate the diversity in the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| In other words, when you open up your text, when we're looking at literature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| are we giving students an opportunity to see people who have backgrounds similar to theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| Another component of that is just understanding implicit bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| All of us, through our own experiences, have attitudes, experiences about how we view the rest of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4812)|
| 1:20:20| And some of those things we're conscious about, and some of those things we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| And so we went through, with the teachers yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| the trainers went through some activities that just helped them to reflect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| what are your beliefs, what are the things that you've experienced that bring you to where you are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| so that when you're knowledgeable about those things, you're more likely to be more accepting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| to understand differences of different cultures, of different belief systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| about different ways that people are interacting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| And then the other piece is just the overall, they spent three hours in just an overview session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| of just understanding that social competence of, I mean that cultural competence of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| that everybody comes with their own gifts and talents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| How do we appreciate those? How do we recognize those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| How do we reconcile those when they are very different from maybe some of our ethical and moral beliefs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| And how do we continue to appreciate and make all of those people feel welcome and a part of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| So that's really our goals when we're looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| And it's a pretty massive training, because we have 8,000 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| and so we're looking at sending all of our staff through this day one training over about the next 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| So basically what you did to do the RFP is probably giving them an S.A.Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| to each individual you're going to be talking, I mean like the teachers, custodians, and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| to get their background and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| And then probably do an IEP and then an IET on it also to design this around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| That's what you got your 2599 RFP with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| So part of the process involves a pre-assessment from the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| They've developed a pre-assessment and a post-assessment so we can assess where are folks starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| and then where do they end in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| And part of what all of the participants do, there's a Harvard online implicit bias survey that anybody could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4930)|
| 1:22:19| You could take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| I could take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| But it will produce a kind of a profile about how some of what your implicit bias is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| and that's the conversation starter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| People take a look at the information that they're provided through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| and then the training team builds upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Okay, so you're having an online what they call cultural competency self-assessment orientate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| But that's just a small part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Everything else is in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Yeah, you have to start with something and find out what's wrong or what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| or their own biases and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| And then with each individual, because there are going to be differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| you do an individual assessment program, and then you have an individual assessment training, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4978)|
| 1:23:06| You have the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| So based on the information from the individual assessment, people have an opportunity to sit and engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| We're not tracking necessarily any of the information back to individual teachers or staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| We're looking at a global how are we, what do we look like as a school district today prior to that training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| and what do we look like in our attitudes and things that those assessments pick up on as a group or as a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| So we'll look at that information school-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| We're not necessarily tracking that back to individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| As a matter of fact, all of that data that would track it back to an individual teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| or an individual staff person has been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| Okay, and then at the end of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| you'll see how this affects the students' learning and how they're assessing and how they're, I guess, assimilating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5030)|
| 1:24:02| What are you, what's this about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| I mean, you're doing the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| What are we trying to find out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| So part of, this is kind of just a part of a larger landscape of activities that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| Like one of the things that we're doing is we're training our teachers and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| and using positive behavior support systems and restorative practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| If you're familiar with restorative justice, restorative practices is adopted from restorative justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| to really look at when we have ongoing issues with students, building relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| fostering supports for students to help them be successful in school, reducing our suspension days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| because we know that our students who are having the biggest struggles in school oftentimes are kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| who have ongoing discipline problems and they're no longer in the classroom because they're suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| So all of that is looking at many different components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| When you look at that disparities and educational outcomes task force recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| all of those pieces connect together to try to create a systematic plan where we're really addressing our disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| So our overall goals, they align directly to the superintendent's goals of eliminating disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| increasing academic achievement, and building that positive school culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| So when you look at this total package of the PBIS, restorative practices, cultural competency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| and some of the other components of that, that's all directly related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| So at the end of the day, we're looking for improved educational outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| and eliminating those disparities and overall positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| Okay. Sounds really interesting going on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| And one reason why I was just asking that is it sounded so massive to take on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| because there's so many aspects to culture that it doesn't affect just one part or another part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| It affects everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| And now you have this, I guess some kids are coming in there with PTSD now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| because of some of the things they've seen there and some about nutrition and that sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| and all kinds of different cultures that they come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| And I was wondering, the end purpose as a commissioner, I'm talking about the money now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| what do we expect to achieve at the end of this training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| So at the end of this training, then our expectation would be that as a result of this training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| and the other components that we have in place that we would see that decrease in our suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| our use of alternatives to suspension, and that we would have increased academic achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| And then again, that positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Those are really the outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| These are strategies to achieve the results that have been laid out by our superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| as well as to address the disparities that were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| through the Disparities in Educational Outcomes Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| How many hours will our classroom teachers be involved in this type training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| And what kind of a day would it occur on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| So we had the first training of six schools yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| It's a six-hour training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| There's a three-hour overview, and then there's an hour and a half on just understanding the different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| like biases towards disability, biases towards gender, biases towards race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| And then there's an hour and a half session on culturally competent planning and instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| And so that's kind of our phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| We'll get all of our employees through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| And then the long-range plan is that we're going to really create teams at each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| because all of our schools have, as all of you know, very unique cultures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| So we'll have some teams that will work with the trainers to kind of be that lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| that will kind of talk about what are the ongoing things that we need to do in this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| to make sure that we're incorporating the practices that we've learned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| and what are the things that we need to focus on as an individual school to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| So they're doing it on an in-service day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| They're doing it on in-service days and then our pre-service days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| We've got several scheduled, but two weeks we come back in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Ms. Massey, when you say there will be groups of teams that go into each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| will these be teacher teams, or what will they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| So we will ask administrators to select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| It could be administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| It could be just people from their staff who they feel like would be the appropriate team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| to work with the University of Tennessee staff to really expand their understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| so that they can do an analysis of their schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| and then that will kind of lead the next phase of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| How much time will that take them out of the classroom if they are teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| I don't anticipate that it would be a high level of time, and we're talking about 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| I mean, we've got to get through phase one for everybody before we're ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| But, I mean, I could anticipate they would probably be meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| but we would do that during like a planning time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| We would coordinate that so we're not impacting classroom instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| Going back one more time, Ms. Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| This is fascinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| So you right now have set a goal that you say these students are going to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| after the teachers and all the other staff take this course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| So this is a five-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| We have a contract for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| And, again, phase one is the day one training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| and then the phase two is creating those teams at each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| that will work on identifying what are our specific goals for our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| Because this first phase is just an overview of understanding the terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| of getting everybody thinking about this in the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| so that we recognize in order to get that team together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| to really analyze what our strengths and weaknesses are as an individual school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| we have to have a common language and a common understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| So going back to one of the statements you made that was really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| so what you're saying is, and I know we do, but we have an implicit bias,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| and that's within the school system that you're looking at for this implicit bias, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| So I would say that all of us have implicit bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| I mean, when you look at the research, everybody has their own experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| The things that have led you to where you are in your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| and we all have things that we believe through our beliefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| through our experiences about how we view the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| And so that is just a product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| We all have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| So, yes, we're asking everybody to kind of look at what are your implicit biases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| how does that impact your interactions, and to be reflective about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5432)|
| 1:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| Discussion item to set public hearing dates for charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Word notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| Monday, do we have, I know we have beer board, do we have any other meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| Prior to beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| Prior to beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| Retirement and pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| What time is it, 1.30 or 2.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| 1.30 to 2.30 or 3.00 maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| 1.30 to 3.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| Are you talking about the retirement and pension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| How long do you think that will take on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| While they're looking for that, Mr. Chair, we only have one item on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| We could possibly have a 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| That's a good idea, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Because what I'm looking to do is get one of these hearings out of the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| and that way we can set one before the work session next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| and that way at a regular meeting we can have this item ready to go to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| the law director and then the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| So how about we set that at 4.30 or immediately following?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| You could say 4.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| 4.15 or immediately following the beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| And that gives us enough time to notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| And we will have to add an item, a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| to the agenda for next Monday to set the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5547)|
| 1:32:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| I guess we're done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| Thank you so much, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5556)|
| 1:32:44| Item 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| Discussion item to receive an update of the Governmental Affairs Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| and the Board of Directors February meeting of the Tennessee County Commissioners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| Your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| Do you guys want to go ahead and do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| Or do you want to move it to the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| This discussion item was supposed to include the names of Commissioners Bussler and Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| who also attended the Tennessee County Commissioners Association meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| So I'll defer to Commissioners Bussler and Daley to give an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| on what the Governmental Affairs Committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Whoever would like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| Well, do you feel ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| This is for beauty, my friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| Yeah, I can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| I gave out a little handout to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| This was a great meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| We reviewed over 160 bills, and I think Commissioner Bussler will do the veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| And I just picked out some that I thought was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| There's many that were important, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| Don't get me wrong, but these are the ones that we need to watch closely here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| There's a lot of control stuff that's, you know, bills out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| and all of them are basically to increase the penalties for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| and all these dangerous drugs to a Class A felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| It will be heard this tomorrow in the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Intimate domain, it introduces and provides the governing sale of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| If we was to take someone's property, they will have the right of first refusal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| but they will have the right of first refusal at the current price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| If we took a piece of property and we did grading on it and improved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| they have to pay that amount there, not what it would bring, but what we may have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5687)|
| 1:34:55| I'm pretty sure that one will probably pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| It has no physical note on it, so it will probably go to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| The one I'm concerned about is I've got Seymour Volunteer Fire Department in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| This bill introduces a $600 stipend for education and completing their 40 hours of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5709)|
| 1:35:17| This has a physical note of about $32 to $37 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| I doubt seriously it will come out to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| but, you know, I've already sent an e-mail to tell them that I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| And these guys, these volunteer firefighters, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| $600 is a lot to them because they're volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| And it costs them a lot of money to go train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| Highways, roads, and bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| Introduce, reallocate funds generated by tax on overweight vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| We do, that's to go from the highway fund to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| We oppose that totally, and I'm sure Dwight would too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| Sounds like somebody's wanting to rub somebody's back or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| Also, there's a bill there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| I didn't put it down, but a 10% refund on garbage trucks from the gasoline tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| So you've got bills out there that, you know, I guess it's the buddy system at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| That will be heard Wednesday in the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Local government in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| As introduced, disqualifies a county employee from serving as a member of the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| with an exemption for current members on the county's legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| And it also requires that there be ethics, that you must acknowledge any type of ethics before a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5795)|
| 1:36:43| This has gone to, passed out of two committees already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| It's in, I think, in the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| It's already had two passages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| It's in a governmental committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| This has no physical note, and I believe that this one has a good chance of passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| And this was brought by Representative Kelly Kessling, who represents Clay County and Fentress County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| two of the smallest counties I believe we have in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| that they realize that they've got problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| These smaller counties have got problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| And sometimes the county commission don't want to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| and sometimes the state has to step up to do the corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| That will be heard tomorrow and Thursday in the House and the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| But now also the County Commissioners Association is strongly opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| Yeah, that was strongly opposed because there's one person, a county commissioner out of Wheatley County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| Wheatley County has 19 commissioners with a grand total population of 36,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| We have over 45,000 in our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| So this one county commissioner has been there for umpteen years and works for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| He didn't like it, so he preached a good sermon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| His sermon was fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| He changed from a unanimous support to a strongly opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| We'll see how that goes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| So, yes, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| Leans, as introduced, requires a county registrar to provide notice by mail to a landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| within ten days of registration of a judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| Maybe we need to agree with this 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| You know, sometimes you may have a lien on your property and you never know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| especially with these sovereign citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| Is that right, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| You know, my only concern, one of my concerns, is that we make sure that the register of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| whoever puts a lien on it, that there's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| They charge a fee to cover this cost that the register of deeds does not have to cover this cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| is what I'd like to see on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| I have not sent an email to that one, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| Local county governments, as introduced, requires members of county legislative bodies to elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| who, after election, are appointed to complete orientation training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| This will probably pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| It has no physical note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Anyone that's elected in August, new commissioners, is, I'm going to call it a requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| but there's no punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| You'll be required to do eight hours of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| We require our BZA to do eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| Our BZA has to do eight hours of training, because I was on BZA and we did that amount of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| So I don't see anything wrong with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| The University of Tennessee has a great online training tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| I've done a lot of training on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| There's a new system called CATE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| C-A-T-E is not the best in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| You know, I like those systems better, but I have went ahead and done two more trainings on the CATE system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| Mr. Chairman, for your records or for your knowledge, the week of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| the second week of August, I believe, is CTAS, the C-O-C-T-P, all these alphabets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| They're going to have a week's training in Murfreesboro for all new elected county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| and that would take care of part of this requirement of election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| So I don't know if anyone's going, but, you know, that's a budgeted item that you probably didn't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| So I'm just giving you a heads up that that's pretty sure the second week of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| It's a one-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| John helped me out register deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| Your county clerks, each day there's one section each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| It's not a whole week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| It's just one day in county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| I think I was told it was on Tuesday, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| We'll follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| And real quickly, Representative Brooks and Senator Briggs' utilities bill has passed on out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6038)|
| 1:40:48| into some governmental utilities committees, so they will be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| It's not scheduled this week, so it's moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| There's no physical note there, so let's hope that that will get passed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| And I'd like to brag on one of my fellow commissioners, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| He was appointed by the president of the TCCA to be on the bylaws committee, and that is an honor for Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6071)|
| 1:41:18| I don't think we've ever had anybody to serve on any type of committee like that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| And I appreciate John going and being there and serving Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| And we're making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| We are making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| Commissioner Gil, Carringer, Bussler, myself, and John, we're making a difference down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| And these other counties, they're coming to us, they're talking to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| and they want to know what's going on, and I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| Congratulations, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| Way to go, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Way to make me follow somebody that I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| Anyway, I'm on three different committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| One's veterans, transportation, and, well, I'm on four, legislative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| But anyway, I chose veterans because it came to my attention that there are nine districts in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6130)|
| 1:42:19| which I already knew, that deals with veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| And the largest population is the one that has Fort Knox in it, and they get more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6143)|
| 1:42:32| The second largest is Shelby County, and they get the second amount of money going into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| Now, Knox County has the eighth largest population of veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| and they get, here in Knox County, the eighth amount of money that's spent in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6164)|
| 1:42:53| We've got the third, but we get the eighth amount of money for our own veterans in this area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| And they're taking a look at that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| Also, they've passed some laws about tax relief for disabled veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| which looks like it's going to be moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| And that gives a veteran that is 100% disabled a much higher tax credit on their property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6188)|
| 1:43:21| Going through this quickly, I know some of this is, but the other one that was really important to me was this stolen valor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6201)|
| 1:43:29| which you have people that's indigents, never been in the services, that has a camouflaged uniform on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| and has insignias and these things up and down their uniform and act as a veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6215)|
| 1:43:43| And there's laws that are being passed now that we hope that will pass that will make that a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| because that's stolen valor honors that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6229)|
| 1:43:56| The next thing that they want to do is a procedure for them to be a part of the naming of veterans' homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| and associated buildings and grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| They want to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| They want to know how they can help naming those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| And they should have the ability to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| The other one that they were interested in was, well, that was from Dunn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6257)|
| 1:44:27| and let me get back to this other one over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| The last one I want to talk to you about is the selecting veterans to serve on state universities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| and community colleges as regents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| You have generals, you know, colonels, generals, high-ranking officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| that have the ability to serve on that to show what their value is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| and what they've done for us to give us the freedoms to be on those schools and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| And they want to be able to be there to show younger people what the military means to this nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6297)|
| 1:45:08| I thank you all for letting me attend these meetings and go down there and talk to other county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| The thing that I've learned, you learn a lot from other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| and I'm going to throw out something real crazy that was told to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| and I'm going to mention his name is Ron Berry from Roan County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| This guy has been on county commission for a long time, great veteran and things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| and he was talking about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| And it's kind of a unique idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| They have four high schools in Roan County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| They're going to go down to two and then they're going to build that campus next to Roan County Community College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| and it's going to be a massive type school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| In that school they're going to offer all the, you know, the languages, the arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| even I call it industrial arts or what is it called now, CTE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| They're going to offer that in connection with the programs that are going on at Roan State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6367)|
| 1:46:16| So a person could graduate from high school that already has a secondary degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6376)|
| 1:46:25| plus they could graduate and have the ability to get a job as a welder, HVAC, plumbers, the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6385)|
| 1:46:34| So they will have that degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| They could go right out and get a job and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| So they're preparing them for the last part, so when they walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| And another concept he talked about, and I'm not getting into this because this goes into the grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| he's saying that our grading system is also not what it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| Because are you holding back students because they can advance quicker, say they go through the schools quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6416)|
| 1:47:05| and our grade systems, K through 12, is that also regressive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6425)|
| 1:47:13| Because shouldn't you just be able to master the material that you've got and then move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| And then the last question was asked is 75 percent, is that a passing grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| or shouldn't we require 100 percent competency in that course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| And I'm thinking about that and I thought, well, I don't know if I should mention it or not, but that takes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| So when you go down there, you hear all these strange ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| and now by looking at your all's faces it may be that you shouldn't mention those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| But anyway, listen, thank you all for letting me go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| And then another follow-up bill that I thought this was interesting in the local government section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6471)|
| 1:47:59| it prohibits a municipality or county from adopting or enforcing an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| that prohibits a property owner from displaying the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| or a replica flag of any branch of the United States Armed Forces on the property owner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| And of course the Commissioners Association strongly supported that, but I thought that was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6498)|
| 1:48:28| Basically at the executive committee meeting, I was in the back in the audience and took notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6508)|
| 1:48:34| It was interesting, the commissioner from Hamilton County was mentioning that the relationship between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6514)|
| 1:48:42| the public school student population and the private school population in Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6522)|
| 1:48:50| there's 44,000 kids in public school and 15,000 in private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| So it's a total of 59,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| So 25% of their student population in that county is in private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| And they're looking now at a reduced number of kids going to public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6544)|
| 1:49:12| So I thought that was already on their radar screen of how they're going to plan for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| that public school population in their area may not increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6558)|
| 1:49:26| And of course the executive board approved all of the recommendations of the Governmental Affairs Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| including supporting anything that improves public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| They did do some committee assignments, and I was thankful and appreciated the opportunity I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| And because the Governmental Affairs Committee is so large now, because we had 30 pages of bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| that we had to go through, they've now split that up into two co-chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| So again, the Commissioners Association supported all 17 bills that dealt with veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6598)|
| 1:50:06| So that was it, and I appreciated the opportunity to go and represent this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6606)|
| 1:50:16| Discussion regarding the school budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| Yes, well I thought maybe we'd talk about that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| But just food for thought, we'll talk about it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| Again, what it was is the idea of all of us sitting down for a couple hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6630)|
| 1:50:36| with the officials from Knox County Schools when they present their budget to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| as opposed to on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| And we'll talk about that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| Okay, we do have to do a public hearing tonight, so I'm going to adjourn this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6647)|
| 1:50:54| and we're going to take a 10-minute break and reconvene at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| Can we make quick announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| We took so long we ran the mayor and everybody out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| Can I just make one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| I certainly appreciate individuals who are running for countywide offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180220?start=6672)|
