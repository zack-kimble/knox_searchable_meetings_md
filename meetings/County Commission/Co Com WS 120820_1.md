| 2:42:24| The fact is we are sitting here, and we are the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| So if we want to change that, let's do it in a proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| And let's go to the community, and let's ask them what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| And then let's come back and let's draw up something that we can put on the ballot in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| I don't see the need and haste in doing it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| when we haven't really gone out into the community and asked people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| Just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| I'm going to, I guess, repeat myself from a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| We had this on as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| I didn't vote for it, what was it, four years ago, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| And it was a campaign, a magnificently run campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| It was a professionally run campaign, if you think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| A lot of money was raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| It wasn't the old grassroots going around the clubs and sitting in front of Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9787)|
| 2:43:12| I mean, it was professionally done, which, legally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| It took a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| If I recall, it failed on Election Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| It was a photo finish almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| It passed early voting enough to carry it on Election Day because it failed on Election Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9803)|
| 2:43:29| and I guess that might be irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| That's not really because you can see that it was not a mandate necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| But I know the arguments I've heard, and I compliment Commissioner Wright for bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| I've heard Ms. Brawls, Amy's brought it up a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| and Commissioner Brown has expressed his viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9825)|
| 2:43:52| We've been doing it for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| I think it would be a mistake to say, gosh, let's change it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| We've done it two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| The way government moves, two years is not really very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| I think we need to give it another two or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9842)|
| 2:44:07| And if we do hear a huge clamor of discontent and unrest from the people at the clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9847)|
| 2:44:14| and just wherever we go during our daily lives saying, you guys aren't doing your job there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9854)|
| 2:44:21| or we need more people, or we need less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| That's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9863)|
| 2:44:24| I certainly don't think we need less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| I like 19, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| I think it got caught up in the emotions of Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| And if we'd have been dropping it to five, it would have probably passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| because people equated commission with what happened on Black Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9874)|
| 2:44:38| and they're all cutting deals on the side and let's get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| I think it was just that's just I'm exaggerating a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| But I think two years is not enough for this thing to run its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9884)|
| 2:44:48| And I think we're going to leave it as it is for another two to four years forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9888)|
| 2:44:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| Mr. Brown, do you want to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9896)|
| 2:44:57| I'd just like to rebut one thing that the campaign to get it on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| was done in a professional manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| It was professional, but it wasn't exactly ethical in a lot of our opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| because at least half the people sitting up here admitted to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| that they were approached somewhere at a Kroger store or someplace and was asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9911)|
| 2:45:17| are you against nepotism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| Sign this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9918)|
| 2:45:19| And they were supposed to read them what the whole thing was beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| It was not done right to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9922)|
| 2:45:25| Pure and simple, folks, that's the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| And I still feel that if that was put on a separate item on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| it would have never passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9932)|
| 2:45:35| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| I guess I started my two months ago on this talking about 432,000 folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9938)|
| 2:45:46| because that was the number that was brought up at the Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9946)|
| 2:45:52| 432,000 people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| Right now, if you look at taking a ninth of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9956)|
| 2:46:00| that means that each one of us are looking at responding to 48,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9960)|
| 2:46:08| If the number is 11 individual districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| and I believe that's been approached here about we need more direct responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9971)|
| 2:46:18| 11 commissioners is 40,000 people, or 13 commissioners is 33,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9978)|
| 2:46:26| Fifteen, the number that I have pulled out of the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9986)|
| 2:46:29| but it's not the number that I'm tied to, is 28,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| Or if we were old commission, you'd be responding to 23,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=9994)|
| 2:46:41| Those are huge numbers of difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10001)|
| 2:46:45| in how close representation is to the citizens of Knox County, a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10005)|
| 2:46:54| Now, I've gone through lots of other things that may relate to, for, or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10014)|
| 2:47:04| knoxcharterpetition.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10024)|
| 2:47:10| One of the biggest things I look at is that we're trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| that we want to hold the position that we're at right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10033)|
| 2:47:17| because the Charter Review Committee didn't look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| If I turn to the page of people that signed on the Charter Review, there's like 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10040)|
| 2:47:27| So you take 50 people and put that over 432,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| that's kind of an insignificant number of people in Knox County driving the train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10051)|
| 2:47:38| But if we look at the Charter Review Committee and compare the names of the 27 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10058)|
| 2:47:47| that were on the Charter Review, we find a significant number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10067)|
| 2:47:52| that are knoxcharterpetition.com people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10072)|
| 2:47:58| They sat here at the Charter Review Committee and said, one asked a question as if he thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10078)|
| 2:48:04| now that commission size has been reduced, that we're actually more like full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10084)|
| 2:48:11| In other words, the question was phrased around, we got a raise, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| All we got was twice as many people to look after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| A second person at Charter Review Committee said 19 was too many to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10100)|
| 2:48:27| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10107)|
| 2:48:28| Right now you do not have to really convince many people in Knox County where to go to get something passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10108)|
| 2:48:42| Another person at the Charter Review Committee said to me, Dave, now I see you out at all these functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10122)|
| 2:48:50| and you're wanting to be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| You're taking care of your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| And I said, yeah, you see me in West Knoxville and you'll see me this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10135)|
| 2:49:00| Commissioner Brown and I were with Dr. McIntyre at Gap Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10140)|
| 2:49:06| That doesn't play for a surgeon or a policeman or an insurance salesman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10146)|
| 2:49:15| or someone that's working in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| It only applies to us retired guys that don't have anything else to do but to get out and make waves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10157)|
| 2:49:23| And I'm going to stop going where Brown goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| He's too controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10167)|
| 2:49:34| I even had one person that responded on the Charter Review Committee said that, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| it's nice to be a member of a smaller body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10178)|
| 2:49:43| I was able to get what I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10183)|
| 2:49:50| And then about the sixth person that was on that committee, Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10190)|
| 2:49:55| said I really worked hard at getting signatures on the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10195)|
| 2:50:01| So to say that the size of Knox County Commission should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10201)|
| 2:50:05| or should not be gauged on what the Charter Review Committee said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10205)|
| 2:50:11| or the position held by the Charter Review Committee is fallacious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10211)|
| 2:50:16| They were against it from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10216)|
| 2:50:24| Now, the real reason that I brought this is for, as former Commissioner Schmidt said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10224)|
| 2:50:32| we need a robust discussion of what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10232)|
| 2:50:39| And I believe in that robust discussion we'll find that we may be hiding behind it's only been two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10239)|
| 2:50:47| but really it's been a lot longer than that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| If we don't do something now, how many years will it be until something is done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10251)|
| 2:50:58| And, really, I think a lot of people have thrown cold water on the fact of the lawsuit deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10258)|
| 2:51:06| I have talked about one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| That's whereas each district had two commissioners except one and had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10269)|
| 2:51:17| But the relative equality of the vote across those districts was each commission had two districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10277)|
| 2:51:26| I stood out here while one person said on the ñ not you, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10286)|
| 2:51:30| I pointed that way, but it was a person that was over that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| Not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10293)|
| 2:51:34| It was over that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| Said, now, let's do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| And he said, Dave, you've got your one vote and you've got two more votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10299)|
| 2:51:44| You've really got three votes in the 8th District right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10304)|
| 2:51:48| I believe that is a perfect illustration of the fact that between the plan that was in existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10308)|
| 2:51:57| to the plan that now exists, even though the plan that now exists could be legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10317)|
| 2:52:05| the difference between the plan that existed and the plan as it exists now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10325)|
| 2:52:10| has diminished the vote of the district where my second and third vote came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10330)|
| 2:52:19| If I have three votes in the 8th District, someone's lost in another district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| because those two at-larges, and I have to plead the same thing that has been said by everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10343)|
| 2:52:30| we cannot fault the at-large commissioners of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10355)|
| 2:52:36| You've given ñ you, Chairman Hammond, have given us very able leadership as the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10356)|
| 2:52:42| Ed Schaaf sitting on the audit committee has given us very able leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10362)|
| 2:52:52| But what's happened is we have other committees and good, valid things that need to be checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10372)|
| 2:52:58| that we aren't checking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| There's not 19 of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10380)|
| 2:53:03| There's only 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| Two have to look countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| I've pointed Tony Norman out before, and I'll point him out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| I believe I can quote him correctly and say at times he's been committed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10391)|
| 2:53:21| The local paper likened me to the Lone Ranger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10401)|
| 2:53:28| That was really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| I can remember between the ages of six and nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10410)|
| 2:53:34| my mom and I in a two-room house, the kitchen was a porch add-on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10414)|
| 2:53:38| and the refrigerator was sitting right beside that door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10418)|
| 2:53:41| and the radio was way up out of my reach and she played the Lone Ranger so I could listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10421)|
| 2:53:48| I really appreciate what Charlie Daniels did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| and I've seen him and I've shook his hand and I've said that to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| The most important thing, though, that you need to notice that about three or four days later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| he had another cartoon which was a crossword puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10438)|
| 2:54:02| The letters were green and the clues were what do commissioners raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| what do PACs raise, what's it take to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| I don't know what the four clues were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| But the money, the answer was money, money, money, money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10452)|
| 2:54:18| Compare my race in the last commission race to Commissioner Shouse's race, money raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10458)|
| 2:54:28| You've got Commissioner Brown and myself both, I think, and Commissioner Hornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10468)|
| 2:54:34| I believe you've taken all three of us out of the race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| because that kind of money limits participation in county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10478)|
| 2:54:45| Now, I've really got myself way far afield of where I wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10485)|
| 2:54:50| I've talked about the, I'll say, I'll use this one man, one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10490)|
| 2:54:58| but now I want to go one step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| We've dug in the Tennessee Code Annotated, whatever that word was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10501)|
| 2:55:11| So now let me give you another one to go look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| TCA 5111E, and I'll paraphrase, and you can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10514)|
| 2:55:23| It's just one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| It says that districts will be reasonably compact, contiguous, and not overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10525)|
| 2:55:35| It goes a little bit further and explains it in the next paragraph, F and bullet point 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10535)|
| 2:55:43| emphasizing that they don't overlap except that the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10543)|
| 2:55:51| whose lane we don't play in, can say a precinct, voting precinct location can be split,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10551)|
| 2:56:05| but only if there are 20 or more legislative bodies in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10565)|
| 2:56:12| which I think influences the fact or reinforces the fact that commission districts don't overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10572)|
| 2:56:21| True, we are getting down to the end of when we can consider this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| and that's the reason I brought this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| because I think it's my strong belief it's something that needs to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| but there is time left in there for us to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| We don't have to have anything over to the election commission by the 7th of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10596)|
| 2:56:42| I would ask again whether or not we have to have public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10602)|
| 2:56:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| And the reason that I really say that is because the true public hearing on what we, as county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10610)|
| 2:57:00| might offer to the voters, as I said in my adder resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| that Section 2.03 of the charter be offered to the voters of Knox County to change the size of commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10625)|
| 2:57:13| that's the ultimate public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10633)|
| 2:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| I would be totally against putting something on the ballot at this late date on one reading and violating our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10638)|
| 2:57:25| We have established rules for charter changes that we have two readings and that we have public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10645)|
| 2:57:30| Those are the rules that we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| And if we're going to take the position now that, no, we're not going to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| because we want to bypass that just so we can hurry up something, I am 1,000 percent against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10656)|
| 2:57:42| I feel like that we need to go to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10662)|
| 2:57:43| I feel like we need to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| And let's put together a good plan, not that this isn't a good plan, but let's put together a plan and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10665)|
| 2:57:51| I mean, we have a chance to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| It's not going to affect anybody sitting here now, and some people have six-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| I would agree that it needs to be vetted out, but it is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| If the Charter Review Committee votes to do this, it's on discussion for this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10681)|
| 2:58:07| Then that's entirely up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10687)|
| 2:58:08| I'm talking about the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| What I'm saying is that it is possible it could be on if they chose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| The Charter Review Committee is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| They've got time for one more meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| They can have those two meetings before it has to be in to the election office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| I'm not on Charter Review, and it's up to them to do whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| But with this commission, I'm totally, totally against bypassing our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10707)|
| 2:58:32| We wouldn't be bypassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| Yes, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10714)|
| 2:58:35| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| They won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10716)|
| 2:58:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10717)|
| 2:58:38| Now, Charter Review, as I said, they can do whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| But this commission has adopted rules, and I believe we need to abide by our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10720)|
| 2:58:43| I think they were put in place for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| I think they're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| I think that gives us a reason to have public hearings and do those things and have two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| Just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10731)|
| 2:58:52| I'm only one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| What's the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| The motion on the floor is sent on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10737)|
| 2:58:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10738)|
| 2:58:59| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10739)|
| 2:59:00| We'll send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10742)|
| 2:59:03| Back to page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| Item 37, consideration of acceptance of new county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10745)|
| 2:59:10| A, Crippin Corner Lane located at Crippin Corner Subdivision, District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| B, Carnes Crossing Lane located in Carnes Crossing Subdivision, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10754)|
| 2:59:19| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10762)|
| 2:59:23| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10763)|
| 2:59:24| Next, we have a discussion regarding the funding of the Flumist Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| Dr. Buchanan, I know that you have been looking at private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10768)|
| 2:59:37| Where are we with that, and can you update us on where we are on the status of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10777)|
| 2:59:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| First of all, I just want to, Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department, 140 Damron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10783)|
| 2:59:49| I just want to bring those of you who don't know and commission up to down where we are with Flumist funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10789)|
| 2:59:55| Way back when, we got a very large grant to pay for Flumist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10795)|
| 2:59:58| and have been giving Flumist for free to the students in Knox County, both public and private schools and daycares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10798)|
| 3:00:05| This will be our seventh or eighth year this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| And really haven't closed schools for child flu during that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| And so between the grant money that we got and the Vaccines for Children Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10815)|
| 3:00:20| and then another federally funded program called the 317 Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10820)|
| 3:00:25| we've been able to keep buying this vaccine and giving it for free to the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10825)|
| 3:00:31| 317 Funding went away last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| They've kind of phased it out, so this year we won't have any 317 funding at all to pay for Flumist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10835)|
| 3:00:42| So with the grant running out and losing 317 funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10842)|
| 3:00:46| we are now faced with how do we keep this program going and continue to have it for free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10846)|
| 3:00:53| And the reason to continue to have it for free is if we start charging for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10853)|
| 3:00:58| then what's going to happen is those kids who don't have insurance are going to be the ones who suffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| and don't get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| The kids with TennCare will get vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| and the kids with private insurance that we can bill will get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10866)|
| 3:01:10| But then you're going to tell working-class parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| sorry, we can't vaccinate your child because your health insurance doesn't pay for it in a public program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10873)|
| 3:01:18| I'm not ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| We're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| That's not where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| So we're looking for different funding options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| We'll be billing this year for those that we can bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| and we have a third-party biller who will be billing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10888)|
| 3:01:32| We hopefully will be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| We're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10894)|
| 3:01:35| We have asked the hospital systems to help, and I think we'll get some help from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10895)|
| 3:01:40| We have asked Knox County Schools to help fund this program as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| and they're willing to help fund the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| We've also asked all the private schools to help fund the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10905)|
| 3:01:49| We haven't heard back from the private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| That went in a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| We may follow that up with a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| We are also, we've talked to some corporate sponsors, have possibility of some corporate sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10915)|
| 3:02:00| None of those are solid at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| We're committed to doing this again this year for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| but we're really looking for a way to keep this program and make it sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10926)|
| 3:02:10| Depending on how many kids we vaccinate, it's anywhere from $400,000 to $600,000 to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10930)|
| 3:02:16| and this is $15 a kid is basically what we do this for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10936)|
| 3:02:21| We don't count my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10941)|
| 3:02:22| We don't count my staff's time and the run-up, the school staff's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10942)|
| 3:02:27| That's how much it costs for vaccine, how much it costs to hire the temp agency that goes out and does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10947)|
| 3:02:33| So it's really a very economic program, and as you know, really benefits the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10953)|
| 3:02:40| Parents are at work because their kids are getting vaccinated at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10960)|
| 3:02:43| and their kids aren't getting the flu, and they're not homesick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10963)|
| 3:02:46| And so employers like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| Mom and dad aren't out sick because their kid brought the flu home from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10968)|
| 3:02:53| Again, employers like that, and so do moms and dads because nobody likes the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| So it has a true community benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| But we're at a point where it needs to now really become a community program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10980)|
| 3:03:05| The Knox County Health Department has been funding this for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| and I feel like it's a great public health program, but I believe we're dedicated to staying in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| but we're going to have to find new ways to fund it to keep it going and make it sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10993)|
| 3:03:18| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| Commissioner Hammond and Commissioner Broyles had asked us to entertain questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11000)|
| 3:03:24| or ideas of alternatives for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| You know, I don't have an exact dollar amount of where we are as far as making this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| I do know that we are committed to making it happen this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| We may not be able to do phase two, which is where we go back and vaccinate those vaccine-naive kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11016)|
| 3:03:41| who need a second dose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| We may have to skip that this year just because the funding shortfalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| But that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| So with regards to private funds, have you raised any yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11028)|
| 3:03:51| We have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11031)|
| 3:03:52| We don't have a commitment from anybody at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11032)|
| 3:03:56| And this is a new avenue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| It's not something we're accustomed to doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| So, no, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| I was just going to make a comment and add on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| I believe there was a study in Japan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| It was in another country a few years ago where rather than giving flu shots to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11052)|
| 3:04:17| and trying to inoculate the general population, they just focused on school kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11057)|
| 3:04:23| because, as you alluded to, the vector for transmission of the flu is the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11063)|
| 3:04:29| And if all your children are vaccinated, you don't have very much flu in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11069)|
| 3:04:35| And it really is you don't need to vaccinate everybody, just try to vaccinate the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11075)|
| 3:04:40| I would argue that the American approach to flu vaccine is a little backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11080)|
| 3:04:45| But other people besides me make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11085)|
| 3:04:49| But the point I'm trying to make is that you're not just saving parents from time off work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11089)|
| 3:04:54| They're not bringing flu home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11094)|
| 3:04:55| That is the vector that is spread to the general community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11095)|
| 3:04:58| That's how Grandpa gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| He gets it from the spread from the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| It reduces flu disease burden throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11102)|
| 3:05:06| And Grandma, Grandpa, and little baby Joey in the crib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11106)|
| 3:05:12| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11112)|
| 3:05:13| If we received zero funding, profit, or raised zero money, how much would it cost to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11113)|
| 3:05:19| It depends on how many kids we vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| It's anywhere from $400,000 to $600,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| And right now, again, like I said, we're committed to making sure this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11125)|
| 3:05:30| We've got a commitment from Knox County Schools and possible commitments from the health systems in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11130)|
| 3:05:36| We still have some money left in the Flu Miss program, and I will find the money within our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11136)|
| 3:05:41| And, again, UPA, who is our third-party biller, is really committed to helping us make this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11141)|
| 3:05:47| and be able to bill for those vaccines that we give because, you know, you've got to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| You've got to get paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| It's not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11153)|
| 3:05:54| And so we're committed to doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| But, again, it's $400,000 to $600,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| Martha, what percentage, you mentioned that you're doing daycares and private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11161)|
| 3:06:05| What percentage of it, I think what we're responsible for would probably be from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11165)|
| 3:06:10| But what percentage of it are you doing for the private schools and for the daycares?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11170)|
| 3:06:17| You know, the largest portion of the vaccines that we give are obviously in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11177)|
| 3:06:22| because we have more public schools than private school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11182)|
| 3:06:28| And I don't have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11188)|
| 3:06:29| I can get it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11189)|
| 3:06:30| But I would argue, though, to really live out, you know, vaccinating kids in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11190)|
| 3:06:36| we need to vaccinate all the kids in school, not just the ñI mean, the public schools are the largest portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11196)|
| 3:06:42| but Knox County kids that go to private schools are also living in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11202)|
| 3:06:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11207)|
| 3:06:48| And their parents are taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| Less than 5% then, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11210)|
| 3:06:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11212)|
| 3:06:53| I can look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11213)|
| 3:06:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| Dr. Briggs, and if you just need to inoculate those that are the carriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11215)|
| 3:07:01| But is that 400,000 to 600,000 over and above what you're able to bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11221)|
| 3:07:08| We've never successfully billed for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| Oh, this will be your first bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| We tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11232)|
| 3:07:13| Well, we didn't try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11233)|
| 3:07:14| VaxCare last two years ago tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| And there are lots of rules about being able to bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11239)|
| 3:07:22| One of them is that you have to have a provider on site to bill for vaccination clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11242)|
| 3:07:28| We're fighting that battle with our third-party biller and insurance companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11248)|
| 3:07:34| And to have a provider on site just raises the cost of the program because you have to pay myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11254)|
| 3:07:40| or not me, but a nurse practitioner that we might hire through a temp agency to be there for three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11260)|
| 3:07:47| And they're more expensive than an RN or an LPN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11267)|
| 3:07:52| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11272)|
| 3:07:53| Thank you for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11273)|
| 3:07:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11274)|
| 3:07:55| So we'll continue to stay in touch as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| I'll keep you posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11276)|

| 3:08:00| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11282)|
| 3:08:03| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11283)|
| 3:08:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11284)|
| 3:08:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11285)|
| 3:08:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11286)|
| 3:08:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| Any other business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11290)|
| 3:08:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11291)|
| 3:08:12| I want to remind people we have a pension investment committee meeting tomorrow at 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11292)|
| 3:08:16| I think Commissioner Norman and I are on it, or I know we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| And, of course, you and Commissioner Briggs are on the pension meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11299)|
| 3:08:22| So anyone and everyone is welcome at the commission conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11302)|
| 3:08:29| 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11310)|
| 3:08:31| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11311)|
| 3:08:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11312)|
| 3:08:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11313)|
| 3:08:34| I almost slept through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11314)|
| 3:08:35| This is a gun issue, so if you don't want to hear gun issues, cover your ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11315)|
| 3:08:42| This is a letter that was addressed to the two at large and myself related to the discharge and noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11322)|
| 3:08:49| and possible safety hazards relating to weapon use target practice in northeast Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11329)|
| 3:09:01| I've spoken with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| He is personally, he, Sheriff J.J. Jones, in his eminence, has visited this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11345)|
| 3:09:15| talked to the two property owners, and there is nothing illegal taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11355)|
| 3:09:22| So you have a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| This letter was addressed to you and Commissioner Schaust, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| So it's been handled by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11370)|
| 3:09:31| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11371)|
| 3:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120820?start=11374)|
