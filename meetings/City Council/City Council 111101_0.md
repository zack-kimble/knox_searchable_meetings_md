| 0:04:38| citizens can still vote early for the City of Knoxville regular and state senate special primary election through November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=278)|
| 0:04:48| The following city positions will be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Mayor, City Council, District 5, and City Council at large seats A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| The turnout in the primary was low, so let's see if we can do better in the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| The National Trust for Historic Preservation presented its National Trust Department of Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| and Urban Development Secretary's Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| for the restoration of Menvilla Manor in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| The project was one of 23 award winners honored by the National Trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| during its 2011 National Preservation Conference next week in Buffalo, New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| This is a great honor and one that I owe thanks to the council for its support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| Today we have with us a couple of people that are involved with that, David Arning, Ed Ellis, Kim Trent, Mark Allen, and Chris Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=345)|
| 0:05:57| If any of you would like to come down and say a few words, you're more than welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| If not, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| But you're more than welcome to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=368)|
| 0:06:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=388)|
| 0:06:43| Cheese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=403)|
| 0:06:58| Let me thank all of you for your hard work and the great outcome that has brought national recognition to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=418)|
| 0:07:07| Are there any reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Yes, sir, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| We just postponed the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| and that's because we're going to have another joint workshop with the county commission next Thursday, the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=439)|
| 0:07:29| here in the main assembly room at 5 o'clock p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| Also, I just wanted to mention that the University of Tennessee women's golf team hosted a Pac-10 SEC competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=453)|
| 0:07:45| at Holston Hills Country Club last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| There were 23 teams, 120 participants, some of the top golfers in the country, two of the top conferences in the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=468)|
| 0:08:00| and last year Stanford University hosted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| This year the University of Tennessee did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| and there were approximately 500 people who came to Knoxville to either work or watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=485)|
| 0:08:16| or be part of as a staff of this golf tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| And I went out there, and I just want to say it was a very impressive group of people, young ladies in town here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| and, of course, they spent a lot of money in our city, so we appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| And as Councilman Pavlis says, that's heads in beds, which is a lot of revenue for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| So I just wanted to mention to the University of Tennessee that I would mention this tonight, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| Thank you for attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Councilman Pavlis, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Yes, I would just like to say that we had a great meeting a week ago Monday at the Urban Wilderness Arts and Trade District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| There was about 25 business owners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Councilwoman Palmer and Councilman Grieve were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| But I particularly wanted to thank State Representative Harry Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| who was doing a lot of legwork for the south Knoxville portion of my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=548)|
| 0:09:17| seeing what we can do not only for perhaps different traffic patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| but if there's some relief at the state or some things that he may be able to do for us at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| And he's really doing a lot of hard work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| and I just want to appreciate and acknowledge his hard work and the Councilmembers that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| It's a very important meeting, and I just want everybody to remember that south Knoxville is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Councilwoman Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| As Council's representative to the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| I would like to welcome members of the Youth Action Council who are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| and I'd like to ask them to stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=594)|
| 0:10:04| The chairperson this year is Rebecca Carson, and while she comes forward, I'll just say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| For those of you all that are not familiar with the Youth Action Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| it's a collaborative partnership among the City of Knoxville Mayor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| the Knox County Mayor's Office, and the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| The Youth Action Council is comprised of a representative body of teens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| drawn from public, private, and homeschooled students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| and is charged with ensuring that the Action Council is a forum for teens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| and that their concerns can not only be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| but to give them a forum for civic engagement and resources for community change in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| So, Rebecca, I yield to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| And welcome, and thank you for your work this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Yes, like you said, we are a representative body of teens, private, public, and homeschooled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| and this year we actually broke it down into three subcommittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| We have the Environmental Affairs Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| which is dedicated to raising awareness about recycling and composting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| and we're also dedicated to mobilizing these developments in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| The second subcommittee is the Youth Summit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| They are dedicated to promote events that offer a fun, safe, and non-destructive alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| that teens can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| And the third subcommittee is the Cultural Competency Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| That committee is dedicated to providing students with information about different cultures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| and they're also devoted to planning events that portray how various people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| and cultures do things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Each year, we as the Youth Action Council are doing things to inspire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| and empower teens from across Knoxville to become empowered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| to become involved with community issues and projects that are important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| Thank you for acknowledging us, and we hope to be involved with your work this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Rebecca, thank you for coming tonight, and thank you to every member of the Youth Action Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| Your work is important to us and important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=720)|
| 0:12:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| A day is a resolution confirming the appointment of Albert Baugh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| to the City of Knoxville Public Arts Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=741)|

| 0:13:42| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=822)|

| 0:13:57| I don't know if we have a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| If you could just take a minute and just kind of get us focused on what it is we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| If you'd give your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| I'm Alan Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| I'm the director of the Knoxville-Knox County Emergency Management Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| We're at 605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| The Emergency Management Agency is the local agency that coordinates emergency response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| as far as we manage an emergency operations center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| This past winter, when we've had severe weather events or any kind of a large-scale event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| there needs to be a central coordinating point for those responses, and one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| we do is manage that operations center, which is in the 9-1-1 building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| That's where our place is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| We do several emergency exercises a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| We do exercise with the Department of Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| We design and manage a mass casualty exercise for all the hospitals as part of their accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| We do those every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Emergency planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| We work a lot with the Health Department, Police Department, and Law Enforcement, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| Fire Department as well, as far as kind of coordinating the whole system and making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| everybody works in a coordinated way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| You kind of bring the team effort to bear on problems before they happen, so that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| they do happen, you're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| That's exactly it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| If you've heard of FEMA, of course, there's FEMA on the federal level, and there's a Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Emergency Management Agency on the state level, and then we're the local equivalent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you, Mr. Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| I'd just like to ask if you all are involved at any level of the EAS alert system that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| getting ready, the special alarm that's going to happen, I think it's November the 9th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| Is that part of the Tennessee Health Alert Network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| This is a national test that I think is going to happen, it's going to last for like three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| minutes as opposed to, you know, generally the 30-second or whatever it is that we normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| There's an emergency alert system that is part of the, actually is carried by the Weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| Service radio system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| If you have a weather radio, it is broadcast through that, and that is not just a warning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| for bad weather, it can be a warning for any kind of a major event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| And so that system is, they're making a kind of a production out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| One of the first thoughts you're asking about, part of that is the Tennessee Health Alert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Network, which I'm one of the persons who's notified on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| This is something that the state health department does, notify emergency responders of an outbreak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1011)|
| 0:17:00| of a disease or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| And so it's a pager system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| And so that's actually a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| It's my understanding that this is the first time that the EAS system has been tested nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| you know, nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Right, it's usually either statewide or just local, like if we have something like a tornado| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| warning that is issued from Morristown, and it's just that one small part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Well, I'm sure there'll be people that won't, I would say there'll be a lot of news on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| leading up to it, starting probably tomorrow or so, but I just want to let people be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| that that is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| It's going to be a three-minute alarm instead of a 30-second, and that will probably alarm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| some people that haven't heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| But I'd just like to thank you, too, for the hard work you did in keeping me informed when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| the storms this past year, Alan was fantastic too, giving me his cell phone number, he kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| me in constant contact with what was happening, particularly in South Knoxville, and I thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| you for that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1077)|

| 0:18:56| Chief Roush, I'm just curious, is this part of that Amoresco effort to upgrade and save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| energy or is this an independent activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| This is an independent activity that was budgeted separately on our physical budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| It was something Amoresco could not do, so it's a separate capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| But you expect, with this replacement of these units, to get more energy-efficient units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| and save money in the long run, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1160)|

| 0:20:34| The library was on the upper floors, and there were commercial buildings on the bottom floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| So we'll be taking tours of the entire building, led by Steve Cottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| And underneath there, the lost sidewalks of Knoxville, we'll be taking tours of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| And then there's going to be a screening of All the Way Home, a movie based on James Agee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| novel, all right there in that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| So just plan on spending your entire Friday night with the public library on the 100 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| And thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| For the record, if you just give your name and title and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| My name is Nelda Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I'm manager of the Central Library, Lawson McGee Library, Knox County Public Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| This side of the room would like to be added to the resolution also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Councilman Verratti, was that the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| I just wanted to thank the library for the job you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| You know, you can be a poor kid, you can be a grown up that hasn't had maybe all the education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| you want, or someone who's had a ton of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| But the public library is there with tons of information, with books, with helpful people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| that do reference work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| And it's really an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| It's really our key for self-learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| And I appreciate some of the online stuff you guys are doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| So keep up the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| It really is part of the healthy aspect of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| And I think you do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| You can also be the mayor of Knoxville on the city council and use the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| I'm very grateful to live in a town where so many of my elected officials are regular library users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Let me add that I happened to be at the library on Sunday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| And I got some very good help with information that I was seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| And I've been a user of the library for quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| I know you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| You do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| 12A is an ordinance to annex certain territory adjoining the bounds of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| an area generally being described as attractive land north of Callahan Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| and approximately 680 feet southwest of the intersection of Keck Road and Callahan Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| which property is to be incorporated into the limits of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| and to revise the boundary of Ward 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| This annexation has a small error in it because between the time the ordinance was written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| and the time it came to pass, Precinct 39 moved into the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| and this property is actually now located in the 3rd District in Ward 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| So we need to amend this document to say Ward 40 instead of Ward 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1424)|
| 0:23:54| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| And I guess it's just on the amendment, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| We're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| And now we'll vote on it as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| So we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1459)|

| 0:25:22| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| We're in the process of annexing approximately 117 acres of property into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| What effect does that have as far as taxes for us and expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| I think we have someone coming to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| Could you give us your name, sir, and title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| I'm Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| I'm a downtown coordinator for the city, formerly urban growth manager for the city and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| still urban growth manager for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| As far as taxes go, the tax revenue generation will be around $70,000 for this whole round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| of annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Services, there's a condo unit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| Typically, we don't have as many service costs there as we normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| Most of it is vacant property, so, you know, we'll get even more taxes in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| So it's a pretty good win for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| All these were agreements we had three or four, five, six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| They're just now coming to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| We couldn't go beyond the mayor at the time when he was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| We didn't know he was going to leave early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| And also some of the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| I mean, that just goes to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| But that's why they're on there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1599)|

| 0:27:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| I was going to ask a question to Chief Rausch about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| There were two things, and I think we spoke before the meeting about one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| The reporting requirement was that it be done the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| And I asked him if it should be the next business day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| I think you said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| It's kind of a 24-hour clock kind of thing, the very next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| You don't have a problem with it being Sunday or a holiday in terms of the police department's over 24 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1649)|

| 0:27:37| The second one has to do with the section 16-208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| It's on page 7 of the agenda-type document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| It seems to require the chief to process applications within 10 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| and you can deny applications for certain reasons spelled out if the person has crimes of moral turpitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| or otherwise unfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I wonder if we couldn't add a little sentence or something to that that says, under subpart B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| in such case the chief shall note the reasons for the rejection on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| The reason I say that is there's a provision for judicial review on appeals on 16-210 on the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| It would be healthy, I think, as a practice to note the reasons for the denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| so that review would be based on a record that you made at the time as opposed to later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| And so I would suggest that we add the words at the very end of B to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| in such case the chief shall note the reasons for the rejection on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| I think that's healthy as a matter of administrative law, so I think it would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| Is that okay, Mr. Mills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| You're the draftsman, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| If that's the will of council, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| I'd make it a motion that we add that sentence to the tail end of section 16-208B that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1733)|
| 0:29:02| in such case, the chief shall note the reasons for the rejection on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| And like I said, the reason for that is to facilitate review should it come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Well, it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| As have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| And we have three people signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1760)|
| 0:29:29| I recognize former Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| If you would give us your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| This seems vaguely familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| My professional address is 23rd floor, First Tennessee Plaza here in beautiful downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| Long before I was on city council, let alone even thought about running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| I had the pleasure of representing Stand On, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| And Stand On is what has pulled me back here for the first time in, I think, of 22 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| I've been on the wagon, but I've fallen off, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| First and foremost, I'll be the only one speaking tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| We're in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| The other speakers are Stan Tidwell, who came here from Nashville today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| and Missy McGinnis, who's the local manager of all the Stand On locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| First and foremost, I want to thank KPD for talking to us, whether it's email or sitting down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| I've talked with Chief of Police Roush, Gus Pedousas, Nate Allen, Rick Fabian, and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| and had a good sit-down meeting at the safety building, which we're very appreciative of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| And most importantly, I'd like to thank Ron Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Ron was at that meeting, and he's had to endure my phone calls and emails concerning this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| trying to wordsmith this a little bit, and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Pawnbrokers are very heavily regulated entities, heavily regulated by the city, counties, and state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1848)|
| 0:30:58| And they're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| They operate under that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| The ordinance in front of you all tonight is a good ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| and it was brought forward on a good reason to address the fly-by-night gold and silver buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| that come into Equality Inn or wherever on a Saturday and Sunday or are gone by a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| Those folks do need to be addressed, and my clients fully support the laws applying equally and fairly to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| An unintended consequence, as this was originally drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| was that it was going to put some more regulations on my folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| We already comply with a lot, and the police department and law department recognize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| so we're able to address those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| There's, you know, particular parts that in the revisions that you all were handed tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| that we are most definitely fully supportive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| And, you know, my clients are asking me to seek one more clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| which I've discussed with Deputy Law Director Mills on 16-184-B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| Part A specifically applies to dealers and pawn shops, and this is talking about the record of transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1924)|
| 0:32:14| Part B applies only to dealers, and it omits the application to pawn shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| And as a belt and suspenders approach, my folks are just wanting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| to state on the record that it's our understanding that Part B of Section 184 does not apply to pawn shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1946)|
| 0:32:36| And, you know, with that understanding, we are fully supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| And like I said, you know, Mr. Tidwell and Ms. McGinnis won't be necessary to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| Is that a reasonable interpretation, Mr. Mills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| As drafted, yes, that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Maybe it will be another 22 months before I'm back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| But in all jest, it's good to be in front of so many friends and acquaintances in this setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| I think we need to vote as amended, on the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| We have moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| I think it's been we already have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| So all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| As have it, so order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Twelve E is an ordinance amending Chapter 19, Article 7, Section 19-187 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| to add a new subsection relative to smoking on or near hospital grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| and to remove certain exceptions superseded by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| As have it, so order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Twelve F is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 2, Article 6, Section 2-17A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| regarding the threshold for requiring bid bonds in order to enhance the capability of small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| to bid on city of Knoxville projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Councilman Dela Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Yes, I don't know if Mr. York is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I know Mr. Martin is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Can someone simply, Mr. York is here, address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| I don't understand the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| I guess Mr. Boyce Evans is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| The intent is to make it, what, easier for small businesses to submit a bid application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| The city itself will be protected if someone is awarded a contract by the contract performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| and payment bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Is my understanding correct in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Boyce Evans, purchasing agent for the city of Knoxville, 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Yes, sir, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| This is we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| Go ahead and expound on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Just tell us what we're doing because we've been struggling with helping small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| And this does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| I ran the numbers on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| And over the past two years, if you look at FY10 and FY11, all manner of construction projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2101)|
| 0:35:11| we probably led about 80 different ones, some of them very, very small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| some of them multimillion dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| And out of those, about 12 of them fall into that category of between 25K and 100K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| This would help those folks, which are usually the smaller businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| by they wouldn't have to come up basically with a, I don't know, call it a down payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| but a bond cash or check, whatever, for 5% of the total cost of what they were submitting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| And when you're a small business, you know, cash flow is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| So this would help them not have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| And frankly, the city is not at really any risk there other than an aggravation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| because the purpose of the bid bond is essentially to make sure they go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| with signing all the subsequent documentation, making sure they've got their insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| I mean, if they blow it, we just move on to the next most responsive responsible bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| The performance and payment bonds that you spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| for the person that actually executes the contract with us, signs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| those still stay in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| We have a requirement to have a payment bond for 100% of the cost of the bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| if it's over a $25,000 contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| And we also have to have a performance bond for that as well at 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| And that makes sure, from the city's standpoint, that the job gets done under the performance bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| if the contractor doesn't and the suppliers get paid under the payment bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| Isn't that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| If you blow it and do a bad job or walk off or whatever, we can pull the performance bond on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| and get the surety company to make it right through whatever means they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| If you don't pay your subcontractors, which does occasionally happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| we call in the payment bond and the surety company makes sure that the prime contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| that was defaulting on it goes through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Thank you very much, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Thank you, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Been moved and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2246)|

| 0:38:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| To the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| I called Mr. Walsh and gave him some suggestions about the Morningside Park development, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| I asked him if they could put in a swing set and a slide and a fountain for the kids and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| a fence around it, and I didn't tell him about the bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| And then Mr. King's assistant, John, he called me saying that they are looking into the pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| signs on Kingston Pike and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| Last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Can we put some crosswalk signs on Clinton Highway in the near future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Because a lot of people take public transportation, and it's very hard to get across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| because all you have is a traffic light, and these cars fly down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| I mean, Clinton Highway, we're talking as far as the Walmart down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| I mean, we're talking fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| We're not talking like you're 20, 30 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| We're talking fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| And then let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| So I work on Paper Mill as far as Wisecarver Road on the right-hand side sometime in probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| the next two to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| And a woman I talked to today, she was almost hit on Mountainville and Gleason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2391)|
| 0:40:01| She almost got hit 50 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| So she wanted to ask City Council if it's possible we can put a sidewalk over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| She asked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| I didn't get her name or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| I'd like to thank the City Council for listening to me and for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| And I'd like to thank Ms. Roddy also, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| I'm sorry, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| I keep forgetting to say Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| But I really appreciate you all listening to me, and I hope my suggestions and my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| really have an impact on the city and for the safety of the citizens of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2437)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| And after the meeting, you can talk with Mr. Steve King, who is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| He can help address some of the issues that you raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| Seeing no further business to come before us, we will now adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2458)|
| 0:41:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111101?start=2477)|
