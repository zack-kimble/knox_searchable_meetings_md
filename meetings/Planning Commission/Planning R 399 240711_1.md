| 2:08:43| If we're gonna define things with building codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| to say that we have a separate building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| it's one footprint with the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| being a point of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| How is this in two, three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| if the restaurant isn't working particularly well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| that we move retail into that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| or remove that point of sale system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| because it's all going to the same place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| What actually distinguishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| these two different establishments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| Would two separate business licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| would that define it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| I think they would have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| two separate business licenses, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| Typically what we see is the strip centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| the markets at Choteau is a good example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| where you have a larger building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| with three different tenants in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| You have a wine bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| a wing place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| and then you have a pizza place in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| So that's typically how we see these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| Chairman Hill, I have a minute and 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Can I address a couple of these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| Thank you, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| Going back to, Mr. Geale, very nice to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| I'm very glad you're on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| Nice to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| I mean, they can't operate as separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| I mean, and if the Callaway's Kitchen doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| then a McDonald's or a Petro's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| or something else could go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| So they are intended to be able to function separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| so they can be separate commercial businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| with separate business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| With regard to the pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| there have been four CN zone gas stations approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| Concord, this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| there's 15,482 trips on Concord Road a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| They invested $20 million to expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| Farragut just announced they're putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| a red light at Loop Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| So the context of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| has to take into context that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| and that traffic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| But you compare that to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| In 2022 on Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| there was another CN zone approved with eight pumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| and it had this very similar layout as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| Rutledge Pike in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| there were, and Shod Road has 2,866 as of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| And so the traffic's a lot lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| Rutledge Pike was their CN zone gas station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| was approved in 2021 with five pumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| and there's 10,000 trips on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| And Choteau, as we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| does have eight pumps, 16 points of sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| and the average daily traffic on that's 13,910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| So the traffic that serves the neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| has to be looked at in context as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| And so if you're trying to look at apples and apples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| that's the closest comparison we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| Last year, Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| Yeah, this is for Mr. Mullins again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| There's been a lot of talk about markets at Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| and I can speak to that in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| but do you know of any other examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| where in neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| that the buildings are larger than 5,000 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| The example I gave on Shod Road and Johnson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| that was approved in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| it was approved very similar layout to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| with the firewall separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| and there being a drive-through on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| and retail on the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| both being less than 5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| but the total combined building being 5,000 square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| greater than 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| Okay, and you may have already covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| I apologize, I'm trying to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| You know, I guess the part that I struggle with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| you know, we were talking about commercial CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| there's CA zoning next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| This is neighborhood commercial, it was applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| would you say 2000 and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| 2004, we didn't apply for it as the owner at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| Yeah, so 20 years ago, there was an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| I guess, you know, to go to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| That was before, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| there was a neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| But I do think the neighborhood commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| was crafted to be closer to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7954)|
| 2:12:39| I mean, they looked at the CA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| and said it's too loose, it's too aggressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| it allows too much to be, to abut another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| or abut a residential setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| That's why it was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| And I'm going by memory, so Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| you might have to jump in here and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| but they added things like, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| you can have commercial use in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| and have uses on a view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| yet you cannot let more than one half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| of one foot candle of light leave the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| So everything has to be directed back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| all has to be down lighting, aimed back at the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| They require heavy landscape screens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| where CA doesn't require either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| Sign restrictions, I believe it requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| ground-mounted signs versus pole signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| that would be allowed in a regular general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| No backlit signs, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| which lean it more towards a neighborhood feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| That's the struggle, because I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| the zone itself was designed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| It's 100% designed to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| But I realize also still it's a challenge for the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| because it is a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| So speaking, circling back around to Markets at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| some of you may know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| but I actually developed Markets at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| so I'm very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| There is a Weigel's in that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| that has eight pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| that has two services on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| so it's a total of 16 services for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| Again, struggling, somebody was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| yeah, there was a $20 million road just built, widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| There's certainly not a four-lane highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| out in the Choteau area, which we all wish there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| because there's so much development going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| So, and I understand where, Mike, you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| down on Harvey Road, the small gas station down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| it has less pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| I would lean more towards the Choteau example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| personally, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| But yeah, again, I'm just trying to continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| As far as 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| yes, some of those buildings do exceed 5,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| They get up to closer to six in examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| but they do exceed the 5,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| I think this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| I think this property is complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| by the fact that Concord Road has become such a big road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| but I need to look at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| that specifically zoned Neighborhood Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| and this is a use and review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| and when I look at a use and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| I look at whether it's compatible with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| and this morning, there was 103 comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| and I know not all of them were against this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| but the vast majority of them were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| When I look at what, under Neighborhood Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| has to come before us as a body for use and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| this isn't just one intensive use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| that's being asked of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| It's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8166)|
| 2:16:06| It's the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| It's the drive-through, and it's the fueling stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| That's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| It's also a much larger footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| than what's commonly seen in Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| I also look at the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| and I see that there's 14 variances on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| and it makes me feel like we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| to make something work that's really more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| for CA, like Commissioner Adams said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| and I will not be supporting this, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| Sorry, this discussion about the four areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| just gettin' me down a rabbit hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| and so I have a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| Four area in the zoning code related to CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8215)|
| 2:17:02| four area is not defined in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| So do we default to floor area as defined by the IBC building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8224)|
| 2:17:10| code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| I would defer to Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| But my way I would look at it would be all four walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| but whatever is in interior of the walls of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| Yes, I think we would go to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| code for the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8247)|
| 2:17:27| I guess I would qualify that just a hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8247)|
| 2:17:36| There are some instances we look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| outside of the building that are also cumulative to the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8258)|
| 2:17:43| And I think this is kind of a conversation we haven't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| had yet about the gas part being a cumulative piece of a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8265)|
| 2:17:53| For instance, if a restaurant has a patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| we would look at that patio as further of their floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| Because you could have a small indoor restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| but you could have a giant patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| And all of a sudden, that use is totally different and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| intense than it was intended to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| So we'd look at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| I mean, if you look at the cumulative effect of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| was being proposed, that's where I think from a staff standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| we're really struggling that this cumulative aspect is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8301)|
| 2:18:28| getting beyond what a typical neighborhood-oriented use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| And the whole point of that, we don't have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8314)|
| 2:18:39| Zoning code doesn't say how many limit the number of gas pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| But at the same time, it doesn't limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| I mean, they could come in with a 15-pump gas station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| and be like, well, you can't tell us no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| Well, it's obviously not appropriate in the CN zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| So I would think that we would say no to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| So there is definitely an idea of a limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| to what the CN should have in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| You guys referenced the Weigels a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| Does it have a drive-through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| I think it's a point well made there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| about a cumulative effect there, Mr. Reynolds, of all the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8359)|
| 2:19:28| OK, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| My question, the next part of my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| is now a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| If we are defaulting to the building code definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| and I think in a way we are if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| saying that the firewall then separates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| is our separator here, the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| definition of floor area gross is not only the measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8393)|
| 2:20:00| from the exterior face of the walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| but it also includes the usable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| under horizontal extensions of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| So by that definition, and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| may look at the occupancy of this differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| so correct me if I'm wrong, but by that definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| I think we would have to count the canopy as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| of the floor area here, which puts us well over 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| square feet regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| So I guess, county, from a plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8436)|
| 2:20:46| would you recognize the usable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8446)|
| 2:20:54| under a horizontal projection as part of the square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| calculation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| I think for floor area, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| Because floor area, patios and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| would go towards your requirement for restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| But I think in this case, it specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| says building size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| So I don't think floor area, patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| it's not enclosed by three walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| wouldn't be included in building size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| So does that make sense to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| But I think the CN restriction is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| I think it says building, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| It's not floor area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| No, it says floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| It does say floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| So I guess from a legal standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| if we are to approve something that is technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| over 5,000 square feet, I guess maybe that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| something that a court would have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| But I'm curious if we can even allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| If we're following this set of rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| the definitions under the IBC, then yeah, where are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8520)|
| 2:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| I would defer to the county on that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| And also, I understand your question, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| But as I look at the rendering here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| the canopy is not connected to the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| It doesn't appear to be part of that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| It's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8551)|
| 2:22:32| And so the county is going to have a definition of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| they interpret that under their codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| more than we would as planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| Yeah, and I had a similar thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| with it being detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| So that gets back to the other part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| of this conversation of do we count the sum of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| or detached buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| And part of my line of thinking here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| is with it being detached, to follow the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8580)|
| 2:23:07| we may actually need to be, if we can allow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| then we would, I think, need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| that it is under 5,000 square feet as a canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| because it's a separate structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| And with that, I don't know the square footage of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| as it stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| I could scale it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| But based off the fact that the building is 7,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8608)|
| 2:23:31| I would assume that the canopy is well over 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| So I think that we would end up needing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| to limit the number of pumps anyways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| if we're following the 5,000 square foot rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8624)|
| 2:23:48| I'm sorry if that is a lot of different threads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| I can further explain my thinking if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| I think that amidst this mess, confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| I'm going to let Councilor Mullins and Councilor Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| A couple of minutes for each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| I know Mr. Sanders has been standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| behind me for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| I'll let him speak and then I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| So to this issue about building size versus establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8655)|
| 2:24:25| size, it says building or commercial establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| You can't have a building over 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| You can't have a commercial establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| over 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| The zoning code contains its own definition of building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| It is not appropriate here because the zoning code does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| not mention the building code in the first instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| It's not appropriate to go outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| for a definition of building when the zoning code contains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| its own definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| And that definition is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| Any structure built for the support, shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| enclosure of persons, animals, movable possessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| or property of any kind which has a roof and enclosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| walls for at least 50% of its perimeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| the term building shall be as if followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| by the words or part thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8714)|
| 2:25:21| The definition here does not mention firewalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8721)|
| 2:25:27| The purpose of firewalls under the building code, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| I don't even think you have the definitions from the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| code in front of you to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| what technical application they might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| I'm saying they don't have any application to the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| code because it has its own definition of building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| And that definition includes a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| with a roof and exterior walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| This is a structure with a roof and exterior walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| that exceeds 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| And if we're going to go on the other side of the oar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| and we're going to talk about commercial establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| I take your point, your points well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| Even if we consider the gas station and the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| as two commercial establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| the gas station plus the canopy far exceeds 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8779)|
| 2:26:26| But it's either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| It's not either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| You've got a building here that's more than 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8792)|
| 2:26:32| You can't approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| It is a violation of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| Again, you have no limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| If you follow this road, you can just keep adding firewalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8800)|
| 2:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8808)|
| 2:26:48| Again, I'll go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| The definition of building in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| does not prohibit attached buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| There are two separate buildings here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| with four walls and a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| They just are attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| So I don't think it is, based on plain language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| a violation of what the zoning ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| But the fact that we are all debating this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| lends itself to the argument there is some ambiguity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| And what the law tells us, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| an ambiguity in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| then it inerts to the benefit of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| for the free use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| I'm glad that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| The canopy does have a roof, but it doesn't have four walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| So it would not fit within that at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| if you're looking at the definition of zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| because it's not attached to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| and it does not have four walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| And it doesn't have any walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| It has posts and a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| But I do want to go back in the minute I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| You mentioned about the archaeological study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| I don't think that that is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| The only issue I have, you look at the landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| and we have a lot there that we do not want to disturb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| I think the neighbors don't want us to disturb that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| There might be some grading that we'll have to replant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| but I wouldn't want to do any ground scraping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| in an area with mature trees to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| that type of archaeological study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| So if you are inclined to some type of condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| the areas that we intend to grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| I think that would be appropriate to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| But the areas that are supposed to be left undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| might not be appropriate for that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| So I just wanted to add that caveat to your thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| on that, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| Yeah, I'll just make a big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| Just a question on the canopy, kind of its definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8909)|
| 2:28:33| as building, or I'm curious if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| were to think about this as a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| with an outdoor dining pavilion that's open air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| and it's covered, would that count towards square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| as part of the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| It would count towards floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| Yes, and I've actually text my plans reviewers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| and gas pumps would not be included as floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| So they wouldn't count as part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| OK, and I guess maybe I'm just struggling to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| what's the difference between an outdoor dining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| pavilion that has a roof but no walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8942)|
| 2:29:03| and a canopy that has a roof but no walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| Why is one floor area and one's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| So a patio with just a canopy over it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| isn't considered a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8952)|
| 2:29:13| It doesn't have three walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| A building, by definition, the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| has to have three walls and a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| So if it's an open air canopy, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| would be part of the floor area, not part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| If it's enclosed, it would be part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| It would be square footage of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| OK, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| But in either of these analogies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| I guess the open air place is part of floor area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| but not part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8973)|
| 2:29:34| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| And sorry, just for my, because I'm getting confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| Are we talking about floor area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| Or is floor area not the relevant measure here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8982)|
| 2:29:47| I guess question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| Well, floor established, it does talk about business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| establishment, like floor area as well, and not just structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| And I think that's where the hard part with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| it's easy with a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| It's like, OK, patio, restaurant, extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| We haven't typically thought about the gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| pumps in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9011)|
| 2:30:12| But I mean, logically speaking, the more gas pumps you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| the bigger convenience store you're going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| And all these things kind of accumulately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| lead to something larger and larger and larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| and pushing the envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| I guess just in my mind, too, the area under a gas canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| is used to generate revenue for the business that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| part of the operating business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| And so I see that as kind of akin to an outdoor dining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| pavilion, which is also area used to generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| revenue for the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| So in my mind, they're similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| Vice Chair Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| Just a quick comment on that, because there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| it's interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| For the Weigels in Choteau, his building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| is somewhere around 5,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| And I'm sure that gas canopy out front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| is every bit as large as that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| But again, I don't know that that, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| talking about intent of neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| It's like, what we're talking about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| if we did view it that way, is you either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| wouldn't be able to have a gas canopy at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| because you've got a 5,000-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| You either wouldn't be able to have a gas canopy at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| because you've got a 5,000-square-foot convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| store, and you can't have any gas canopy at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| Or you have a gas canopy in no store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| because together, per this line of thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| together they're over 5,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| So I guess that's kind of a confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| I don't think the intent was to say you can't have a gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| canopy or that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| Back to codes again real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| And this is a long time ago, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| could have changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| But we talked about the floor area not exceeding 5,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| Is a hallway considered floor area, or a broom closet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9116)|
| 2:32:01| Is that considered floor area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| I think we look at it more as building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| what's within the four walls of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| I think that interpretation may have changed a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| since 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| That's the interpretation of the codes department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| that this has no building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| So we say the building can't exceed 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9144)|
| 2:32:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| And in the zoning ordinance, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| some nuance, too, on how we look at floor area for retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9146)|
| 2:32:31| Parking for retail stores, it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| one space per 100 square feet of retail floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| And so in that case, we're looking at what's the retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| floor area, not the whole floor area of the entire business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| because we don't even look at the stock area and bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9165)|
| 2:32:45| That's really what I was referring to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| And I just wanted to say, so I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| we did, I guess Commissioner Higgins kind of mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| what size is this canopy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9176)|
| 2:32:58| I did just an area calculation of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9178)|
| 2:33:03| and it appeared to be about 4,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| somewhere around there, if I was semi-accurate with my mouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9186)|
| 2:33:14| And it went down to four pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| It would be about 2,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| So that gives you some leftover space for a retail establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| Yeah, I think what Commissioner Huger was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9205)|
| 2:33:28| about if you started considering the canopies and gas pump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9208)|
| 2:33:35| areas, that that would mean that you couldn't have those at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| that you would always be going over that 5,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| I think that is actually the logic to definitely include it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| because that means that you would be making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| that whatever kind of fueling establishment or mini market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9229)|
| 2:33:54| that sort of thing, was small enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| that it did not oversize the community that it was going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| So I think that actually really does support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| that intent of the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| is getting it down to that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9246)|
| 2:34:14| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| I'll just respond to Mr. Mullen's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| I agree with the potential for unmarked graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| I don't think it makes sense for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| to get into area that you don't plan on disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| But I do think that we should add a condition for area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| that is getting disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| I agree with staff, at least on the canopy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| I understand that it is all very vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| But I do think that the intent here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9285)|
| 2:34:51| is to create limitations of scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| and especially since it says both size, or building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| size, or business size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9301)|
| 2:35:05| I don't have the exact wording pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| But point being, the canopy is part of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9306)|
| 2:35:10| I don't really want to get into the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9310)|
| 2:35:15| like that just seems like a sticky situation of trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| to argue the square footage of the canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| and how that contributes, or if it contributes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| And it sounds like county has an established perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| But I do think that it would be appropriate to limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| the number of pumps to four or five here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9333)|
| 2:35:37| and just take off a few, and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| to scale it down a little bit more for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| Or put this on pause, and rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| and come back with a different zoning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| doesn't have the same limitations to it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9350)|
| 2:35:56| Are you going to do one of those, a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| Well, I will make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9360)|
| 2:36:01| Yeah, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| I'm scared, because this is a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| But let me pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| Well, actually, I'll make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| to approve for staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| and adding a condition that, as Mr. Reynolds said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9377)|
| 2:36:27| about the archeological research for the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| for unmarked graves, that that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| be performed in the areas that they plan on disturbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9395)|
| 2:36:41| and not the undisturbed areas as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9401)|
| 2:36:48| I don't think it's appropriate for the full site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| but just the area that it's expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| to have unmarked graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| What agency has purview over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| Is that local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| Or is it run up to state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| I'm not sure, but I believe it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9425)|
| 2:37:06| be someone from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| I just want to make sure that there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| some large-scale grading that leads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| to something getting missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9437)|
| 2:37:21| And it seems like there's a way to do that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| kind of minimally invasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| So that's my intent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| But I am definitely open to friendly amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| to my motion, because I'm not really changing too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| from staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9459)|
| 2:37:44| I was just going to ask, are there any conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| I know Councilor Mullins had suggested edits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| to some of staff's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| Yeah, there were four requests from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| And if you all want to discuss, you're welcome to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| In the meantime, I'm going to go to Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| Yeah, so I had a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| And going back to the kind of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| on the canopies, so one of the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| allowed uses in CN would be, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| like an outpatient medical clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| If they had a canopy in front of their entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9495)|
| 2:38:18| to allow patients to pull under to get out of the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| would that ever be included in the square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| of a building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| I believe that would be considered an accessory use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| to the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9509)|
| 2:38:34| OK, we still have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| And we can either let the motion die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| or we can talk about it and have some friendly amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9520)|
| 2:38:46| I'm open to suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| I was going to throw out a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9530)|
| 2:38:51| OK, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| And that is to approve, per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| with one added condition be a total of 15 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9542)|
| 2:39:03| All right, and that, would you please repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| that one added condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9545)|
| 2:39:10| Don't want to, but that's the applicant would undergo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9550)|
| 2:39:20| I can at least try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| Are we talking about a phase one archaeological study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| or are you talking about just ground penetrating radar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| I want to understand what we're asking, the scope of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| Because when you get into the area of archaeological studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9572)|
| 2:39:36| there's a lot of nuance to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| So the intent is to go to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9580)|
| 2:39:46| where we find whether using reasonable steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| to determine if there are graves there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| And not going and doing a full archaeological dig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9592)|
| 2:39:58| I mean, that's not the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9598)|
| 2:40:00| Obviously, if graves are found, then things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| grind to a halt, and there's processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| to what the next steps are beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9604)|
| 2:40:07| Either leave things as is, or if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| want to attempt to do something with those graves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| there's a whole process there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| So I think that's the intent, is to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| if there's not anything identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| through this more simple process than is assumed to be OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9618)|
| 2:40:23| You're not mandating any specific types of testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| just so that we do something reasonable to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| there's no graves at that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| I think, and this is based on the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| of that previous case I dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| that when the ground penetrating radar did not find anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| and they were looking at a very specific location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| and they weren't doing a full thing about the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| the next thing that they recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9650)|
| 2:40:51| was the grading and stripping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| Just the top few inches of soil off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| then they can determine, they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| look at the compilation of the soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| and make a relatively decent determination of whether there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9662)|
| 2:41:06| was graves there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| And that was the basis of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| of the archaeologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| So I think that's what we would expect here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| What's your recommendation to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| I think just the surface stripping with a consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| guided by a consultant, would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9685)|
| 2:41:30| I definitely don't think it needs to be a huge ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| It's just one of those things that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| a difference between let's check first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| and if something shows up, we call the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9699)|
| 2:41:45| So I think that having a consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| take part in initial grading with that would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9709)|
| 2:42:00| I think I understand what they're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9722)|
| 2:42:03| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9723)|
| 2:42:04| Do you mean like a specialist, some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9724)|
| 2:42:07| of archaeological specialist who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| standing alongside to make sure that this is handled correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| Yeah, kind of like Mike was describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| where they took the first few layers of soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| with just someone, I think an expert present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| who could identify what it would look like if there was a grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9743)|
| 2:42:31| And I think going back to what Mr. Reynolds said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| I'm involved in some historic property in Hamblin County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| where we are doing different types of archaeological studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| in relation to an expansion of a landfill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9762)|
| 2:42:42| So I think the first step is do ground-panel training radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9762)|
| 2:42:46| And if something looks like it needs more study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9766)|
| 2:42:51| then you can take the second step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| And I think that's more kind of what they looked at there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| They had the ground-panel training radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9775)|
| 2:42:56| and they wanted to go a step further just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| Yeah, because that was for a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| And there was a road that was relative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| And it was a situation where there was an existing cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9784)|
| 2:43:10| which is obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| And then there was a historic church on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9792)|
| 2:43:16| that was no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9796)|
| 2:43:17| And there was documentation that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| may have been additional grave sites into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| So basically, they did the ground-panel training radar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9802)|
| 2:43:25| around the existing cemetery, what they knew existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| They didn't find anything outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| And then they knew where the roads were going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| where it wanted the roads to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| And so they scraped the roads, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| And then, since they were going to upgrade that anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| so they went ahead and scraped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| I don't think they ever got to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| They didn't develop the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| But that was the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| Scrape there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| So basically, in this case, it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| you know you want to leave some trees, anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9831)|
| 2:43:57| that you're not maintaining, especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| like, I don't know, the first 50 feet or 100 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| whatever it might be, outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| Go ahead and do the scraping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| That would become my initial thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| See if there's anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| I think that's what my expectation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9850)|
| 2:44:14| But I'm not an expert, so I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| And there's documentation that I haven't seen outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| of what the community member has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| Mr. Yoder, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| I would definitely want the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| of an archaeologist on how to proceed through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| And we can do that, especially in the areas where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| I mean, maybe not the, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| if you do the entire site or half of it that's next to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| you know, to the area where the cemetery is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| Because you can see where we'd be grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| you know, for the building in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| down to its entrance with Second Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| I mean, that's, you know, the further you get away from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| I think the less likely you are to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| into something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| That's why I wanted to specifically say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| with a consultant is I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| to require the whole site to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9907)|
| 2:45:10| I think just whatever an industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| standard for a situation like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| when it's suspected that there might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| there's a high likelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| We will hire a consultant and let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| him inform us what they recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| you know, the most likely areas of where the graves may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| and do appropriate testing at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| Let me abbreviate this for just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| because Director Brooks has been doing some research here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| So maybe we have a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9934)|
| 2:45:34| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9935)|
| 2:45:36| So what about something to this effect of a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| that a preliminary archaeological survey, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| could include ground penetrating radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| review of relevant archives, and other physical investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| would take place before development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9946)|
| 2:45:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9952)|
| 2:45:52| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| I just wanted to say thank you for the floor of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| are there friendly amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9959)|
| 2:46:00| I'll accept those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| And so I immediately started thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| how could I amend this and be OK with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| but I keep getting hung up on the overall size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| But if there was some way to modify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| then I could start going down the road of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| to make this fit from a design standpoint in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| of the area that it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| But I keep getting hung up on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| So I just wanted to explain I appreciated that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| Commissioner Adams, I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| But I feel somewhat confined to the interpretation of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9991)|
| 2:46:37| I mean, we can argue intent all we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| but until we change the code, can we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| do anything about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10003)|
| 2:46:46| I mean, the code says 5,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| Yeah, but then they say 5,000 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| is defined with the separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10011)|
| 2:46:56| With the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| That's the part I'm referring to our staff over here, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10018)|
| 2:47:04| They have a different interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| So I guess whichever interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| you want to rely on, I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| I hear that that has been a, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| trying to use this in the pejorative, so understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10035)|
| 2:47:18| that that has been a way to work around parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10038)|
| 2:47:22| in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| I'm not saying that in a pejorative way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| But I do not believe, when I think about neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| commercial, and I think of examples in my mind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| totally fit that, that do include fuel stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10053)|
| 2:47:38| they are not this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| And I think that there are many indicators in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10059)|
| 2:47:42| of the plan that we have in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| and other examples, and the fact that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| spent this long debating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| Like, there is a definite sense of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| that neighborhood commercial is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| It's human scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10075)|
| 2:47:56| It's not car scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| And that we have engineered a scenario now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| that is pushing us towards that big box footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| and the car scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| And I don't think that's what we're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| Chairman Hill, on that matter, if I could make a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10092)|
| 2:48:16| that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| So in looking at the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| for neighborhood commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| there is some guidance in the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| here that I want to point out to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| I'm looking at 5.38.04, which says building size regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| A says, no building shall exceed 35 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10117)|
| 2:48:43| So that's the clear language, no building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10123)|
| 2:48:46| B, no individual building or commercial establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10126)|
| 2:48:52| shall have a floor area exceeding 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| I would suggest that we look at the language that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| provided to us here for some kind of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10140)|
| 2:49:04| because while commercial establishment is not specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10144)|
| 2:49:10| defined for us, there is a distinction here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10150)|
| 2:49:13| in referencing a building with relation to height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10153)|
| 2:49:18| And then in the second component for regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10158)|
| 2:49:22| no individual building or commercial establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| shall have a floor area exceeding 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10165)|
| 2:49:31| So I bring that to your attention to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| that it provides clarification or further confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| Well, I'm completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10178)|
| 2:49:41| The way I interpreted from our building department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10181)|
| 2:49:44| was the wall defined the square footage of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10184)|
| 2:49:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10192)|
| 2:49:53| And I'm not saying it's right, it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| But in the past, it's been interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| that when a firewall, by building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10197)|
| 2:50:00| when you put in a firewall, it constitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| two separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10202)|
| 2:50:03| So in theory, if there's a firewall there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10203)|
| 2:50:06| that separates the two buildings, the two areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10206)|
| 2:50:10| then it is two separate buildings by definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| of the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| I'm not saying that's right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| I'm just telling you that's the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| it's been interpreted in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| We're trying to find somebody to rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| Is that what counsel was saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| She read the line, but I think like you, Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| I'm still trying to figure out exactly what she was implying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10228)|
| 2:50:34| According to our building department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10234)|
| 2:50:37| they're stating that the firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10237)|
| 2:50:41| has separated to where we don't have a building that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| exceeds 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10244)|
| 2:50:46| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| That's their interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10248)|
| 2:50:49| Their counsel's interpretation is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| So it's up to us to determine what you want to rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| There is a definition in the zoning code of the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10255)|
| 2:51:04| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| It is any structure built for the support, shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| or enclosure of persons, animals, movable possessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| or property of any kind which has a roof and enclosing walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| for at least 50% of its perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| Which has a roof and enclosing walls for at least 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| of its perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| The term building shall be as if followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| by the words or part thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| For the purpose of area and height limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| this definition shall be applicable to sheds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| and open sheds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| Open sheds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| Now, listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| There's your clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| They've got another remedy upstream here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10310)|
| 2:51:51| So let's vote with the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| that we have to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| And I hope we get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| If we don't, they have a remedy to send it on upstream to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| Chair, I want to add a couple things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10325)|
| 2:52:08| per the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10328)|
| 2:52:11| I think that the condition with the operating hours to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10331)|
| 2:52:18| modify my motion so that number 10 includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| allows them to open at 5 AM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| And then there was a question about condition six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10346)|
| 2:52:34| And I think that we haven't discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| And I don't know if that really needs to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| I think maybe a better scenario there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10361)|
| 2:52:44| would be to say that they can work that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| with the county's transportation department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| whether or not to have the left turn there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| Let's let them weigh in on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| Item number six about the right turns only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10379)|
| 2:53:02| using a curved island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| Thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10384)|
| 2:53:10| I mean, like I said, we don't have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| with addressing that through signage or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| striping on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10394)|
| 2:53:15| The island, we're concerned about turn radiuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| especially if you have vehicles coming in with boats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10398)|
| 2:53:20| and hitting that curb and causing damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| And so that raised island is what we are concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10403)|
| 2:53:26| not about restricting or discouraging left turns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10406)|
| 2:53:30| into their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10410)|
| 2:53:31| We don't anticipate, unless they're coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| have a reason to be in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| there's any reason for them to go back there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| But the raised island is a safety issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| was our concern on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10419)|
| 2:53:40| With the turn radius coming off of Second Drive, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| is fairly narrow, even with the widening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| that would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10425)|
| 2:53:46| Can we just maybe defer to engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| on that at the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| So does that work for you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| So we're going to leave that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| And if you guys deem it necessary, you'll put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10441)|
| 2:54:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10447)|
| 2:54:07| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| And finally, the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| I just want to clarify with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| Is 15-foot the typical maximum height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10457)|
| 2:54:25| When lighting is adjacent to residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| it's unusual to see a 15-foot maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10467)|
| 2:54:33| It really ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| It could be 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| Just depends on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| The further the light fixture is physically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| away from a residential prop round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10479)|
| 2:54:44| or any other sensitive type use, usually the greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10484)|
| 2:54:48| the height can be and still be OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| The hard part is shielding or masking the light fixture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| the actual light source itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| So the taller it gets, the harder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10497)|
| 2:54:59| it is to hide that light source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10499)|
| 2:55:02| An applicant has mentioned having shields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| on the backsides of some lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| If it said that in the photometric plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10508)|
| 2:55:11| I didn't notice it or realize it when it was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| I didn't look back to see how it was stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| Sometimes it's just like codes associated with light fixtures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| It's going to have a string of five different coded letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10521)|
| 2:55:26| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| I'm not sure what it all means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| So maybe that meant a shield in there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| Shielding is definitely a way to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| I just didn't really see where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| was going to be located when I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10537)|
| 2:55:40| looking at the photometric plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| Would it be appropriate to say, keep the 15 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10543)|
| 2:55:48| but allow for alternative heights with proper shielding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10548)|
| 2:55:57| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| I mean, the concern with the 15 feet is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10558)|
| 2:55:59| Again, vehicles hitting any larger vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| And we've seen that in other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| where you've had a commercial establishment with a 15 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10564)|
| 2:56:07| luminary hitting the light fixture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| But we do intend to shield them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| And our photometric's based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10573)|
| 2:56:14| Again, there's all kinds of codes in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| But if you want to put the condition 15 feet or higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| if shielded, that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| As long as the light transfer is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10582)|
| 2:56:25| with our photometric, which is showing 0.1 to 0.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| I just want to make sure that the condition provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10591)|
| 2:56:34| clear guidance for enforcement purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| So would a photometric measuring after installation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10597)|
| 2:56:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10604)|
| 2:56:45| I'm looking at Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| I mean, I think the shielding is a little ambiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| because what is shielding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10612)|
| 2:56:53| So I prefer something more static for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| to enforce, requiring a photometric analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| at the end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| I'm OK with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| Or the 15 feet pose, I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| But this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| Isn't there specific shielding advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| given for other structures that talk about the downward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10628)|
| 2:57:14| Would that be adequate in terms of helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| with the enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| I guess I would say I'm not terribly comfortable with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| We don't have anything specifically in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| to say, well, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| And what are we going to be measuring at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10647)|
| 2:57:30| Is it fair to say that it wouldn't exceed the photometrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10650)|
| 2:57:35| of the 15 foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| Whatever it displays or casts, I don't know the language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10657)|
| 2:57:42| And it's really if the neighbors are downhill from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10662)|
| 2:57:45| and looking up into the light, that creates a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| So without seeing a plan, I'm with Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| it's hard for me to look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| I think a more static number is easier for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10672)|
| 2:57:55| to enforce than can be higher if we're shielded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| Well, what's the maximum height if it's shielded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10678)|
| 2:58:04| Well, our photometrics have no more than 0.2 foot candles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10684)|
| 2:58:08| at the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| And as long as we can achieve that, then again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10690)|
| 2:58:13| the height is just a concern with safety with vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| I think my problem with that is we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10696)|
| 2:58:17| have no way of measuring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10697)|
| 2:58:18| So the onus would be on you guys to measure that and provide us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10698)|
| 2:58:22| with something at the end saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| it met the photometric plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10704)|
| 2:58:27| Mr. Reynolds, do you have any concern about 15 feet being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10707)|
| 2:58:32| I guess, trucks hitting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| I'd have to defer, I guess, to their civil team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10717)|
| 2:58:42| in how close the light fixtures are to the drive aisles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10722)|
| 2:58:45| in session where the larger trucks are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| What is a typical canopy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| Is that supposed to be less than 14 feet tall, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| for larger vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| Tractor trailer, what's 13, about 13, 13.6, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10736)|
| 2:59:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10740)|
| 2:59:01| So I think that's a 15 foot light technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| should be OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10744)|
| 2:59:05| But would you get in that close on some of the larger vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| it might be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| But it's not something I deal with too often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| so I'd have to defer to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| I'm going to stay with the 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Yeah, I want to keep, let's keep that condition in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10759)|
| 2:59:22| And worst case scenario, I think that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10762)|
| 2:59:27| a good middle ground for neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| and to keep it limited to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| So we'll keep that one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| OK, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10775)|
| 2:59:36| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| OK, so item six will now be eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10778)|
| 2:59:46| but it'll be reviewed by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| If there's a need, it'll be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| OK, the item number 10 will be changed from 6 AM to 5 AM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10794)|
| 3:00:02| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10802)|
| 3:00:03| And then item 15, we've got the archaeological language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10803)|
| 3:00:11| All right, is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| All right, we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| All right, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10818)|
| 3:00:19| It's a confirmation that Mr. Biggs needs to reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10819)|
| 3:00:24| Oh, OK, OK, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| Commissioner Biggs, can you, will you amend your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10827)|
| 3:00:33| Will you second the amended version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| Yes, I second the amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| All right, we got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| Now that you got all that, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| Let's raise hands on the noes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| 1, 2, 3, 4, you got those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10854)|
| 3:01:03| Adams, Perez, Hill, and Ame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10863)|
| 3:01:11| So that makes it 9 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| So we got 4 nays, 4 nays, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| Hey, let's take a 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| All right, let's get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| We are now on to item 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| This is a similar use determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| for off-road trail riding for motorized vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10893)|
| 3:01:37| and mountain bikes in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10897)|
| 3:01:40| And I'll let Mr. Reynolds speak on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10900)|
| 3:01:54| 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10914)|
| 3:02:00| I'm sorry, I was distracted for a moment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| This is the other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| Similar use determination, item 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10926)|
| 3:02:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| So we have a process for considering similar use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10934)|
| 3:02:18| determinations, which the intent there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10938)|
| 3:02:22| is that the planning commission can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10942)|
| 3:02:25| a use that's not explicitly defined in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| ordinance and determine whether it is similar in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10948)|
| 3:02:33| to the other uses that are listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| in that particular zone that's being applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10955)|
| 3:02:38| In this case, this property or the zoning district in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10958)|
| 3:02:42| is the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| And the use is an off-road trail riding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10964)|
| 3:02:48| for motorized vehicles and mountain bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10968)|
| 3:02:52| We really don't have a use class for that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10972)|
| 3:02:56| Probably the closest thing is like auto racing facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| like a racetrack, but that's like an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10982)|
| 3:03:04| That's not really the same thing that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10986)|
| 3:03:10| If the use is proposed, like say in a commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| for instance, it probably could fit in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10993)|
| 3:03:17| but it's not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10997)|
| 3:03:18| It's not listed anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=10998)|
| 3:03:22| So as part of this process, typically the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11002)|
| 3:03:27| has to provide what their rationale is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11007)|
| 3:03:31| for why this use is similar to another use in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| code or in that particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| And what they were referring to, like sports recreational field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11019)|
| 3:03:46| something along those lines, it's kind of hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11026)|
| 3:03:53| It's not too far of a stretch, but it is a lot different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| like a baseball field versus some other sports field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11035)|
| 3:03:59| to a motorized vehicle facility, a trail facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11039)|
| 3:04:06| And there's no clear correlation to anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11046)|
| 3:04:09| that we could point to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| So what I did was looked at several different uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| within the ag zone, what kind of restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| do those uses have in them, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11059)|
| 3:04:22| makes sense to apply to a use like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11062)|
| 3:04:29| So it's kind of taking bits and pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| from different uses in the ag zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| and saying, OK, how does this use relate to their intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11074)|
| 3:04:39| and what components can we apply to this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11079)|
| 3:04:46| or this use to make it, or not necessarily make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11086)|
| 3:04:51| so that the determination could be more similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| that it is similar to uses within the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| It's kind of a hard way to go about saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| Ultimately, what I'm recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| is approval of the similar use determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11105)|
| 3:05:10| with certain operational restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11110)|
| 3:05:15| or site improvements as part of a use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11115)|
| 3:05:18| So basically saying that the recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11118)|
| 3:05:24| approval of this as a similar use within the ag zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11124)|
| 3:05:28| as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| So they would have to bring a use on review application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| back to us for consideration of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11133)|
| 3:05:36| So it's not, if the similar use is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11136)|
| 3:05:39| it doesn't automatically mean that they're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| They have to bring back a new application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| explicit business plan and operational plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11143)|
| 3:05:48| and all that kind of stuff to this body for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11148)|
| 3:05:53| There's five listed operational restrictions and site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11153)|
| 3:05:57| improvements that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| I can go through those if needed, but I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11159)|
| 3:06:06| We'll read those on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| All right, we have the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| Chairman Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11174)|
| 3:06:14| Can I ask a question about those restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| Or do I need to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11178)|
| 3:06:19| You can, but it's probably better to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| Let's let the applicant speak, and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| toss it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11184)|
| 3:06:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11185)|
| 3:06:26| All right, Mr. McGuire, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11186)|
| 3:06:31| Not unless I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11191)|
| 3:06:32| OK, you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11192)|
| 3:06:34| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11194)|
| 3:06:36| All right, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11196)|
| 3:06:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11203)|
| 3:06:48| Name and address, Mr. Murphy, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| And my sign up, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11210)|
| 3:06:55| A motorized trail riding facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| brings in equipment that's really noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11217)|
| 3:07:01| Applicant states that often, the standard stock exhaust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11221)|
| 3:07:07| is 95 to 105 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| This is very different than many of the other uses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| are allowed on residential property or agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| property in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| And this is a business that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11240)|
| 3:07:23| be authorized to operate frequently on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| Now, where you have multiple noise emitting machines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| on that property at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| This is different even than if you live next to a farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11255)|
| 3:07:40| and your farmer next to you is out doing their hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11260)|
| 3:07:44| Yeah, they'll run their tractor around for two or three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| but they'll run all over their property with one tractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| And you kind of know that too if you see a hay field next to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| that they might cut hay every once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| But if we allow uses on reviews for motorized trail riding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11277)|
| 3:08:01| facilities, that brings in a very intensive type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11281)|
| 3:08:06| of a nuisance noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11286)|
| 3:08:08| It's very difficult to mitigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| I don't even know, it's not specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11290)|
| 3:08:14| There are no noise regulations associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| with this recommendation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| And that's one of my biggest concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11299)|
| 3:08:20| Because if there aren't, then we fall back on the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| zoning or noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| And I put that in a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| If this was considered a residential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11309)|
| 3:08:32| then you're allowed to have noise at 65 decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11312)|
| 3:08:36| at your property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11316)|
| 3:08:37| Now, 65 decibels might not seem like a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11317)|
| 3:08:42| But it's between conversation and car noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11322)|
| 3:08:46| But I've kind of tried to get an idea of what that was like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| And I live on a fairly busy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| And yesterday afternoon, there was a fairly continuous stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11331)|
| 3:08:53| of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| So I went outside with a noise meter on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| It's not 100% accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| But I stood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| And the 65 decibel limit that I found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| where that was registering was about 80 or 90 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| from the edge of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11346)|
| 3:09:07| So I get 80 or 90 feet off a busy street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11347)|
| 3:09:11| And I'm at 65 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11351)|
| 3:09:12| And you definitely can hear that quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| That's if this is a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| And that's what's allowed at the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| If this is considered a commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| well, our noise ordinance allows you to go up to 80 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11362)|
| 3:09:26| 80 decibels is what I was able to get to when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| I stood a couple of feet off the pavement with cars whizzing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11368)|
| 3:09:33| by at 45 miles an hour, accelerating uphill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11373)|
| 3:09:37| from a railroad crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11377)|
| 3:09:40| You'd get to maybe 82 or 83 if it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11380)|
| 3:09:42| somebody that had loud exhaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11382)|
| 3:09:43| But that's what would be potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11383)|
| 3:09:47| permissible by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11387)|
| 3:09:50| There is no noise regulation specified in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11390)|
| 3:09:53| If you're thinking of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11393)|
| 3:09:54| I'd really ask you to go put some thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| into what some low acceptable noise limits would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11398)|
| 3:10:01| be at the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| The other thing is put the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| on the operator of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11405)|
| 3:10:08| Otherwise, you're saying, well, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| going to allow we might approve these as uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11410)|
| 3:10:13| As we just had a discussion about, use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11413)|
| 3:10:16| is really a use on right that we might have to condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| So you're saying, well, we might allow this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| And then we're going to make the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| if the adjacent property owner, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| going to have to either do one of two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| either complain to the COATS compartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11428)|
| 3:10:30| or the Sheriff's Department and file a bunch of noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11430)|
| 3:10:32| complaints and hope that that enforcement ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11432)|
| 3:10:34| So you're putting enforcement burden on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| Or your adjacent property owner has to go gather evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11437)|
| 3:10:42| pay for something that can be admissible to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11442)|
| 3:10:44| hire an attorney, and then go to court and file a nuisance suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11444)|
| 3:10:50| I don't think that most of the people living in the county that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| live in agricultural zone are expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11453)|
| 3:10:56| this kind of an intensive use to potentially show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11456)|
| 3:10:58| on the Planning Commission agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| and then come to this meeting, deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11460)|
| 3:11:04| with the use on review discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11464)|
| 3:11:06| and then potentially be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| Also, in the regulations, number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| talks about things couldn't be closer than 300 feet to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11472)|
| 3:11:15| in the list of number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| I noticed that if you have agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| open space next to it, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| one of those things that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| subject to the 300-foot limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11485)|
| 3:11:26| So that means you would allow, in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| trails to be located right next to somebody else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11491)|
| 3:11:35| Which, if they've got a motorized vehicle that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| emitting 95 decibels, that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| going to generate some noise issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11505)|
| 3:11:47| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| I had two points on my list of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11511)|
| 3:11:54| I wanted to ask about in terms of the policy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11514)|
| 3:11:58| was being created here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11518)|
| 3:11:59| And the very first one was sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11519)|
| 3:12:03| So I'm glad I'm not the only person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| that was worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| Mike, why wasn't sound included in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11527)|
| 3:12:12| And if it is, tell me where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11532)|
| 3:12:17| I didn't have a reasonable number to come to on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11537)|
| 3:12:21| And the county noise ordinance, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11541)|
| 3:12:25| was what I was defaulting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| So I guess the other question I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11549)|
| 3:12:34| before I hone in on the sound aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| is about the proximity and about the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11557)|
| 3:12:43| that this could morph from other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| So proximity first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| 300 feet is really not that far in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11569)|
| 3:12:56| of a heavy, loud, intensive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| And I understand that that might be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| because of some of the other codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| that you were pulling from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11583)|
| 3:13:04| But I'm wondering if that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11584)|
| 3:13:07| that could be expanded to make that a further distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11587)|
| 3:13:12| Yeah, I kind of hesitated to throw too many standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11592)|
| 3:13:15| in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11595)|
| 3:13:16| Being on a similar use determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11596)|
| 3:13:17| is kind of a unique way to approach this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11597)|
| 3:13:24| The hope would be that there would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| be actual standards put into the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11606)|
| 3:13:29| and developed further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| And maybe during the next process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11612)|
| 3:13:34| for the unified development ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| that might be part of that component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11616)|
| 3:13:38| But yeah, 300 feet, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11618)|
| 3:13:46| I felt that that was a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11626)|
| 3:13:50| And you could tweak that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11630)|
| 3:13:56| to say that the languishing could require more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11636)|
| 3:13:59| or even make it so that it says trail and staging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11639)|
| 3:14:07| areas and parking lots must be no closer to 300 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| and remove everything within 300 feet of a property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| and remove all the uses that are listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| and just assume that 300 feet is the minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11655)|
| 3:14:18| But I would suggest leaving the part in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| The planning commission could reduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11660)|
| 3:14:22| If it's shown that unique characteristics of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11662)|
| 3:14:24| is not going to impact adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| Because that hard number is kind of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11666)|
| 3:14:31| you're trying to do a catch-all with a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11671)|
| 3:14:38| And there's some instances where you can look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| and be like, well, this is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11680)|
| 3:14:42| not going to impact anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11682)|
| 3:14:43| If they're 250 feet from this particular lot line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| it's got a huge slope that goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11685)|
| 3:14:48| And they're not going to be, the next property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11688)|
| 3:14:51| is not going to be impacted by it being 50 feet closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| But I would suggest having some flexibility in that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11695)|
| 3:15:01| But that's up to you all if you want to do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11701)|
| 3:15:05| But anyway, I'm a little hesitant to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| too many standards in the similar use determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11707)|
| 3:15:12| language, even though I did put some in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11712)|
| 3:15:14| I was trying to hem it in so that it's not leashed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11714)|
| 3:15:18| into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| And we're going to get a bunch of requests everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| I was trying to make sure that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| pretty unique circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11726)|
| 3:15:31| I'm still thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11731)|
| 3:15:32| But the leak out into the county and other circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11732)|
| 3:15:37| one of the things I worry about is the potential for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11737)|
| 3:15:44| to be where a mountain biking trail would be totally fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11744)|
| 3:15:50| because it's not loud or oil operated or tearing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11750)|
| 3:15:56| the land as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11756)|
| 3:15:57| That could mountain bike trails, things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11757)|
| 3:16:01| that have been allowed in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11761)|
| 3:16:05| become used in this way, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11765)|
| 3:16:08| be a totally different usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11768)|
| 3:16:10| And I'm just wondering if this policy would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11770)|
| 3:16:14| is it opening sort of a gate for that to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11774)|
| 3:16:17| I mean, I-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11777)|
| 3:16:18| Or horseback riding for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| Maybe the applicant can address what their thoughts were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11779)|
| 3:16:22| Because I think their primary use is the motorized trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11782)|
| 3:16:28| I think they mentioned that it might be used sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11788)|
| 3:16:31| for non-motorized use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11791)|
| 3:16:36| And there's nothing in the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11796)|
| 3:16:37| So this is a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| But I mean, it's not a park that's open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| just to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11802)|
| 3:16:43| So I think I'd think about that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11803)|
| 3:16:44| It's a commercial establishment, not just like a public park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11804)|
| 3:16:49| with trails on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11809)|
| 3:16:53| And whether or not you want to remove the non-motorized part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| from it, just to make it explicit that it's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| in relation to the motorized trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11819)|
| 3:17:07| I'm going to look at this for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11829)|
| 3:17:11| Yeah, so this question is for you, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11831)|
| 3:17:14| As I'm looking through this, I'm seeing other uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11834)|
| 3:17:17| including aircraft landing fails, rifle ranges, mining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11837)|
| 3:17:20| and mineral extraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11840)|
| 3:17:22| All of those are exceptionally loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11842)|
| 3:17:24| And in fact, you based one of this 300-foot setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11844)|
| 3:17:27| specifically on the mineral extraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11847)|
| 3:17:31| Not a miner, but I imagine they use dynamite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11851)|
| 3:17:32| when they mine in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| And I can imagine that being quite noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11854)|
| 3:17:38| But to the point, are there specific noise mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11858)|
| 3:17:44| or codes in place for those different uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11864)|
| 3:17:48| that are not based on the county one, that are specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11868)|
| 3:17:51| or go beyond what is already listed in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11871)|
| 3:17:57| The mining and mineral extraction, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| I'm trying to remember if it actually requires the berms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11881)|
| 3:18:09| I kind of feel like it does, but I could be mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11889)|
| 3:18:12| I know berms are encouraged, or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11892)|
| 3:18:15| But basically, it helps with the sound and the dust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| that have the berms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11898)|
| 3:18:19| Usually, those mining operations need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| to have a place to put their overburden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| and they end up in berms to help reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11903)|
| 3:18:25| sound and other negative impacts to adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11905)|
| 3:18:29| But I can't remember if that was an explicit requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11909)|
| 3:18:32| that they build the berms, or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11912)|
| 3:18:33| I could look it up and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11913)|
| 3:18:36| I guess that's what I'm wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11916)|
| 3:18:37| because we're talking about making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11917)|
| 3:18:38| that we have on this use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11918)|
| 3:18:40| perhaps in the future, specific noise mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| But if we don't have those on things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| that I would imagine can be significantly louder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| like aircraft landing fields, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| hit well north of 120 decibels on any given time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11931)|
| 3:18:54| and we don't have noise ordinances in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11934)|
| 3:18:55| for those, other than what's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| in the books for the County Nord ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| I don't understand why we would do that for a trail riding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11939)|
| 3:19:02| facility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| I guess I just would like to know if we already have those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| and whether or not this should be modeled based on other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11947)|
| 3:19:10| on review that have fairly intense noise generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11950)|
| 3:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11954)|
| 3:19:17| Commissioner Mattis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| Yeah, I guess along the same lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11959)|
| 3:19:22| I was wondering, do you look at any kind of buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| requiring buffers between, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11964)|
| 3:19:26| residential uses and these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11966)|
| 3:19:29| if it gets approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11969)|
| 3:19:32| Well, that was the, I mean, other than the setback now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11972)|
| 3:19:37| that there is a 300 foot setback that I was recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11977)|
| 3:19:41| Well, it is recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| So no 300 feet from residences, and parks, and schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11984)|
| 3:19:48| and other types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11988)|
| 3:19:51| And that's for the trails, the parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11991)|
| 3:19:55| Will we be able to review the plan and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| like we could say, we'll protect this area in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=11999)|
| 3:20:03| as a buffer between residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12003)|
| 3:20:07| Yeah, as recommended, they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| to bring back a development plan, like a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12009)|
| 3:20:13| plan, which would be, show the trail system where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12013)|
| 3:20:18| their parking areas are, their access, their, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12018)|
| 3:20:21| a lot of this, the applicant wants to discuss the can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12021)|
| 3:20:25| but they can, anyway, yes, you can look at what's existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12025)|
| 3:20:33| and say, protect this stand of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| between the adjacent property in your parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| or your trails in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12038)|
| 3:20:41| Yeah, you can definitely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12041)|
| 3:20:46| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12046)|
| 3:20:49| I'm a little confused on, is this a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12049)|
| 3:20:57| is the trail riding, let's see, off-road motorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12057)|
| 3:21:03| and non-motorized vehicle, is this a new use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12063)|
| 3:21:09| So the use is not listed in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12069)|
| 3:21:12| So it's not that we're creating a new use per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12072)|
| 3:21:15| We're saying that if this gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12075)|
| 3:21:18| the planning commission is saying that this use is similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12078)|
| 3:21:21| to other uses in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| And in this way, is it considered similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12083)|
| 3:21:27| And so anybody would have to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12087)|
| 3:21:28| with this particular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12088)|
| 3:21:31| If they met the criteria of that use, as we've stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12091)|
| 3:21:34| then they could move forward to the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12094)|
| 3:21:37| They can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12097)|
| 3:21:38| But can other properties can as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12098)|
| 3:21:41| Yeah, the way that similar use works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12101)|
| 3:21:44| is it's meant to be broadcasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| It's not for an individual use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| And the planning commission is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12108)|
| 3:21:51| required to agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| You can deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12114)|
| 3:21:55| You can modify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12115)|
| 3:21:57| You can do what you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12117)|
| 3:21:58| But as recommended, it would be applicable to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12118)|
| 3:22:04| or any property owner that met these criteria, as stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12124)|
| 3:22:07| And really, a lot of it has to do with the 100-acre land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12127)|
| 3:22:12| area is one criteria that somebody would have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12132)|
| 3:22:16| Some of them are design criteria, not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| land criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| So if someone else came with a similar use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12141)|
| 3:22:26| and it's used on review, we wouldn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12146)|
| 3:22:31| have to follow these exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12151)|
| 3:22:34| Let's say it's a situation, different situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12154)|
| 3:22:37| and we want to add to this or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12157)|
| 3:22:41| If they're going through that use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| we could do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| Add on to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12165)|
| 3:22:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12166)|
| 3:22:46| Make it more strict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12166)|
| 3:22:47| Yeah, like if another case came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12167)|
| 3:22:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12170)|
| 3:22:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12170)|
| 3:22:52| Point being with that, this is an existing business that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12172)|
| 3:22:56| been in operation for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| And I definitely commend you for the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| that you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12183)|
| 3:23:04| So I think that, as it is, this is appropriate for what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12184)|
| 3:23:10| before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12190)|
| 3:23:11| I do think that I could imagine a situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12191)|
| 3:23:15| another application comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| and we may want to modify some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12197)|
| 3:23:21| But I think that this is a decent base, a good base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12201)|
| 3:23:26| to work off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| My only question is, is there a reference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12208)|
| 3:23:33| Because I know we've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| I haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| Is there a reference to county's noise ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12216)|
| 3:23:40| or is that necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12220)|
| 3:23:43| It's going to be applicable regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| Yeah, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12225)|
| 3:23:46| So with that, I'll make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12226)|
| 3:23:49| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12229)|
| 3:23:53| So we've got a motion to approve by Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12233)|
| 3:23:57| per staff recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12237)|
| 3:24:02| And we still have lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12242)|
| 3:24:03| Commissioner Quinta?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| OK, Commissioner Barger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| Just one quick question about the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12247)|
| 3:24:09| from 7 p.m. to 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| I totally understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12251)|
| 3:24:12| Can they apply for a permit or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12252)|
| 3:24:16| to be able to do that on Halloween?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12256)|
| 3:24:18| Because I know that they were trying to do haunted trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12258)|
| 3:24:20| rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12260)|
| 3:24:24| Is there a special permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| I mean, the way that this is written, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| Well, it says, unless otherwise approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12273)|
| 3:24:34| So no motorized trail riding permissible between 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12274)|
| 3:24:37| and 9 a.m., unless otherwise approved by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12277)|
| 3:24:40| Commission during the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12280)|
| 3:24:42| Yeah, I just didn't know how to word that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12282)|
| 3:24:43| Well, they would have to make that request during the use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12283)|
| 3:24:47| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12287)|
| 3:24:48| So if they knew it's a certain day or set of weeks of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12288)|
| 3:24:54| if they wanted to do it, and say it would only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12294)|
| 3:24:56| be two nights of the entire year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12296)|
| 3:25:00| then the Planning Commission could approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| And that's not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12303)|
| 3:25:04| Hopefully they have a time frame attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12304)|
| 3:25:05| That's a different time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12307)|
| 3:25:08| So as it's recommended, there's a default time of no riding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12308)|
| 3:25:16| between 7 p.m. and 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12316)|
| 3:25:19| If the applicant makes explicit requests for a different time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12319)|
| 3:25:25| then they can make that during the use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12325)|
| 3:25:28| But if they don't make a specific request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| then it's 7 p.m. to 9 a.m. no riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12334)|
| 3:25:35| Mr. Elliott, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12337)|
| 3:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12338)|
| 3:25:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12339)|
| 3:25:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12339)|
| 3:25:40| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12340)|
| 3:25:41| Yeah, can I ask the applicant a couple of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12341)|
| 3:25:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12344)|
| 3:25:44| Is that OK since we, because as I, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12346)|
| 3:25:47| I'd like to say something about the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| But that's one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12349)|
| 3:25:50| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12350)|
| 3:25:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12350)|
| 3:25:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12351)|
| 3:25:52| I wanted to see if you could speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12352)|
| 3:25:53| to your current business's sound and distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12353)|
| 3:26:00| And I have another question, but those two first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12360)|
| 3:26:03| So this is trail riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| This is not a racetrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12365)|
| 3:26:08| You guys may not be familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12368)|
| 3:26:10| but a lot of the motocross race bikes are very loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12370)|
| 3:26:13| They go way over 100 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| But your trail riding machines are a lot quieter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12375)|
| 3:26:18| and they're designed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| And I've had several racers and side-by-sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12380)|
| 3:26:24| that come to the place where they have straight pipes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12384)|
| 3:26:27| and it's just extremely noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| I tell them to fix it or get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12389)|
| 3:26:32| I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12392)|
| 3:26:32| And they don't come back, because they like that noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| and I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12395)|
| 3:26:38| We have family members across the street that are feuding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12398)|
| 3:26:42| And one likes to blow a train horn all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| long up and down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| And I have called to find out what the noise ordinance is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12407)|
| 3:26:53| and I got nowhere, and could not come up with a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12413)|
| 3:26:57| couldn't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12417)|
| 3:26:58| Somebody said, you just deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| I'm seeing some nodding of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| who seem to have had that trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12423)|
| 3:27:04| You know, about the train, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12424)|
| 3:27:06| Mr. McGuire, could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| Patrick McGuire, 1112 Tarklin Valley Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12428)|
| 3:27:13| So about the night riding, it's two times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12433)|
| 3:27:18| One's coming up the 21st of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12438)|
| 3:27:19| We have Jeep Invasion and Pigeon Forge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12439)|
| 3:27:22| if you guys heard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12442)|
| 3:27:24| We have some people come from California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| that do a live show out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12446)|
| 3:27:28| And the show goes from 8 to 9 PM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12448)|
| 3:27:31| And after that, we like to do a night ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| And it's Jeeps, quiet Jeeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12453)|
| 3:27:34| There's no side-by-sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12454)|
| 3:27:35| There's no dirt bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12455)|
| 3:27:36| There's no loud four-wheelers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| And by 11 o'clock, everybody's tired and ready to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12458)|
| 3:27:41| And the only other time is for Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| We like to do a Halloween event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| And again, it goes till about 11 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| and everybody's tired and wants to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| And it's just Jeeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12469)|
| 3:27:50| It's quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12470)|
| 3:27:53| My definition of quiet may be different than yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12473)|
| 3:27:56| But you were unsuccessful in being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12476)|
| 3:27:59| able to get a reading on what your establishment's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12479)|
| 3:28:02| current sound output is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12482)|
| 3:28:08| Well, I did some research on a variety of trail vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12488)|
| 3:28:14| razors, dirt bikes, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| And they are all bouncing around the 100 decibel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12496)|
| 3:28:19| They're a little lower, a little higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| And like I said, I've been around this my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| And when I hear super loud exhaust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12503)|
| 3:28:26| I tell them, you guys can't bring that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12506)|
| 3:28:27| It's too loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12507)|
| 3:28:28| It's annoying to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12508)|
| 3:28:29| It's annoying to anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| I don't want to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12511)|
| 3:28:32| So I don't have an exact number for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12512)|
| 3:28:34| But I'm the one that regulates that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12514)|
| 3:28:36| because I don't want to hear it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| So that still seems like it's in vague territory to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12519)|
| 3:28:43| But distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| Can you speak to your current business's distance from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12525)|
| 3:28:51| This policy is talking about 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12531)|
| 3:28:55| Is yours in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| Is it more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12537)|
| 3:28:58| What's the distance that you are from other residences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12538)|
| 3:29:03| So I have one neighbor that decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12543)|
| 3:29:06| to build his house pretty close to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12546)|
| 3:29:08| way before we ever bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12548)|
| 3:29:11| Super nice guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12551)|
| 3:29:12| He actually takes his side-by-side out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| and rides once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| He's never complained, and I've asked him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12556)|
| 3:29:19| And I do have one trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12559)|
| 3:29:22| It's close to 300 feet to his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12562)|
| 3:29:24| It might come in within that a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| and I can move the trail if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12566)|
| 3:29:29| But what we do is, anytime we have a night ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12569)|
| 3:29:32| we ask people to avoid that one trail after dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12572)|
| 3:29:36| just to give him some privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| So is that the only trail that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12579)|
| 3:29:42| aware of that is in the proximity of 300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12582)|
| 3:29:45| It's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12585)|
| 3:29:45| The only one that comes even close to any residence at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12585)|
| 3:29:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| What would you say the average distance is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12592)|
| 3:29:53| Can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12593)|
| 3:29:54| There's no other houses around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12594)|
| 3:29:57| We're on the south side of Felsen and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| right on top of Bays Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| I mean, literally right on the top of the mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| is the southern point of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12603)|
| 3:30:05| And to the west is a vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12605)|
| 3:30:08| To the east is one neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12608)|
| 3:30:11| Then to the north is Tarkman Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12611)|
| 3:30:17| My point in asking these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12617)|
| 3:30:19| is I understand this is an existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12619)|
| 3:30:22| It's certainly not trying to impede someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12622)|
| 3:30:24| who's been doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12624)|
| 3:30:27| I'm trying to learn from what your business is doing right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12627)|
| 3:30:31| now to try and put some greater specificity into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12631)|
| 3:30:35| because I am really worried about the sound issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12635)|
| 3:30:38| And it seems like that's still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12638)|
| 3:30:41| And the 300 feet, the fact that it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12641)|
| 3:30:46| can't be any closer than 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| But if there are no trees, if there's nothing else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| that could be not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| So I'm also concerned about that and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12654)|
| 3:30:56| to figure out a way to make sure that we can enforce something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12656)|
| 3:31:00| Down the road, it's not your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12660)|
| 3:31:01| but someone else who's trying to do the same thing who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| doesn't have the same topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| Well, the one house that's there that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12665)|
| 3:31:06| fully wooded between the trail and his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12666)|
| 3:31:12| And if we overlook anything today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12672)|
| 3:31:16| may I remind you that when the use-on review comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12676)|
| 3:31:20| we'll be able to take another stab at it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12680)|
| 3:31:23| So I understand the effort to try to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| as precise as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12685)|
| 3:31:28| So today, we're looking at this particular policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12688)|
| 3:31:33| And then on another day, we'll actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| look at the use-on review for this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12695)|
| 3:31:39| Can we have, in the meantime, some sound component?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12699)|
| 3:31:43| I would like there to be some sound addition to this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12703)|
| 3:31:47| I think it may warrant some further investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12707)|
| 3:31:52| And Mr. Reynolds may come back and give us that or say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12712)|
| 3:31:56| let's keep it vague for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12716)|
| 3:32:00| Yeah, I think during the use-on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| you could add conditions regarding sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12722)|
| 3:32:09| So I don't think this is the only opportunity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12729)|
| 3:32:12| And like I said before, I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12732)|
| 3:32:14| have the research and knowledge to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12734)|
| 3:32:16| what a number to put in this would be right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12736)|
| 3:32:22| Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12742)|
| 3:32:23| Could we add some language saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| that it will be treated on a case-by-case basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| Well, I think the nature of the use-on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12747)|
| 3:32:30| is a case-by-case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12750)|
| 3:32:33| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12753)|
| 3:32:34| I just want to clarify something to Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12754)|
| 3:32:37| I drive a Jeep and a side-by-side and a four-wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12757)|
| 3:32:40| And my Jeep going wide open is only 70 decimals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12760)|
| 3:32:43| And that's going 75 miles an hour on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12763)|
| 3:32:46| And my K&M, which is a side-by-side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12766)|
| 3:32:49| is 91 decimals when it's going wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12769)|
| 3:32:53| But the point of having an off-road trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| is to try to get stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| So you're never going 70 miles an hour or 50 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12777)|
| 3:33:03| We go out there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12783)|
| 3:33:04| It's not to his, but to other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12784)|
| 3:33:06| It's really not as loud as you think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| So I just wanted to put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12791)|
| 3:33:11| We're getting some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| When you get stuck, though, isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| that when you're really revving an engine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12795)|
| 3:33:16| and making it a lot louder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12796)|
| 3:33:18| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12798)|
| 3:33:19| The revving is when you go fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| So getting stuck is just you're crawling over rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12801)|
| 3:33:25| These are things I never expected to be discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12805)|
| 3:33:28| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12808)|
| 3:33:29| I'm your resident redneck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12809)|
| 3:33:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12810)|
| 3:33:32| Will you send us a video of that K&M going wide open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12812)|
| 3:33:35| Yeah, we accidentally got on the interstate with it one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| So I know how fast it goes and how loud it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12818)|
| 3:33:41| So the 70 decibels has been a point of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12821)|
| 3:33:46| And Mr. Murphy spoke about 65 decibels at a property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12826)|
| 3:33:52| I think we are starting to get some numbers here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| that I hope when we come back, we can put those in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12834)|
| 3:33:58| So it's still case by case, but we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12838)|
| 3:34:01| got something to point to that's meaningful for all those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12841)|
| 3:34:04| who are living and living their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| around these establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12848)|
| 3:34:12| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12852)|
| 3:34:12| And I might add, we don't have any mud holes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| where people are just revving their engines all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12854)|
| 3:34:17| So the staff recommendation is approve a trail ride facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12857)|
| 3:34:22| for off-road motorized and non-motorized vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12862)|
| 3:34:24| to a use permitted on review in the agricultural zone subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12864)|
| 3:34:28| to the locational and area regulations listed below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12868)|
| 3:34:31| The planning commission may require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12871)|

| 3:36:15| Staff recommendation, this is going to be two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12975)|
| 3:36:19| First motion, approve the variance for plat approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12979)|
| 3:36:22| without the benefit of a survey of lot 22 of Richmond Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12982)|
| 3:36:27| based on the following evidence of hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12987)|

| 3:36:33| that the attorney is going to require me to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| So the adjacent lot to the east is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12995)|
| 3:36:38| under separate ownership from the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=12998)|
| 3:36:41| of this plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13001)|
| 3:36:42| Lot 22 of Richmond Heights was subdivided by deed in 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13002)|

| 3:36:48| for the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| To include the adjacent parcel on the plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13010)|
| 3:36:52| the property owner would have to survey property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13012)|

| 3:36:57| Item two, since lot 22 is comprised of two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13017)|
| 3:37:00| under separate ownership, the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13020)|
| 3:37:02| would have to survey property that does not belong to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13022)|
| 3:37:05| should the variance not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| Item three, it is not for financial reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13027)|
| 3:37:09| that the variance is being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13029)|

| 3:37:16| would not be detrimental to the public safety, health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13036)|
| 3:37:19| or welfare of the public, nor would it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| be injurious to other properties in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13041)|

| 3:38:15| All right, on to item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13095)|

| 3:38:27| west side of North Broadway, north of Oglewood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13107)|
| 3:38:30| Approximate size of tract, 4.18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13110)|
| 3:38:33| Present zoning, office, and floodplain overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13113)|
| 3:38:36| Zoning requested, CG2 and floodplain overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13116)|
| 3:38:40| Existing land use is public, quasi-public land, church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13120)|
| 3:38:46| Staff recommendation, approve the CG2 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13126)|
| 3:38:49| because it is consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| The floodway overlay district would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13131)|

| 3:39:13| Michelle Ivester, Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13153)|
| 3:39:17| Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13157)|
| 3:39:18| I'm not really here for opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13158)|
| 3:39:20| just more for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| According to what I've read in the article of WBIR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13163)|
| 3:39:27| et cetera, the CARM purchased the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| for office use for counseling for women and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13169)|
| 3:39:33| And if it's already zoned office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13173)|
| 3:39:36| I'm wondering why the need for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13176)|
| 3:39:39| A lot of neighbors have reached out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| They're very concerned that this might lead to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13181)|
| 3:39:44| that's detrimental to our neighborhood later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13184)|
| 3:39:47| So I'd like to either request a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| so that we can set up a meeting for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| to meet with the group and see what their actual plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13191)|
| 3:39:55| There was no information really submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13195)|
| 3:39:59| with their application to know what their use is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13199)|
| 3:40:03| And we're just really confused about why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13203)|
| 3:40:04| they're needing commercial when all they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13204)|
| 3:40:06| is counseling, et cetera, for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13206)|
| 3:40:16| And Ben Mullins here for CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13216)|
| 3:40:18| And we'd be glad to meet with them between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13218)|
| 3:40:21| and when we go for city council for two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| I can answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13223)|
| 3:40:26| It's partially zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13226)|
| 3:40:28| Part of the property is already zoned CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13228)|
| 3:40:30| Part of his office, CARM, is in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13230)|
| 3:40:32| They did relocate their offices there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13232)|
| 3:40:35| There are a couple of uses that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| intend to do on the property that the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13237)|
| 3:40:40| use will not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13240)|
| 3:40:41| Specifically, there's educational facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| which isn't allowed in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| There's catering kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| They have an abundant life kitchen program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| They wanted to operate out of that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13249)|
| 3:40:51| that the office would not allow, but the CG2 zone would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13251)|
| 3:40:57| And reception facilities, they do lease it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13257)|
| 3:41:00| to an Hispanic church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13260)|
| 3:41:02| And weddings and receptions are a secondary use to a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13262)|
| 3:41:06| But if we wanted to have a reception facility for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13266)|
| 3:41:09| that's CARM related as part of our primary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13269)|
| 3:41:12| office doesn't allow that as a primary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13272)|
| 3:41:13| The CG would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| So those are the three uses that we are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| looking at and centered around with this zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13277)|
| 3:41:24| I've actually highlighted the different uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| between the CG and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| There's not a lot of differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13287)|
| 3:41:30| Like a homeless shelter or things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13290)|
| 3:41:32| would not be allowed in either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13292)|
| 3:41:33| But we'd be glad to meet with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13293)|
| 3:41:36| and talk to them more as we move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13296)|
| 3:41:38| But considering that part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13298)|
| 3:41:41| is already zoned CG2 and there's not a lot of differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13301)|
| 3:41:44| in zoning, we'd ask that you'd approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13304)|
| 3:41:46| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13306)|
| 3:41:47| And we'll be happy to get their information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| and try to set something up, maybe even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| with the district commissioner or district council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| member in the city there between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13313)|
| 3:41:55| and the readings with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13315)|
| 3:41:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13318)|
| 3:42:00| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13320)|
| 3:42:01| Motion to approve per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13321)|
| 3:42:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13324)|
| 3:42:06| We have a motion to approve by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13326)|
| 3:42:09| seconded by Commissioner Gill to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13329)|
| 3:42:12| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13332)|
| 3:42:14| I'm sorry, we've got lights still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13334)|
| 3:42:16| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13336)|
| 3:42:18| Because counselor kept talking about part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13338)|
| 3:42:21| is already zoned CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| And I'm just looking at the hatch part that's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13343)|
| 3:42:26| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13346)|
| 3:42:27| OK, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13347)|
| 3:42:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13352)|
| 3:42:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13353)|
| 3:42:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13354)|
| 3:42:41| Agenda item 44, applicant Taylor Forrester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13361)|
| 3:42:44| location south side of Kingston Pike, west side of Agnes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13364)|
| 3:42:47| 0.94 acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| Present zoning CG3, zoning requested CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13369)|
| 3:42:52| Staff recommendation, deny the CG1 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13372)|
| 3:42:55| because its dimensional standards and lack of design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13375)|
| 3:42:58| standards are incompatible with adopted land use plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13378)|
| 3:43:01| and surrounding infrastructure and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13387)|
| 3:43:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13390)|
| 3:43:11| I see no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13391)|
| 3:43:12| You may proceed, Mr. Counselor Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13392)|
| 3:43:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13397)|
| 3:43:21| Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| Here on behalf of the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13403)|
| 3:43:24| requesting rezoning for these two tracks on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13404)|
| 3:43:28| and the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13408)|
| 3:43:30| This property is located near the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| of Kingston and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13412)|
| 3:43:33| I'm sure most people, probably everybody here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13413)|
| 3:43:36| is familiar with that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13416)|
| 3:43:37| It's a heavily trafficked major vehicular thoroughfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13417)|
| 3:43:43| with substantial amount of traffic on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13423)|
| 3:43:46| and then crossing in between Kingston Pike via North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13426)|
| 3:43:54| The staff's recommendation is largely based on, as noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13434)|
| 3:43:58| is the CG1 not having design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13438)|
| 3:44:01| And the CG1, they state that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13441)|
| 3:44:05| consistent with the sector plan designation, the mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13445)|
| 3:44:07| specialty district, one for the West City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13447)|
| 3:44:12| and the Bearden Village opportunities plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13452)|
| 3:44:14| So with the design standards, the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13454)|
| 3:44:16| that there aren't design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13456)|
| 3:44:18| that's something we can't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13458)|
| 3:44:20| That was something, I guess, determined by city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13460)|
| 3:44:22| to not include design standards for CG1 zone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13462)|
| 3:44:28| Again, what that rationale was, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13468)|
| 3:44:31| But that's outside of our purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13471)|
| 3:44:35| outside of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13475)|
| 3:44:36| The sector plan, this mixed use specialty district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13476)|
| 3:44:40| for the West City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13480)|
| 3:44:42| So interesting, the last time the West City sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13482)|
| 3:44:45| was updated was in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13485)|
| 3:44:48| If I'm looking at the sector plan update amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13488)|
| 3:44:51| correctly, I believe that's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13491)|
| 3:44:54| that was updated prior to the recode adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13494)|
| 3:44:58| by the city of Knoxville, which was I think January 1, 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13498)|
| 3:45:03| or 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| So there hadn't been an update to that sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13505)|
| 3:45:09| since recode was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13509)|
| 3:45:12| Interesting, with that position, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13512)|
| 3:45:14| look from North Shore all the way back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13514)|
| 3:45:19| towards Western Plaza through the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13519)|
| 3:45:23| you'll see that the majority of the properties outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| of the Humberg area, the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| of the properties that front Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13527)|
| 3:45:31| are going to be zoned CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13531)|
| 3:45:34| Outside of Bearden Elementary, a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13534)|
| 3:45:37| everything for the most part is zoned CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13537)|
| 3:45:40| except for this little section towards the North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13540)|
| 3:45:44| intersection, which really doesn't make a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13544)|
| 3:45:47| and that's likely your most heavily vehicular trafficked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13547)|
| 3:45:50| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| Across the street, there's a CG3 zoning on the Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13552)|
| 3:45:56| Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13556)|
| 3:45:59| I actually talked to that property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| earlier this week on another matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13561)|
| 3:46:02| and he was inquiring about this and basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13562)|
| 3:46:06| indicated that that building will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13566)|
| 3:46:09| And the thought of, OK, if you had a new grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13569)|
| 3:46:12| go in there, would a food city up along the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13572)|
| 3:46:17| really make a lot of sense there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13577)|
| 3:46:20| In the sector plan, it acknowledges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13580)|
| 3:46:23| that the Bearden Village, it refers to it as the village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13583)|
| 3:46:27| is actually characterized as having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| several different development forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| You've got some maybe closer to the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| some set further back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13593)|
| 3:46:36| The Bearden Village Opportunities Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13596)|
| 3:46:38| we dealt with this and this came up on something a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13598)|
| 3:46:43| or so ago on Kingston Pike and it was a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13603)|
| 3:46:46| review on a property zoned CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13606)|
| 3:46:49| And the recommendation approval by this planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13609)|
| 3:46:52| was that it was appropriate, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13612)|
| 3:46:57| had to find that it was adhered to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| complied with the sector plan designation and the Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13619)|
| 3:47:04| Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13624)|
| 3:47:05| That Bearden plan has four, I guess, zones or areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13625)|
| 3:47:12| The Homburg area is the one that addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13632)|
| 3:47:15| the walkability and the approach of having a walkable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13635)|
| 3:47:19| and that's what makes sense to have the CG3 in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13639)|
| 3:47:24| I'm trying to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13644)|
| 3:47:27| Majority of the lots in this stretch of Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13647)|
| 3:47:31| here along Kingston Piker, they're very small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13651)|
| 3:47:35| Having a zero to 20 foot minimum setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13655)|
| 3:47:40| really restricts the use of that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13660)|
| 3:47:43| At the agenda review meeting, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13663)|
| 3:47:45| discussed about Agnes Road, the setbacks, site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13665)|
| 3:47:48| So Agnes Road, I believe, a driveway off of Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13668)|
| 3:47:52| would have to be 150 feet west of Agnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13672)|
| 3:47:58| and then T dot, which those updated driveway curb cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13678)|
| 3:48:02| requirements have been updated since the adoption of recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13682)|
| 3:48:06| the adoption of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13686)|
| 3:48:08| Those have to be 20 feet offset that adjacent boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13688)|
| 3:48:12| So this property is approximately 190, 195 linear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13692)|
| 3:48:16| feet of frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13696)|
| 3:48:17| So let's use 190 as an easy number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13697)|
| 3:48:20| We've got 150 plus 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13700)|
| 3:48:22| That basically leaves us a 20 foot section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13702)|
| 3:48:25| to have a curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| So that really restricts or maybe even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13707)|
| 3:48:30| precludes the development of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13710)|
| 3:48:32| because if that building has to be brought to the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13712)|
| 3:48:36| or 20 feet or less, there's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13716)|
| 3:48:39| no way to access this property from Kingston Pike, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13719)|
| 3:48:45| again, really I think is an unintended consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13725)|
| 3:48:50| of the type of zoning and further shows that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13730)|
| 3:48:52| an appropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13732)|
| 3:48:54| We believe that the CG1 makes sense here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13734)|
| 3:48:57| You look up and down Bearden, CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| is throughout on these Kingston Pike properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| especially ones around these sizes, this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13741)|
| 3:49:05| We'd ask that you not follow staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13745)|
| 3:49:09| and approve the request to rezone the property to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13749)|
| 3:49:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13752)|
| 3:49:19| OK, we've got some new commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| And there's a lot of history with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13761)|
| 3:49:24| even though it's a new zoning, relatively new zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13764)|
| 3:49:27| When was our recode adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13767)|
| 3:49:29| What year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13769)|
| 3:49:30| 2019, it went into effect January 1, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13770)|
| 3:49:34| January 1, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13774)|
| 3:49:38| I personally supported the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13778)|
| 3:49:40| However, there were some issues out of the gate with recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13780)|
| 3:49:45| with some of the zonings, and in particular CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13785)|
| 3:49:49| And what I'd like to do is spend a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13789)|
| 3:49:51| to just identify some of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| that we have, not just because it's CG2 or CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13794)|
| 3:49:59| but where CG2 and CG3 are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13799)|
| 3:50:02| Because there are specific areas that we did not foresee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13802)|
| 3:50:06| And I think there was an error in the zoning when we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13806)|
| 3:50:11| And I want to talk more particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13811)|
| 3:50:13| CG2 and CG3 is essentially bringing a downtown-type design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13813)|
| 3:50:19| to other areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| Just think of that, of bringing a downtown design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13821)|
| 3:50:25| So I want to talk about some challenging components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| as to why it's very difficult to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13828)|
| 3:50:32| Not impossible, but difficult. But the one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13832)|
| 3:50:35| what I would call the elephant in the city, is TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13835)|
| 3:50:39| TDOT has all the authority over the state routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13839)|
| 3:50:44| And in particular, that makes it more challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13844)|
| 3:50:48| is that it's a major arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13848)|
| 3:50:51| So when you think of downtown, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13851)|
| 3:50:54| think of wide sidewalks, buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13854)|
| 3:50:59| pushed up to the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13859)|
| 3:51:03| You have on-street parking, which protects pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13863)|
| 3:51:08| That's a barrier between the pedestrian and moving cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13868)|
| 3:51:12| You typically have an average mile per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13872)|
| 3:51:16| I would guess, 10 to 15 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13876)|
| 3:51:19| as you go down Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13879)|
| 3:51:22| So now, what I would like for us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13882)|
| 3:51:24| is let's take the other city's zoning to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13884)|
| 3:51:31| So let's change the speed limit to 45 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13891)|
| 3:51:37| Let's change the sidewalks from 10 to 14 feet to four feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13897)|
| 3:51:44| Let's put no buffers or on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13904)|
| 3:51:48| Let's add curb cuts to the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13908)|
| 3:51:52| And let's impose parking minimums on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13912)|
| 3:51:58| So as you see, when you reverse the comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13918)|
| 3:52:04| it's very, very difficult to bring other city to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13924)|
| 3:52:09| just like it is very difficult to bring downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13929)|
| 3:52:12| to other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| I'm not saying all parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| I think Holmberg is very appropriate for CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13936)|
| 3:52:20| I think you could argue one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13940)|
| 3:52:22| with Western Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13942)|
| 3:52:24| But you're looking at two major arterials here, North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| Drive and Kingston Pike, running 45 to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13948)|
| 3:52:32| The posted speed limit is 45 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13952)|
| 3:52:36| I think human nature says, if it's 45, I can go 50, 55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13956)|
| 3:52:41| and that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13961)|
| 3:52:42| We have absolutely no barriers between our sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13962)|
| 3:52:48| and our four-lane highway with a turning lane, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13968)|
| 3:52:52| I walked the 1.6-mile stretch yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13972)|
| 3:52:55| from North Shore and Kingston Pike to Western Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13975)|
| 3:53:01| You are within inches of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13981)|
| 3:53:05| as you walk down that sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13985)|
| 3:53:07| If you walk side by side or if you walk passing one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13987)|
| 3:53:11| you are right there on top of a 45, 50-mile-an-hour vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13991)|
| 3:53:16| literally this close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13996)|
| 3:53:19| And so any distracted driver, it's harrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=13999)|
| 3:53:23| I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14003)|
| 3:53:24| Another thing that was eye-opening for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14004)|
| 3:53:26| and I never really looked at it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14006)|
| 3:53:29| I said, one, we need design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14009)|
| 3:53:32| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14012)|
| 3:53:33| CG1 needs design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| We shouldn't punish the public because we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14015)|
| 3:53:38| put design standards in today, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14018)|
| 3:53:40| need to make it a priority for design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| We have, and I'm going to give this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| within the margin of error plus or minus two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14026)|
| 3:53:49| I counted 66 parcels from that stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14029)|
| 3:53:53| that I just talked about that were zone CG1, 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14033)|
| 3:53:58| I counted 21 parcels that were CG2 or CG3 along that stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14038)|
| 3:54:06| It is dominated by CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14046)|
| 3:54:10| There was a reference about a bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14050)|
| 3:54:13| that is more appropriate for CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14053)|
| 3:54:18| I counted the bus stops yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14058)|
| 3:54:20| In CG1, immediately in front of those parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14060)|
| 3:54:23| there were nine bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14063)|
| 3:54:25| In CG3, there were five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| So if I could get Nick to pull up, one, the purpose statement of CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14068)|
| 3:54:36| because I think we've somewhat made a big deal about going from CG3 to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14076)|
| 3:54:43| It's all in the same family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14083)|
| 3:54:45| And the purpose statement, I can't read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14085)|
| 3:54:49| OK, it says, if you'll bear with me here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14089)|
| 3:54:54| the CG commercial zoning district is intended to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14094)|
| 3:54:59| for a heterogeneous mix of retail, personal service, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14099)|
| 3:55:03| and residential uses within and along Knoxville's commercial nodes and corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14103)|
| 3:55:08| The CG district is intended to promote mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14108)|
| 3:55:13| in a pedestrian-oriented environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14113)|
| 3:55:15| that recalls the city's traditional business districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14115)|
| 3:55:19| and offers flexibility in the creation of integrated commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14119)|
| 3:55:23| office, and residential spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14123)|
| 3:55:26| The CG district is divided into three levels of intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14126)|
| 3:55:30| related to the overall form and design of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14130)|
| 3:55:33| However, uses are the same across all levels of CG1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14133)|
| 3:55:39| This zone is intended primarily for indoor commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14139)|
| 3:55:43| with limited exceptions per special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14143)|
| 3:55:47| So we're not talking about more intensive uses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14147)|
| 3:55:50| They're the same uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14150)|
| 3:55:53| We, I believe that, I know, I don't believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14153)|
| 3:55:57| I know that we never considered the challenges that TDOT imposed on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14157)|
| 3:56:03| One thing that we never looked at was the 2015 curb access standards of TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14163)|
| 3:56:10| TDOT never had curb access standards in our city until 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14170)|
| 3:56:17| In 1978, they updated them, and they weren't updated again until 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14177)|
| 3:56:22| and they became far more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14182)|
| 3:56:25| So they tell us, you can go down parts of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14185)|
| 3:56:28| and see the whole property is a curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14188)|
| 3:56:32| That won't happen when you redevelop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14192)|
| 3:56:35| If you're, I think it's under 150 feet wide, you get one curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14195)|
| 3:56:40| And then when they impose that you have to be 20 feet off each neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14200)|
| 3:56:44| and you have to have a 26 to 60 foot wide curb cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14204)|
| 3:56:48| it really limits how you can push that building up to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14208)|
| 3:56:52| So I'm not against CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14212)|
| 3:56:55| I'm not against CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| I think, again, I'm going to, I'm not going to think it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14217)|
| 3:57:02| There was a statement from Gerald Green said he over applied CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14222)|
| 3:57:07| So I think if you look, if you'll pull up the map and look at that stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14227)|
| 3:57:13| you will see, I don't think, I don't think there's a planner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14233)|
| 3:57:18| that can tell us the reasoning why CG1 and CG3 are where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14238)|
| 3:57:26| except for Holmberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14246)|
| 3:57:28| And if you look at the Bearden Village plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14248)|
| 3:57:31| it talks about the Kingston Pike Corridor being more intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14251)|
| 3:57:35| with bigger, tight businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14255)|
| 3:57:38| And in 2001, it could not foresee in the next five years of really that changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14258)|
| 3:57:45| Well, it hasn't really changed since 2001 to be realistic about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14265)|
| 3:57:52| So I think what we need to do as a city, we need to go back and plan and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14272)|
| 3:57:59| We need to encourage and bring all the partners together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14279)|
| 3:58:03| One, TDOT, if we really want to make this a more walkable city or areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14283)|
| 3:58:09| of more walkability, because zoning alone will not create walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14289)|
| 3:58:15| And a prime example of that, I think you need to lead with infrastructure first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14295)|
| 3:58:20| And if you look at Cumberland Avenue, that's exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14300)|
| 3:58:24| They've got 14 foot between sidewalks and buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14304)|
| 3:58:29| They've given the road a diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14309)|
| 3:58:32| TDOT basically gave the road back because I think they decertified it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14312)|
| 3:58:37| is the way that you would explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14317)|
| 3:58:39| So it's not really even under TDOT's purview now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14319)|
| 3:58:42| But that was one way of dealing with Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14322)|
| 3:58:46| But until such time that we can have wide sidewalks, reduced speeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14326)|
| 3:58:55| and all those other things that I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14335)|
| 3:58:58| we have to be more specific in the areas that we apply CG3 and CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14338)|
| 3:59:04| And I really appreciate you all being so patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14344)|
| 3:59:07| I know it's late, but I felt like there's so much history to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14347)|
| 3:59:12| that it had to be shared, especially with some of the newer folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14352)|
| 3:59:16| So with that, I'm tossing it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14356)|
| 3:59:20| Who would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14360)|
| 3:59:21| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14361)|
| 3:59:23| Thank you for the back story and the refresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14363)|
| 3:59:29| I know that this has been discussed many times, so I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14369)|
| 3:59:35| But from my understanding, the difference between CG2 and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14375)|
| 3:59:43| and then those two and one that we're looking at that is applicable here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14383)|
| 3:59:49| isn't so much the design standards, because those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14389)|
| 3:59:52| deal with fenestration and facade, but it's just the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14392)|
| 3:59:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14397)|
| 3:59:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14398)|
| 3:59:59| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14399)|
| 4:00:02| The setback, I would think, would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14402)|
| 4:00:08| that would be kind of appropriate for BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14408)|
| 4:00:12| to look at if it's related to the TDOT and curb cut considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14412)|
| 4:00:18| But before that, my concern with this whole part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14418)|
| 4:00:26| is we have this plan, the Bearden Village plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14426)|
| 4:00:34| that does include this area as one of the zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14434)|
| 4:00:38| and talks about, for the Kingston Pike commercial corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14438)|
| 4:00:42| orient buildings towards sidewalk with parking lot in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14442)|
| 4:00:47| incorporate mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14447)|
| 4:00:48| That's not really part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14448)|
| 4:00:52| Require formal tree plantings along sidewalks and within parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14452)|
| 4:00:57| It seems like we made this plan at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14457)|
| 4:01:02| to improve as a guideline for improving this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14462)|
| 4:01:07| of the challenges for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| So like you were mentioning with the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14469)|
| 4:01:13| I wouldn't want to walk on the sidewalk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14473)|
| 4:01:16| but I would want to one day be able to walk on the sidewalk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14476)|
| 4:01:20| And people do need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14480)|
| 4:01:21| You're going to have to deal with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14481)|
| 4:01:22| Well, yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14482)|
| 4:01:25| It's a major arterial, and their mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| is to push as many vehicles in and out as quickly as practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14487)|
| 4:01:33| My question is, does CG1, I'm not certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14493)|
| 4:01:42| if CG1 is in line with the Kingston Pike commercial corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14502)|
| 4:01:49| aspect of the Bearden Village plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14509)|
| 4:01:52| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14512)|
| 4:01:56| That plan was, I guess, issued in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14516)|
| 4:02:01| Bearden Village Council had input on this zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14521)|
| 4:02:06| which they promote Bearden Village plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14526)|
| 4:02:12| There were recommendations that we apply CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14532)|
| 4:02:16| to areas that are arguably more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14536)|
| 4:02:21| I want to talk about the east side that communicates with Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14541)|
| 4:02:26| So I don't know how you make sense when 70% of this stretch is CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14546)|
| 4:02:33| Did we just ignore the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14553)|
| 4:02:36| I mean, I guess what I'm saying, there's no reasoning to any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14556)|
| 4:02:40| That's my next question, more for staff, is during recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14560)|
| 4:02:43| how did it end up if CG1, with all of this being CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14563)|
| 4:02:53| was there a conversation about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14573)|
| 4:02:56| that met the Bearden Village plan during the recode process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14576)|
| 4:03:00| I'm going to let Commissioner Myers speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14580)|
| 4:03:02| because she has as much history as I do on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14582)|
| 4:03:07| and probably a varying view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14587)|
| 4:03:10| One of the concerns with CG2 and 3 were building heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14590)|
| 4:03:16| and it was believed it felt like they wanted to keep it more village feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14596)|
| 4:03:21| so CG1 was a way to ensure limiting it to 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14601)|
| 4:03:30| Because CG2 allows 70 feet in height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14610)|
| 4:03:32| CG3 is unlimited, you can build to the heavens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14612)|
| 4:03:37| Was that the primary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14617)|
| 4:03:38| I'm not going to speak for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14618)|
| 4:03:41| I will say that was one of the concerns, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14621)|
| 4:03:46| Amy, is there anything else related to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14626)|
| 4:03:50| I'll just add that there was a number of different iterations of the draft map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14630)|
| 4:03:56| and there were changes from draft map 1 to 2 to 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14636)|
| 4:04:00| and there were public comments submitted in particular in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14640)|
| 4:04:04| and to Chairman Hill's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14644)|
| 4:04:07| to reduce some of the properties that were CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14647)|
| 4:04:11| those were specific requests that came from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14651)|
| 4:04:13| and they were changed during that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14653)|
| 4:04:17| Would it make more sense for us to have an overlay zone or something here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14657)|
| 4:04:26| if we want to meet this plan, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14666)|
| 4:04:30| I don't know, that's a big ordeal to create,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14670)|
| 4:04:33| but I don't know if CG1 versus CG2 really helps us accomplish the plan that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14673)|
| 4:04:43| one way or the other, so I want to follow this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14683)|
| 4:04:49| and so I'm inclined to think that I like that CG2 and 3 have the design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14689)|
| 4:04:57| and I do think that if we can get buildings closer to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14697)|
| 4:05:03| I think that that is more appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14703)|
| 4:05:05| but I also, with everything else being CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14705)|
| 4:05:08| I don't know how much we can actually get closer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14708)|
| 4:05:13| And I appreciate your comments, and believe me, I live in Bearden, I work in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14713)|
| 4:05:19| I am one of the biggest proponents of walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14719)|
| 4:05:23| but zoning alone won't do it, and TDOT is our elephant in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14723)|
| 4:05:30| and until that changes, and how would you expect for TDOT to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14730)|
| 4:05:36| and it's not just that road, it's Clinton Highway, it's Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14736)|
| 4:05:40| the major arterials is what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14740)|
| 4:05:44| so I would state that it is unsafe to move the building to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14744)|
| 4:05:50| when now you've put the pedestrian, that four-foot sidewalk between the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14750)|
| 4:05:57| and the street is 50-mile-an-hour traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14757)|
| 4:06:00| and so that's a concern that you have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14760)|
| 4:06:02| Well, I think the, I don't know if there's any requirements here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14762)|
| 4:06:07| but what the plan was trying to avoid was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14767)|
| 4:06:13| kind of the balance to that is by saying that trees should be required right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14773)|
| 4:06:19| and that there should be kind of a buffer between the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14779)|
| 4:06:22| so the building's not right up on the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14782)|
| 4:06:23| and so that you're not, because you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14783)|
| 4:06:25| a five-foot sidewalk with cars going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14785)|
| 4:06:28| Four-foot, three inches, to be exact, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14788)|
| 4:06:32| But I do think that a building closer to the property makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14792)|
| 4:06:38| However, I also, if we look at this at a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14798)|
| 4:06:45| with this having the, this has a cemetery on the back, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14805)|
| 4:06:53| and I also wonder if maybe it's more appropriate to allow for the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14813)|
| 4:07:01| to be able to be, or parking up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14821)|
| 4:07:05| so that there's fewer conflicts with the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14825)|
| 4:07:08| I'm throwing that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14828)|
| 4:07:10| I don't have a strong opinion on it, but I think that's on my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14830)|
| 4:07:14| CG1 would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14834)|
| 4:07:17| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14837)|
| 4:07:17| CG1 would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14837)|
| 4:07:18| Oh, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14838)|
| 4:07:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14839)|
| 4:07:21| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14841)|
| 4:07:25| I keep wanting to turn that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14845)|
| 4:07:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14847)|
| 4:07:29| I don't really want to get into the history of how this became CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14849)|
| 4:07:34| as opposed to CG2 versus CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14854)|
| 4:07:39| I know Commissioner Hill and I are going to disagree on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14859)|
| 4:07:43| I want this area to be a more pedestrian area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14863)|
| 4:07:45| I live in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14865)|
| 4:07:47| There's a greenway that goes along, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14867)|
| 4:07:50| ends up crossing over and going through Agnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14870)|
| 4:07:52| It meanders that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14872)|
| 4:07:54| There is cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14874)|
| 4:07:56| There are bikes on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14876)|
| 4:07:57| There are people that get off at that bus stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14877)|
| 4:08:00| as long as the one right there by your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14880)|
| 4:08:02| There's a lot of people walking along that stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14882)|
| 4:08:07| And unfortunately, the greenway, the schools, the bus stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14887)|
| 4:08:13| the signal crosswalks, all of that is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14893)|
| 4:08:15| is not going to, people are still going to be walking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14895)|
| 4:08:19| And the original intent of having CG2 and CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14899)|
| 4:08:25| as being a more walkable environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14905)|
| 4:08:27| is by having that build-to zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14907)|
| 4:08:29| This was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14909)|
| 4:08:31| By having a build-to zone, meaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| that you have to build between 0 and 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14913)|
| 4:08:36| that's going to allow for green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14916)|
| 4:08:38| It's going to push the buildings closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14918)|
| 4:08:41| It's going to be for a more desirable, and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14921)|
| 4:08:44| a safer environment for people to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14924)|
| 4:08:47| because it will slow traffic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14927)|
| 4:08:49| You can talk about that, Amy, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14929)|
| 4:08:51| But that was always the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| of having those buildings closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14933)|
| 4:08:59| There's a lot of CG1 along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14939)|
| 4:09:02| And if they want CG1, there's a whole stretch of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14942)|
| 4:09:06| where they could develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14946)|
| 4:09:08| I feel like this property, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14948)|
| 4:09:11| because of that cemetery behind the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14951)|
| 4:09:14| it really is more conducive to CG3 and not CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14954)|
| 4:09:20| We haven't seen a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14960)|
| 4:09:22| but there is that cemetery right there in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14962)|
| 4:09:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14967)|
| 4:09:28| Can you see it right there behind the Shriner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14968)|
| 4:09:32| And currently, that building is pushed to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14972)|
| 4:09:37| It is within the building zone, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| will be changing that design layout and pulling it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14979)|
| 4:09:47| And it's working the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14987)|
| 4:09:49| There's pelicans that's right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14989)|
| 4:09:51| and I see kids playing out there in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14991)|
| 4:09:52| As a matter of fact, today when I came by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14992)|
| 4:09:54| they have a little playground area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14994)|
| 4:09:56| It's nice to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14996)|
| 4:09:58| There's plenty of CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=14998)|
| 4:10:00| There's no CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15000)|
| 4:10:02| I would support staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15002)|
| 4:10:04| to keep it the way it is and deny CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15004)|
| 4:10:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15007)|
| 4:10:09| You care to measure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15009)|
| 4:10:11| Are you able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15011)|
| 4:10:12| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15012)|
| 4:10:14| Before recode, you were required to push it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15014)|
| 4:10:17| to what was it, 25 feet, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15017)|
| 4:10:29| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15029)|
| 4:10:30| 22 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15030)|
| 4:10:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15033)|
| 4:10:34| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15034)|
| 4:10:36| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15036)|
| 4:10:40| I wanted to say thank you, Commissioner Nihill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15040)|
| 4:10:42| for kind of the history lesson on that as a new commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| It's important to have context when we're making these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15045)|
| 4:10:47| decisions, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15047)|
| 4:10:49| And also, at risk of I've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15049)|
| 4:10:51| spoken more than I intended to for my first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15051)|
| 4:10:54| and at risk of continuing to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15054)|
| 4:10:55| I wanted to say that the CG zone is of particular interest to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15055)|
| 4:10:59| I live closer to the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15059)|
| 4:11:02| And I find your analogy apt that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15062)|
| 4:11:06| wouldn't want to push Kingston Pike development down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15066)|
| 4:11:09| into the downtown district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15069)|
| 4:11:10| And there is an argument that says that we need to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15070)|
| 4:11:13| not to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15073)|
| 4:11:14| I do share Commissioner Midas's desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15074)|
| 4:11:17| to see more walkability in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15077)|
| 4:11:20| I think this is an interesting and challenging case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15080)|
| 4:11:22| I think that the bigger issue at play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15082)|
| 4:11:24| here is that the lack of design standards in CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15084)|
| 4:11:28| is a real impediment for any sort of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15088)|
| 4:11:31| in this, specifically because what I would not hope to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15091)|
| 4:11:35| is a rash, a precedent sent today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15095)|
| 4:11:36| that in any time that you run into some sort of design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15096)|
| 4:11:39| constraint, that the immediate and only way to solve that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15099)|
| 4:11:43| is to down zone to CG1 and then be completely free to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15103)|
| 4:11:46| whatever you wanted at any time, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15106)|
| 4:11:49| because in our area where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15109)|
| 4:11:51| I would like to see that downtown development continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15111)|
| 4:11:54| up, particularly on Broadway, where these conversations cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15114)|
| 4:11:57| up quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15117)|
| 4:11:58| That is an arterial, but it does have a lot of more pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15118)|
| 4:12:02| to have a more walkable environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15122)|
| 4:12:04| because all of those traditional neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15124)|
| 4:12:05| have sidewalks that reach the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15125)|
| 4:12:07| So I don't want to set a precedent today that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15127)|
| 4:12:10| is such that we allow this to be the preferred pathway forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15130)|
| 4:12:15| I know that council has stated that as such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15135)|
| 4:12:17| in their own meetings that they'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15137)|
| 4:12:18| like to see review of design standards on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15138)|
| 4:12:20| It's pretty clear on this body that that is the case as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15140)|
| 4:12:24| I think there are some definite things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15144)|
| 4:12:26| need to be considered in this, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15146)|
| 4:12:28| with TDOT, with the ability to create a curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15148)|
| 4:12:30| And I actually share Commissioner Higgins' view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15150)|
| 4:12:33| that perhaps having the building closer to the cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15153)|
| 4:12:36| makes sense, since that's where the church currently is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15156)|
| 4:12:38| and that would push parking away from the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15158)|
| 4:12:40| So in this case, it may make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15160)|
| 4:12:42| to have a CG1 in this particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15162)|
| 4:12:45| But I'm not sure that that should be how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15165)|
| 4:12:47| we handle this moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15167)|
| 4:12:50| We certainly need to make design standards a priority for CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15170)|
| 4:12:54| And when you think about that being the dominating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15174)|
| 4:12:59| replacing the C3, the old C3, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15179)|
| 4:13:02| dominates our commercial corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15182)|
| 4:13:06| and we have no design standards, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15186)|
| 4:13:08| think that's where Commissioner Midas and I can agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15188)|
| 4:13:13| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15193)|
| 4:13:14| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15194)|
| 4:13:18| I guess the thing I want to agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15198)|
| 4:13:21| is the fact that I think we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15201)|
| 4:13:24| be looking for ways to move this towards more walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15204)|
| 4:13:28| that that's the opportunity that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15208)|
| 4:13:30| And I hear what you're saying about TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15210)|
| 4:13:34| And I live on Chapman, or over in the Chapman area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15214)|
| 4:13:37| so I have that as my own experience as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15217)|
| 4:13:41| However, my question is, at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15221)|
| 4:13:46| because the development is changing, TDOT changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15226)|
| 4:13:50| And I think that this is one of those cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15230)|
| 4:13:53| where if we continue to follow plans like the Bearden plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15233)|
| 4:13:56| and look for those opportunities to create more human scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15236)|
| 4:14:01| that it does start to help that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15241)|
| 4:14:04| I know you've had a lot of experience with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15244)|
| 4:14:06| and your frustration with the issue, like I hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15246)|
| 4:14:11| So I'm just looking for ways to continue pushing that thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15251)|
| 4:14:16| that everybody wants, that walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15256)|
| 4:14:18| that more human-centric, and make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15258)|
| 4:14:22| so that even though the road has widened and it's TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15262)|
| 4:14:26| that there are reasons where we can point to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15266)|
| 4:14:28| this is why we needed to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15268)|
| 4:14:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15270)|
| 4:14:31| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15271)|
| 4:14:32| Vice Chair Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15272)|
| 4:14:35| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15275)|
| 4:14:38| Yeah, I'm familiar with, somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15278)|
| 4:14:42| when it was going through recode and we were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15282)|
| 4:14:44| about a lot of this stuff, I do feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15284)|
| 4:14:47| like there probably was a little too much CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15287)|
| 4:14:52| As you mentioned, former Director Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15292)|
| 4:14:56| had mentioned that he thought he might have overdone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15296)|
| 4:14:59| just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15299)|
| 4:15:00| But as I look at the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15300)|
| 4:15:03| if you come out of the intersection and scale it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15303)|
| 4:15:06| from the Kingston Pike and North Shore Drive intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15306)|
| 4:15:09| scale it out over to Agnes Road, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15309)|
| 4:15:11| is just on the other side, where the CG1 starts as you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15311)|
| 4:15:14| heading east on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15314)|
| 4:15:16| It's, give or take, 750 feet out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15316)|
| 4:15:20| of the intersection of North Shore Drive and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15320)|
| 4:15:25| If you go west and do the same measurement out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15325)|
| 4:15:29| of the intersection, it takes CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15329)|
| 4:15:34| There's still CG3 right around the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15334)|
| 4:15:37| but it steps up, if you will, to CG1 about 200 feet or so out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15337)|
| 4:15:45| of the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15345)|
| 4:15:46| So my point is, if they're wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15346)|
| 4:15:48| to try to contain it right around the intersection, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15348)|
| 4:15:52| to me is what the intent is, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15352)|
| 4:15:55| pushed it 750 feet one way and 200 feet on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15355)|
| 4:16:00| which is a little over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15360)|
| 4:16:02| Again, to me, if it's 550 feet out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15362)|
| 4:16:07| of the intersection of Kingston Pike and North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15367)|
| 4:16:11| where it goes to CG1, that's not a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| different than 750 feet out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15373)|
| 4:16:16| It's not like we're spot zoning this in the middle of a huge CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15376)|
| 4:16:20| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15380)|
| 4:16:21| It's right on the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15381)|
| 4:16:22| The parcel right on the other side of Agnes Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15382)|
| 4:16:24| is CG1 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15384)|
| 4:16:26| It actually borders the CG1 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15386)|
| 4:16:30| So yeah, I just think looking at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15390)|
| 4:16:33| And really, the CG1, or any CG, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15393)|
| 4:16:36| think, is really designed to increase walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15396)|
| 4:16:40| I don't think that CG1 is necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15400)|
| 4:16:43| less walkable than CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15403)|
| 4:16:45| They're intended to be pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15405)|
| 4:16:51| So I just really don't see why it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15411)|
| 4:16:55| a stretch for a lot of the reasons that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15415)|
| 4:17:00| I mean, with that, while I've got the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15420)|
| 4:17:02| I'll just go ahead and make a motion to approve CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15422)|
| 4:17:06| because it is an extension of CG1 to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15426)|
| 4:17:09| and it is compatible with the adopted land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15429)|
| 4:17:12| plan surrounding infrastructure and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15432)|
| 4:17:18| OK, we've got a motion by Vice Chair Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15438)|
| 4:17:21| to approve the CG1, seconded by Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15441)|
| 4:17:29| Let's see, I know we're going to have more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15449)|
| 4:17:32| And I also just want to add that CG1 doesn't keep you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15452)|
| 4:17:36| from moving the building to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15456)|
| 4:17:38| You can move the building to the street in CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15458)|
| 4:17:40| It gives flexibility to work with the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15460)|
| 4:17:44| that you're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15464)|
| 4:17:45| So let's go to Commissioner Overton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15465)|
| 4:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15469)|
| 4:17:50| Yeah, I love walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15470)|
| 4:17:54| I live in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15474)|
| 4:17:56| And part of the reason I don't ever want to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15476)|
| 4:17:58| is because I can walk everywhere I need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15478)|
| 4:17:59| But I have to drive here to buy things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15479)|
| 4:18:03| And I think just getting out of, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15483)|
| 4:18:07| think everyone's points about recode and the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15487)|
| 4:18:10| are extremely valid and relevant to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15490)|
| 4:18:13| But I think when you just take a step back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15493)|
| 4:18:15| and think of the times that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15495)|
| 4:18:17| driven through this intersection or been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15497)|
| 4:18:21| having buildings right up on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15501)|
| 4:18:23| even when I'm in my car, I am stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15503)|
| 4:18:26| It is not safe, in my opinion, to even be driving your car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15506)|
| 4:18:29| down Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15509)|
| 4:18:30| It's so condensed with the buildings right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15510)|
| 4:18:33| the sidewalk right there with the pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15513)|
| 4:18:35| If you're walking, I mean, that's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15515)|
| 4:18:38| I can't believe you walked that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15518)|
| 4:18:40| That's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15520)|
| 4:18:43| And I think in a weird way, whereas normally I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15523)|
| 4:18:47| would agree with everybody that CG3 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15527)|
| 4:18:49| the way to go for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15529)|
| 4:18:51| We need to be more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15531)|
| 4:18:52| We need to have big sidewalks with buffer zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15532)|
| 4:18:56| and buildings with basically no setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15536)|
| 4:19:00| I think this is a weird example just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15540)|
| 4:19:02| because of this particular intersection where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15542)|
| 4:19:05| having CG1 where you can put the building back further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15545)|
| 4:19:09| actually kind of makes it safer for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15549)|
| 4:19:11| like cars and pedestrians, because it's just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15551)|
| 4:19:14| so packed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15554)|
| 4:19:15| And I think, too, to your point about speed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15555)|
| 4:19:19| I mean, you said 55 all out myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15559)|
| 4:19:22| I mean, that's a 60 for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15562)|
| 4:19:23| I'm coming off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15563)|
| 4:19:25| I got to get to Aubrey's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| We have things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15567)|
| 4:19:28| So it's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15568)|
| 4:19:31| And I think that when we think about the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15571)|
| 4:19:33| and the reality of when you're there outside of recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15573)|
| 4:19:37| and all of that, CG1 just, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15577)|
| 4:19:39| makes sense in kind of a reverse way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15579)|
| 4:19:42| that if we were talking about a different property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15582)|
| 4:19:44| I would have the opposite opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15584)|
| 4:19:46| because I'm with you on walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15586)|
| 4:19:48| I just think we need more setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15588)|
| 4:19:50| in this area of Kingston Pike in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15590)|
| 4:19:52| So I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15592)|
| 4:19:56| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15596)|
| 4:19:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15597)|
| 4:19:57| I'm going to get to Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15597)|
| 4:19:58| She's been waiting the longest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15598)|
| 4:20:00| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15600)|
| 4:20:02| I want to make what Commissioner Overton said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15602)|
| 4:20:04| and also shared a death wish with you yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15604)|
| 4:20:07| I didn't walk, but I intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15607)|
| 4:20:09| went on Agnes to turn on Kingston Pike yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15609)|
| 4:20:13| And even the fact that Pelicans is sitting up on a hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15613)|
| 4:20:17| and there's a three-foot retaining wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15617)|
| 4:20:19| three, four-foot retaining wall there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15619)|
| 4:20:22| it is a literal death wish trying to pull out of Agnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15622)|
| 4:20:25| onto Kingston Pike at any point of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15625)|
| 4:20:28| I work in that area also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15628)|
| 4:20:29| And you can go at 10 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15629)|
| 4:20:33| or 5 o'clock in the afternoon and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15633)|
| 4:20:35| trying to turn out when people are going 50 or 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15635)|
| 4:20:38| from those minor roads to the major arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15638)|
| 4:20:41| I just, I would have to vote to approve the CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15641)|
| 4:20:47| for multitude of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15647)|
| 4:20:49| So I just wanted to put that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15649)|
| 4:20:51| that it's not just walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15651)|
| 4:20:53| It's trying to pull out on those areas of Kingston Pike as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15653)|
| 4:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15657)|
| 4:20:58| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15658)|
| 4:21:01| My final thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15661)|
| 4:21:02| I don't think we can all agree that this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15662)|
| 4:21:06| a perfect situation that really to accomplish the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15666)|
| 4:21:12| there needs to be different circumstances here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15672)|
| 4:21:15| to make this more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15675)|
| 4:21:18| However, I think that when it comes down to it, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15678)|
| 4:21:24| There's a lot of really good hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15684)|
| 4:21:27| for why it might not be appropriate for a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15687)|
| 4:21:31| to be within 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15691)|
| 4:21:34| But I don't want to get rid of the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15694)|
| 4:21:40| of the other CG districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15700)|
| 4:21:42| And for that reason, I think that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15702)|
| 4:21:46| would have a really good case at EZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15706)|
| 4:21:50| if they wanted to move the building beyond that 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15710)|
| 4:21:54| So I think in this scenario, there's a cemetery there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15714)|
| 4:22:00| There's a lot of things that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15720)|
| 4:22:02| could come into play that would make it appropriate for BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15722)|
| 4:22:06| So I really, because we don't have the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15726)|
| 4:22:11| on CG1, I don't think it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15731)|
| 4:22:15| And I'll even say that I don't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15735)|
| 4:22:17| think that it's appropriate for the other CG1 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15737)|
| 4:22:20| I think that those probably should have been something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15740)|
| 4:22:24| Well, we've already talked about all the CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15744)|
| 4:22:28| has flaws and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15748)|
| 4:22:30| So I can't support the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15750)|
| 4:22:33| But I do think that they would stand a really good chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15753)|
| 4:22:37| with a BZA application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15757)|
| 4:22:41| Well, one I also failed to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15761)|
| 4:22:45| that pushing the building up to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15765)|
| 4:22:49| is in conflict with the landscape ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15769)|
| 4:22:51| So that's another thing where I think there's an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15771)|
| 4:22:56| I think we all want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15776)|
| 4:22:59| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15779)|
| 4:23:00| But we've got 70% of this stretch already CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15780)|
| 4:23:06| So I think we need to ask ourselves as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15786)|
| 4:23:12| now how do you deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15792)|
| 4:23:13| Because are we going to have alternating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15793)|
| 4:23:17| Let's say we push 30% of these buildings to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15797)|
| 4:23:21| and we've got 70% back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15801)|
| 4:23:22| What have we accomplished then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15802)|
| 4:23:25| That's just rhetorical for everybody to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15805)|
| 4:23:29| I think we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15809)|
| 4:23:31| We have any more lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15811)|
| 4:23:33| No more lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15813)|
| 4:23:34| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15814)|
| 4:23:34| Thank you all for being attentive and patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15814)|
| 4:23:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15817)|
| 4:23:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15819)|
| 4:23:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15819)|
| 4:23:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15820)|
| 4:23:41| We've got three nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15821)|
| 4:23:43| So Commissioner Adams, Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=15825)|
