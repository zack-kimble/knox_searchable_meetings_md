| 0:02:09| So Big Ears was here. It was a pretty unbelievable festival. People came in from really all over the country and from outside of our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=129)|
| 0:02:19| I know Councilman Saunders saw some of the shows. I saw him there. Maybe some others did. I was at many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=139)|
| 0:02:27| As was our communications director. Anyway, lots of city staff I saw around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| But according to Rolling Stone, Knoxville is home to America's biggest avant-garde party. Who would have ever thought that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=152)|
| 0:02:40| It was really great. So we really want to thank Ashley Capps for all of his efforts that he and his team put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| And to the Aslan Foundation, they made a significant contribution to really make sure it was an awesome festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| Also I want to thank Visit Knoxville. They did a lot to support Big Ears and all of the events in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| And we continue to get, I know I personally hear from a lot of organizers and visitors about how great it is to work with Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| So we appreciate them, and we're getting into the festival season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| So they and our special events and our police and fire and public service are all going to be actively supporting the festivals and events that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=192)|
| 0:03:22| Also, of course, we had the Covenant Health Knoxville Marathon. I was there for the kickoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| And it was amazing to see close to 8,000 entrants. It was a great sight to behold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| Of course, the fire department had the American flag hanging from one of our ladder trucks. It was very special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| So we had, of those 8,000 entrants, we also had some of our own City of Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| We had three who ran the half marathon, Christy Branscombe, Patricia Robledo, and Eric Vreeland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=227)|
| 0:03:56| I think that deserves a round of applause for a half marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| Excuse me. And they all showed up for work on Monday too, so that's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=240)|
| 0:04:09| Also we had three relay teams with city representatives, and the relays are teams of four who each run six to seven miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| So those on staff who participated in that are Joe Walsh from Parks and Recreation, Keith Shields from Fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| Peter Ahrens from Plans Review and Inspections, David Brace from Public Service, also Public Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=263)|

| 0:04:36| and Rachel Butzler and Ben Davidson from Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| So they were on relay teams, and then also our urban forester, Casey Krause, was part of another relay team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| and his team finished first in the relay competition, and I saw him cross the line, and it was a sight to behold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| He was really running fast, and he was committed, you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| Anyway, congratulations to everybody who competed, and again to Knoxville Track Club, to Covenant Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| all the different sponsors, all the folks that made it possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| I did my part, I rode in the pace car, and I had a heated seat, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| It was quite nice, but it was great to cheer everybody on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| So ULI, you all know that after that busy weekend, we kept the momentum going into the week with our public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| on the Urban Land Institute report last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| We had a big turnout with many council members, about 200 people came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| and I'm not going to go into all the detail about what happened, but if you look on our city website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| you can see the presentation that Ann Wallace provided, and we had a lot of great feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| We'll be typing all of that up, and all those comments will also be on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| So please go there to find out next steps and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Cumberland Avenue, as you all know, work is about to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| We actually have the contract before council tonight, so pending that, everything will be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| But we know next Monday, on April 6th, contractors from KUB will begin utility work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| in the westbound lanes of Cumberland between University Commons and 22nd Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| So this is, I promise you, this will be a long and complicated project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| and we are dedicated to providing as much information as possible throughout the duration of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| Our communications team meets regularly with all of the other folks involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| to make sure we get the information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=387)|

| 0:06:40| Again, Thursday, April 2nd at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| At that meeting, we'll have city officials as well as representatives from the construction contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| KUB and Vaughan & Melton, and they will provide all the details about the construction timelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| the traffic patterns, road closures, and everything else people need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| As part of that effort, Vaughan & Melton also has set up a website, CumberlandConnect.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| Again, that's CumberlandConnect.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| That's a clearinghouse for information throughout the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| They'll also soon have an app that you can download to get alerts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| and keep track of the work as it progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=438)|

| 0:07:28| let's remember to still go and support the merchants along Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| They will appreciate the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| Next thing, Tuesday, April 7th, is the annual Mayor's Day of Recognition for National Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| which is an opportunity we take every year to thank our AmeriCorps volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| and our Senior Corps volunteers, which we have several hundred in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=467)|

| 0:08:11| Hope to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| The next day, Wednesday, April 8th, we will have another public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=492)|

| 0:08:32| And this plan, this Bicycle Facilities Plan, was developed after extensive public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| to set priorities for improving our local bicycle infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| The plan is also on our website at cityofknoxville.org slash bicycle plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| So anyone who's interested is encouraged to read the plan and come to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=529)|

| 0:14:29| Councilman Delevingne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| I do have some people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| This is a project that I think has wide support amongst the neighbors and the neighborhoods around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| Broadway Carpet wants to expand a warehouse off of Baxter Street and I've looked at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| and I think it satisfies the requirements of Article 7, Section 2 variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| It is a property that has as neighbors KCDC's repair shop across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| It has the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Behind it, it has the Love's Towers and there's a home to the north of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| Everyone has been consulted, as I understand it, and has agreed that this is not going to impact them and is a useful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| As a part of this, Broadway Carpet's option would be to put the warehouse on the Broadway corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| which really no one wants to see that piece of land used that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| And in conjunction with this project, Broadway Carpet, I think they're not necessarily connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| but it could be affected if we don't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| Broadway Carpet is donating or dedicating two sort of building lots on the corner of Caswell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=941)|
| 0:15:49| and Grotz for a community park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| And I know the community worked in the past to try to get Dow Chemical to endow some grant to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=951)|
| 0:16:01| That didn't happen, but Broadway Carpet is stepping in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| I understand they're going to give the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I think they're going to finance some of the plantings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| and the neighborhood is excited to roll up their sleeves and get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| So by approving this, we'll enable a warehouse to be slightly deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| It'll have a shorter setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| And that's really the primary thing on this, the changing of parking spaces from 36 to 32| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| and the other requirement, lot coverage from 50% to 58% or minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| In moving the property back, they will get rid of a nasty old, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| rusted iron curtain wall that serves as the back of the building and it'll be a masonry thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| They will move closer to Love Towers, but they're very far away from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| and not even near the driveway that enters the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| So no one's going to be really impacted and it's going to be a good use of a warehouse land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| and the salvation of property that can be better used on the Broadway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| I urge my colleagues to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| So I have two people who signed up to speak in favor of this appeal, Liz Upchurch and Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| So if you all would come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| I'm going to set my timer, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1042)|

| 0:17:45| We just want to say that we are in support of this variance appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| This is going to allow us to do that project that Councilman De La Vope discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| in terms of redevelopment on the Broadway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| It will help the greater community as well as our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| And so our board is supportive in conjunction with Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| And I'll turn it over and let you finish speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| Quick and brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1087)|

| 0:18:20| They meet with us once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| We've met 13 times now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| And they're working on a project to improve their property on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| The ONK board members voted unanimously to support Broadway Carpets' plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| and their variance needs at the Baxter Avenue property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| The plans and changes they have back up to the backside of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| at the back of Love Towers, which is a KCDC property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| And Art Cate has already spoke about his support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| So we appreciate Broadway Carpets reaching out to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| and letting us know what their plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| and working with us on their projects to improve their property on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| So we are much in support, and I regret that we didn't send our support to BPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| so we didn't have to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| But we're always glad to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1148)|

| 0:19:15| Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Okay, so we have a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1160)|

| 0:19:29| with East Tennessee Housing Development Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| to provide $40,000 in Home Investment Partnership Program funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| for operating expenses for the financial coaching program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1180)|

| 0:19:47| 11B is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| We do appreciate Broadway Carpets and how well they work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| and all the folks who came from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| That's really, I think, a great example of how the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| and the neighborhoods work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1200)|

| 0:20:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1229)|

| 0:20:46| Phases 1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Yeah, Mayor, I want to speak to this briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| I've had a lot of heartburn over this project just because I have a hard time as a simple person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| picturing jamming four lanes of traffic into two, and I know people have studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| I've had assurances from your staff, and I understand we're trying to enhance that Cumberland Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| I mean, it's a place that's used by thousands of students and visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| and I'm thrilled to see the streetscape improvements and tree plantings and the benches and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| I just worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| I just worry that we're putting ten pounds of traffic in a five-pound lane or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| I don't know what to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I have to trust in the professionals, but I must say it's kind of a puckering moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| As I understand it, Phase 1 will probably help improve the road capacity from the 22nd Street to the Alcoa Highway area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1304)|
| 0:21:54| and that sounds like a darn good thing to do no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Phase 2 is the one that puts, I guess, 16th Street to 22nd Street on a diet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| so that they can have one lane in each direction, a dedicated turn lane where you turn at the corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| but not through the interim driveways where businesses might have their entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| And I'm assuming that this is going to make this pedestrian-friendly, bike-friendly, and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1337)|
| 0:22:26| I just worry that as I picture that traffic pouring out of the hospital and Andy Holt and the University Commons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1346)|
| 0:22:37| and folks heading downtown that we're going to have congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| Maybe that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Maybe that causes them to jump on a bus, park their car and jump on a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| But I worry about moving the traffic through that area and constricting what was a road built for cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| I've heard you speak at the budget hearings that roads are for people and not cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| And, of course, this is done to enhance the area for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| So if you have someone that wants to speak to some of that, I guess we need some assurance that we're doing a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| I understand KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| I'm glad that you all rebid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| You got a lower price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| You got KUB doing some of the underground work that lowers the cost of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| and takes out some of the uncertainty that contractors face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| And it looks like you have a pretty decent bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| It's just a question of where are we going and what happens if it hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| Ann Wallace, our program manager for the redevelopment office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| would you like to address the hundreds of hours of public input and consensus that was built around this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Thousands of hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I guess I'd like to start by saying, first of all, good evening, mayor and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Ann Wallace, 400 Main Street, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| There have been literally hundreds of hours put into this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| There was a process even before the city hired a project manager for Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| to look at getting input and consensus building by all the stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| including the University of Tennessee, the merchants, the Fort Sanders Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| two regional hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| And while we are in a challenging situation of balancing a lot of competing interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| be that with the folks who participated as stakeholders, but also with the street itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| we have come to what we feel like is a very reasonable and appropriate solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| for a corridor that is currently not working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| We are shifting our focus from a corridor that is a cut-through street to a destination location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| We are expanding the urban amenities of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| the very exciting and wonderful investment that's been seen downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| We've already seen over $200 million worth of private investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| leveraged in the Cumberland Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| on the basis that the public improvements will be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| The consideration with regards to specific traffic concerns, I certainly have heard those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| and we have definitely looked at them from a variety of angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| One of the key things to remember in addressing traffic concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| is that currently there are nominally 35 curb cuts in a six-block area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| north and south of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| By including a road diet and a median to direct those left-turn movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| solely to the side streets, which are not included in that 35-number count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| we're literally reducing left-turn volume on Cumberland Avenue by more than 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| That means the free flow of traffic as you're moving from east to west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| will function in a more appropriate manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| and also combining that with improved traffic signals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| allowing for the right turn onto Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| so that free flow traffic can move out of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| We anticipate seeing Cumberland Avenue moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| in a much more successful traffic pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| while at the same time providing the aesthetic goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| and also the goals of reinvestment in an area that unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| has seen a lot of economic decline over the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| And so we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| I realize that this is a new direction and new things create some angst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| and we will have some challenges as we go through construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| but I'm pleased to say that we are setting the stage for great communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| helping people to understand what to expect and when to expect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| and I hope we can invite and hopefully see most everyone out at the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| at the mayor reference in our opening remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| which is on Thursday evening at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| All right. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| We've got more questions. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Yes. First of all, Ms. Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| I wanted to compliment you on your presentation last night at the ULI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| while you're down there, and we've had many, many meetings about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| but could you give, I know it's a major, major project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| but could you give a rough ballpark time of completion for this entire project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| if you could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Yes. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| As the mayor mentioned, the utility portions of the project will kick off Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| April 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| That will last approximately two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| and then the streetscape phase one portion will start June 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| and run through the end of this calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| so everything between Alcoa Highway and 22nd Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| we anticipate being completed by the end of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Phase two construction, the road diet section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| which Councilman De La Volpe referred to from 22nd Street to 16th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| is scheduled to be completed by August 31st of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Anne, thank you for chatting with me yesterday about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| and two things I learned that I probably have forgotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| but I thought it was important that you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| that the state had decommissioned Cumberland Avenue as a state highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| and how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| That seemed to be an integral part of it and something I'd forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| The state of Tennessee decided to go ahead and decommission Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| They were anticipating making that action once we completed the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| Given the timing and, unfortunately, some of the delays that we've experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| they did go ahead and decommission that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| In the last couple of months, we received notification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| and the state route designation has been moved to Neyland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| I think that's an important factor, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| It kind of addresses part of De La Volpe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| The other thing that interested me was the $17 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| There's a lot of unknowns on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| and it's probably been some of the angst of getting competitive bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| and there's been back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Just speak briefly a little bit about what you told me about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| how you're budgeting for change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| We see a lot of projects come through here that have numerous change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| You have to be anticipating change orders and budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| and you all have talked about that and planned for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| There's no telling what you're going to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| when you start ripping up layers of history there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| As we get handed these change orders from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| you all have talked about it and planned for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Certainly, and I think it's very appropriate that you use layers of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| The original document for Cumberland Avenue was titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Cumberland Avenue Quarter Study, A History of Connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| Truly, Cumberland Avenue has been a roadway since the late 1700s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| so you absolutely address a point that we will probably find things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| unexpected underneath the roadway, and we will be making best estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| and best knowledgeable assessments of those situations as we encounter them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| That being said, we did include a 10% contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| and the construction estimation cost, and then we have also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| you'll see later this evening, a budget amendment where we are pulling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| I believe it's $6,300,000 from what has been designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| to a Washington Pike project and moving it to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| That will give us some additional budget to be able to encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| or address any change orders that we might encounter early in the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| so we're not having to go back and amend the budget initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Of course, if we don't use it, that money can certainly be reverted back to Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| and we're pleased that when we were able to come up with a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| both projects are able to continue to move forward with their current funding levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| and the current processes that they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| So Washington Pike will continue through preliminary design and right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| while Cumberland moves forward to construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| and utilizes those construction dollars so that they're not at jeopardy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| if we were to see a rescission from the Federal Highway Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| That's good. That's a really good, great answer, and I appreciate you sharing that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you. Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you, Anne. You do a great job for us. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| with Vaughn & Melton Consulting Engineers, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| for professional construction engineering and inspection services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| for Phase 2 of the Cumberland Avenue Streetscapes Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| in an amount not to exceed $1,247,422.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Quick question, Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| What was the Phase 1 engineering budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I didn't see any reference to that, and I'd forgotten what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| I don't have that good a memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Anne, do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| All part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Yeah, Anne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| The Phase 1 construction engineering estimate was right around $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| That was approved back in the spring when we had split Phase 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| and were bidding that as a separate contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| So Phase 2 we decided to wait and address at the time that we had Phase 2 work under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| So $1.65 million is the design cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| It's the construction engineering cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| And construction engineering inspections is required by TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| as part of the Federal Highway Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| They have to be able to have an inspector on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| Make sure you get what you're paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Make sure you get what you're paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| I'm saying that's what their purpose is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| And as I mentioned to Councilman Wallace when we addressed this issue yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| one of the keys to construction engineering inspection services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| and having this as an outside contract is that it does provide checks and balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| so that we make sure that the materials that we're purchasing do meet TDOT's requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| and standards so that we don't end up with future maintenance issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| or failure of the materials themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| It also includes a budget for some PR as part of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| and that will help city staff be able to communicate clearly with the merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| and with the traveling public what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| And, in fact, Vaughn and Melton created the CumberlandConnect.com website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| as part of their CEI contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=1985)|

| 0:35:29| adopted by the City Council of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee, on April 20, 1954,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| entitled, A Resolution Providing for the Issuance of Water Revenue Bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| so as to provide for the issuance, if not to exceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2137)|

| 0:35:47| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| A quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Would you bring us up to date, Mark, on what's different from what we did before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| I don't quite understand why we're back again, but maybe is it just the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| or is there some other aspect of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| It is different bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| On March 3, the Council authorized a total of approximately $210 million in refunding bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| The proceeds of those bonds will refinance existing debt at lower interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| This is new work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| This is new work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| The bond proceeds for the electric water and wastewater bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| that are before Council's consideration tonight will be used to fund new capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| to each of those respective systems for our fiscal year 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| So in Step 1, you were saving interest on higher price debt you had by retiring some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| and now you're going to build stuff that we need for the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Each year we use a certain portion of debt to help fund our capital programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| We had initially planned to issue these bonds late summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| We accelerated the sale of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| That's why it's so close to the refinancing, because interest rates are so low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| And they might be going up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| We wanted to go ahead and take advantage of the historically low interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2213)|

| 0:39:13| and redoing it and buying a little life, but that's about the extent of my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| Why don't you give us a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Well, I'm not going to – I'm not an expert on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| On coatings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| On coatings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| So I can tell you that this is a repair that will significantly increase the life of the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2364)|
| 0:39:35| We expect that this will add roughly five to six years' worth of life before we have to replace it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| and it's much cheaper than replacing the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| So you're spending $80,000 now rather than $300,000 to yank out the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| 11N is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| to negotiate and accept from Hicks Plastics Company Inc. payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| with respect to personal property to be located at 1821 Mid Park Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| of the Industrial Development Board as defined in TCA 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Councilman Della, vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| We have Doug Lawyer from the Chamber and Tim Hicks from Hicks Plastic Company are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| and we'd like to invite them to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Yeah, I didn't know whether Bob Wetzel or these folks just want to crow a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| and talk about the fact that this is bringing jobs to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| We actually would like to crow about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| We'll let Doug Lawyer do the crowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| The Chamber's done a good job for us on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| We'd like for Doug to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Thank you for the opportunity to crow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| My name is Doug Lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| I'm Vice President of Economic Development at the Knoxville Chamber 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| I'm really excited to be in front of you all this evening with an economic development project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| We've got a manufacturing recruit with us that is working towards a capital investment of $10.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| and a creation of 200 jobs in the city limits in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| And that would be in Councilwoman Palmer's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| A couple of key things I'd like to talk about is, one, just that, manufacturing jobs in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| It's been a while since we've had a new recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| We've had a lot of great expansions recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| We had an announcement just the other day of a new logistics company opening up an office in downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| bringing 100 jobs, but this is bringing manufacturing jobs into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| This is taking a vacant building off of Middlebrook Pike up on Midpark Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| and putting it back into reuse and getting it cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| I'd also like to speak about the fact that this company is looking here because of another company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| that recently located here in our region up in Clinton, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| a Korean automotive parts manufacturer called SL America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| which was recruited to this region several years ago and continues to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| They just recently announced about 1,000 jobs up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| and now they're bringing their suppliers to the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| So it kind of plays very well with our Innovation Valley regional approach to economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| And then finally, before I introduce Tim to say a few words to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| I'd like to point out that this project is also on the 90 crosstown route with Knox Area Transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| so hopefully some of their employees can jump on one of our buses and get to work easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| He's got a couple of plants up in Michigan I'll let him tell you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| and it's my honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Doug is also a member of the Knoxville Transportation Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| We appreciate you tying transit and economic development together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Before you leave, are you going to tell us you've got the Volvo plant coming next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| We have a list of projects we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Mr. Hicks, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Tim Hicks, vice president with Hicks Plastics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Yeah, we're excited to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| I think we spent a lot of time looking anywhere from Ohio down to the Chattanooga area, Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2588)|
| 0:43:17| and to better serve SL America is why we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| and that's where I think it made the most sense looking at the outlying properties in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| I think we'll have the people we need, and it's a great location for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Yeah, we appreciate very much your investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| I enjoyed meeting with you previously when you were touring the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| and we're very, very glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| Okay, so we have Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Welcome to the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Little Brook Pike has two industrial parks, this one and another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| and I'm really happy to see this development occurring in this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| And as Mr. Lawyer pointed out, these are on the bus line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| and it makes transportation much easier because we do have industrial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| in areas where there is no public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| So this is a real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| So, again, welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| I'm glad you've come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| I want to ask you to look in the packet at different types of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| Can you tell us roughly what kind of salary, wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| those jobs that you're going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| There's going to be 200, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Yeah, it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Our history, we like to promote from within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| so we'll have jobs in the $10 an hour range and a starting range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| and work up to, you know, in the $100,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| But the manufacturing, we have basically a pretty good tier of maybe injection molding or decorating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2685)|
| 0:44:54| and then quality, maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| This facility is going to have a lot of new equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| so in a higher level of automation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| So we'll have a little less, you know, custodial type maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| but we'll have a little of a higher tech, you know, running that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| But it does vary, and our industry is really good for promoting from within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| and very technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| Well, thank you very much and welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Is there anything the local community colleges or schools can do to help you, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| train people for your industry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I mean, it's becoming harder and harder to find, you know, technical labor in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| But back in Michigan, we do network a little bit with the local community colleges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| and a little bit with the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| It can be challenging finding people that are actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| going to school for the technical jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| They really don't have a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| That's where we have a lot of luck from promoting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| young qualified people that are go-getters, you know, to really climb the ladder quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| I'll throw out a name for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| There's a gentleman named Michael North at Strawberry Plains who runs the Pellissippi College there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| and he's working with high school students, bringing them in and getting them started in college programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| specifically tiered and aimed at getting into the workforce rather than just a general education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| You might check with him and see if there's something that they can do to qualify people for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you, Mr. Hicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| You want to add anything more, Doug, about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| I think we covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Again, I appreciate the opportunity, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| certainly the question about workforce and training, you know, ties in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| We've got such great community colleges and College of Applied Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| and Knox County Schools and what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| and the Career Magnet Academy out there at Strawberry Plains has got an advanced manufacturing track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| that I think will be of great interest to Hicks and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2836)|

| 0:47:48| I think this got the biggest round of applause to have downtown bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| So here we are moving forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2872)|

| 0:48:19| Is Erin here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Erin, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| I'm going to set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| You have up to five minutes to speak, and please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Erin Downey, 6918 Westerly Winds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you for the opportunity to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| We serve you through a contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| I am the regional director with Rural Metro, and we've been your EMS provider since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| I have been in my role for approximately six months, but I bring about 20 years of industry experience with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| And one of the things I think that's crucial to me is ensure that we have transparency with all of our government bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| although we report directly to Knox County, and I have to tell you they have a very, very stringent contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| You have one of the premier EMS systems in the country here, and I have quite a bit of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| and it's exceptional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| But we serve you and we serve your citizens, and I want to be sure that you know that you can come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| to request any information you need or want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| We have exceptional response times, and I'm happy to share that at any point in time with the entire body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| or with you individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| And some things that we bring to the community, for example, as part of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| we just replaced 16 ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| This contract requires that we replace ambulances very early in their lifespan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| So we break them in and then we send them to other operations throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| So you do get the best of the best here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| We employ right around 500 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| That includes our part-time pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| Rural Metro paid in 2014 in this area, we paid about $15 million in payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| So it's a pretty significant operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| And these are facts that I think are important for you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| And again, I'm happy to share whatever information you need as you need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| So please don't hesitate to contact me whenever you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| What's your average daily calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Average daily calls run anywhere between 200 to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| We do about anywhere between 180 to 250 transports a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3043)|

| 0:50:48| And we usually try to recognize in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Would you like to come down and identify yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Yeah, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Kind of caught you off guard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Just tell us your name and what your troop is and maybe why you're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| My name is Buchanan Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| I'm with Troop 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| And I came here to complete a requirement for a merit badge involving going to a city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| and taking notes and then providing a report to my leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| So that's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150331?start=3084)|
