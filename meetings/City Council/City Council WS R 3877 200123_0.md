| 0:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| So, Councilmembers, we are here today having this workshop to discuss some items relevant to how we will, the process that we will use and the form and a few other items in the replacement process for our District 1 City Council seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=100)|
| 0:02:00| So, if you will, I would like for us to, I think everyone has received the ordinance and has had time to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=120)|
| 0:02:08| Are there any questions as it relates to the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Having none at this time, we are going to go ahead and let's take a look and review the First District Candidate Application Form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=134)|
| 0:02:24| If you will, it is pretty basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Candidates will be required to insert their full name, date of birth, current address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| They will have to list any addresses where they have resided in the past 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| We do know, per the ordinance, any candidates must have resided in the First District for 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=157)|
| 0:02:45| It also asks, do you currently hold any other elected public offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| If so, which ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Are you currently a City of Knoxville employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Ask for home number, cell number, work number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| They will be required to show proof of age, proof of residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| A member of the City Council staff will verify the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| They will list which form of identification was presented to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| any documents for residency, and then the name of the City Council staff person who reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| At the bottom, you will see that there is a statement that all candidates will attest that the information that they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=196)|
| 0:03:25| they have lived in the First District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| they are, they realize that they cannot hold elected public office unless they are at least 21 years of age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| and, again, that they have lived in the District for at least one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| They also further attest that by signing this form that the information they provided above is true and correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| There will, let me first say, are there any questions or discussion regarding the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| and the information that's being required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| I just had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| In thinking about the application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| it just dawned on me in thinking through this process that in order to run for an elected office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=252)|
| 0:04:21| you have to go and get a petition and get signatures, you know, in order to get on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| And so I was wondering within this process how we might be able to build in an aspect that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=267)|
| 0:04:39| uplifts the voice of the voters in this city and requires applicants to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| go through a bit of that process that we all went through, you know, to seek office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| That is a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| I know that that is not listed in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| I'm going to defer to our legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| First, let people know the First District candidate form is basically a form that's been around before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| This was a form used back in 2009, so it's just been updated a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| and it lists the criteria that are required by a charter or ordinance to run for office, as the Vice Mayor discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=318)|
| 0:05:27| In the ordinance, there is no requirement for a candidate petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| That does not mean that someone voluntarily on their own could submit one if they would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| but there's no compulsion under the ordinance to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=341)|
| 0:05:50| Counsel, do we want to have further discussion regarding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Is there any other council members that would like to discuss whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| or not applicants should pick up a petition and get signatures as they would if they were going to be on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=358)|
| 0:06:13| Having heard no further desire for conversation around that, this will be something that I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Council Member Parker, that we can table for further discussion in the future regarding our ordinance that's in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| That's agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| I might add, this replacement process also applies to people who would work in the City Council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=390)|
| 0:06:41| It would involve the recorder, the assistant city recorder, the internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| and my position as special counsel to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| If you wanted to add a requirement for people seeking an elected office petition, that could be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=414)|
| 0:07:03| but it would have to be broken out separately so it wouldn't apply to those governed by civil service or contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| Thank you for that point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| I'm trying to turn on my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| I don't think we finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| We're still on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| I like what Amelia is saying, what Ms. Parker is saying, to have something, some sort of input from the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=446)|
| 0:07:35| I know that we were elected, so we're representing our constituents, but still it would be nice to involve more people in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=455)|
| 0:07:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| What I will add to that is if the goal is to have input from the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| the voters are only going to sign their names on a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| They will not be speaking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| We'll get to that piece a little bit further down, but we could say that we want them to have a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| and at least 25, or I think for an election it's what, 40 or 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| It's 25, and those people are verified by the Knox County Election Commission that they're residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=499)|
| 0:08:28| that they're voters and they're residents of where they say they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| So if the desire is to ensure that people within that district are saying that they are attesting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=513)|
| 0:08:43| this person lives here, I know this person, and obviously if you sign someone's petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| you're saying that I support that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| So we very well could have further discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| Any other council members care to have any comment or further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| I just want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| I know historically speaking, I don't think it's necessarily a negative thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| but I know people have told me that they don't consider signing it necessarily a testament of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| I'm not talking about this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| I'm talking about all petitions when candidates run that they see it as a means of just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| yes, this person is eligible, because people will sign petitions for people who are opponents to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| That has certainly happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Trust me, I'm not going to sign an opponent's petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| You don't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| And I just, I don't mean to put Councilman Roberto on the spot, but I'm going to linger and give you a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| I'm a member of the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Is there any thoughts or any, to the historical purpose of it or anything, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| having served on the Election Commission, do you have any insight that we wouldn't have of that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=600)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Oh, you're so welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| I was actually trying to look up just then those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| My recollection is similar to yours in the sense that I think you're confirming that the person meets those criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=619)|
| 0:10:28| and you're not necessarily saying that they have your support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| because I think if you go back historically and look at petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| you'll find that they're signed by the same people sometimes, or at least duplicates, so that that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| And I certainly had that experience, too, where people would say, well, I'll sign that, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| I like the idea of what's trying to be looked at here with having some participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| and looking for petitions and signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| I think what our attorney had said was that, you know, that's really outside of what's in the ordinance currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| And if we were to use it here, Mr. Frost, would we have an issue because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| we're doing something extraordinary that is not in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Well, I think ultimately you would have to postpone your special called city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| until, you know, an ordinance got worked out and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| And then that means, I mean, Council Member Welch is resigning February 16th, like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=690)|
| 0:11:39| So that could, I mean, the agenda has been set for next week's council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| so there would be a period of time that that seat would be vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=706)|
| 0:11:55| and the body as a whole would be down a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| So I think those are valid points to take into consideration if we were to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| if council were to choose to incorporate this and to have a, would it be an amendment to the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| We would amend the ordinance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| Okay. So if council's pleasure is to amend the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| we would have to give consideration to the time frame of people being able to get those 25 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| My assumption would be we would ask election commission to verify those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=746)|
| 0:12:35| We'd either have to do it inside the city council office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| or we'd have to have election commission ask them if they could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| We had a member here, but I think they're not here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Mayor, my light's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Council Member Parker, did you have any additional comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| I guess that's a ghost light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| We're not in our usual seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| What I wanted to bring up was not, I don't, I'm not necessarily advocating for the 25 signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| like not that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| I don't have an alternative, but something that represents the voice of more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| Because as Ms. Rider was saying, anybody signs them, it doesn't necessarily mean support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| So if we're going to take the time to work out an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| I think we should try to figure out something else that will show people are supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| So if that's the case, if the intent is to show of support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| I think that each of us have already seen, have received e-mails, phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| people wanting to meet with us to speak to their support of candidates and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| And these are people, potential candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| because they have not officially had the opportunity to fill out an application yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| As we move on in our discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| we will talk about what this will look like as far as allowing supporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| to be able to speak on a candidate's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| So maybe that's better served where we want to have this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| for the sake of the timelines with Councilmember Welch leaving office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| And I think I'd like to recommend that we come back to the signature piece of it at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| But we will have conversation about supporters speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| And I think that would satisfy what the conversation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| But excellent conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Thank you for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| So if there's no additional objections to our conversation regarding the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| we will go ahead and we will proceed with the First District candidate application form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| as you have presented in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| We will not accept electronic applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| All applications will have to be hand-delivered to the city recorder's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| for the verifications that we spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| And everything that we are deciding today will be available online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| and information will be given to candidates as they pick up their forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| So, Council, we now want to have a discussion regarding whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| or not we would require a letter of interest and a resume with an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| or leave that to the applicant's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| What is Council's pleasure on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| My assumption would be that if I were applying for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| I would have a cover letter and a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| I don't know, do we want to make that a requirement or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| I'm a big fan of cover letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| And if you apply to a job that I'm on a committee for in my other positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| you rise to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| I'll put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| So I like the idea of a cover letter to give us a statement of why you're applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| and summarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| So I'm always in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| Any other conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Council Member Singh, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| This time I did not, but I am in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Yeah, the more information that we have stated succinctly, one might add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| because we'll get a chance maybe to hear from the applicants as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| but I would be for a cover letter and possibly a resume as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| I guess the question is whether or not we should require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| I think it would be helpful to each applicant to submit a cover letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| and a resume, and it would be certainly helpful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| I guess the question is whether or not we should require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| Well, why don't we, I think, let's meet in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| and say that a cover letter, letter of interest, or resume is desired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| is recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| And therefore the candidate can make that decision as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| or not they want to supply us with additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Very excellent point that when you are applying for a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| you want to provide the folks who will be making that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| as much information about you and why you feel like you are the best candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| for the position and qualified as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| So I think that any recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| if you will please make that note that we will have that recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| but it is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| But it is required that they have to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| and fill out the form in a timely manner by the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| They will have to come in and fill out the application in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| and actually we will have a discussion around the deadline for applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| I'm not sure that we're ready for that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| When we want to start accepting applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| I'm going to defer to you, Will, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| We'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| So we do know that we're going to have a discussion at the end of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| on when we will start accepting applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| and when they will be available for interested parties to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| The deadline for applications to be turned in will be February 10 at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| Again, all applications must be turned in in person by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| No electronic or faxed applications will be accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Is there any concerns or discussion around those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| When will the applications be available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| I know they're due the 10th at noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| but when will we have them available for the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| I think the expectation is Monday at the latest, this coming Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| and then possibly tomorrow based on further discussions to be had this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| If I have to change a lot based on that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| it may be Monday until I can have that ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Council members will receive packets on February 11 of all applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| and any information that they have turned in for us to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| in advance of the special call meeting for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| Council Member Testament?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Just to clarify, on cover letter, resume, letter of interest, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| needs to be turned in at the same time the application is with that deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| We can't require that, but that's highly recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Next, Council Members, we will have a discussion regarding the interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| We do need to make a decision as to what order the candidates who apply will be interviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| whether or not we want that to be an alphabetical order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| or if we would prefer that the city recorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| or our legal counsel were to draw names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| and announce those names as they're being drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| so our candidates will know the order that they will be interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| What is Council's pleasure on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| I like the option of drawing names to give it an impartial feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| and not put anyone at a disadvantage by their name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| and have it be a non-voting member doing the drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Or a non-voting, non-council member, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| Hopefully we're all voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| So what will happen on February 20th and as we're going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| and I will point out various items where non-voting members will be taking care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| and processing certain of these items, up to and including myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| will not be privy to a lot of the information until February 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Is everybody okay with drawing names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| So we will draw names based on our applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| that have turned in their packets by the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| As those names are drawn by the city recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| they will be announced out loud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| and then we will reiterate after our names have been drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| the order of the applicants being interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Next we need to have a discussion regarding the interview questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| that the applicants will be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Recommendation is that each council member submit one to two interview questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| and submit those to the city recorder no later than noon on February 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| The purpose of this is to make sure that each candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| has substantially the same questions asked of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| This kind of grew out of a, there was a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| it did not involve a replacement of a council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| but applicants were asked different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| A couple applicants were asked what they thought about a particular line in a Shakespeare play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| which wasn't really relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| So the purpose of this is everybody on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| the purpose of this is that it's a little bit like a League of Women Voters situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| You'll turn in the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| The city recorder and I will sit down and take out duplicates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| If someone, it probably won't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| if someone asks something totally irrelevant, we'll filter that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| The idea is that it's questions that are related to someone's ability to serve on city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| what they would think about service to the citizens of the city, and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| Now, that does not exclude a follow-up question on the day of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| If someone asks a question, just for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| how do you feel about the sidewalk paving policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| And the person, the candidate at the podium there says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| I think it should be expanded exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| So an appropriate follow-up question is, well, where do you think that money is going to come from in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| That's an appropriate follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| If someone answers, you know, about expanding exponentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| it shouldn't be getting on down the road of, well, what do you think about, I don't know, the price of tea in China?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1434)|
| 0:24:02| It needs to be focused job or council-related questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| So that's the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| We're trying to come in with a list of questions that all the candidates will be asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| absent the, you know, pertinent follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| So, council members, those questions should not go to anyone else on council other than the city recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| We should not be privy to each other's questions that we submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| Again, those are going to be required no later than noon on February the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Are there any issues with that date or that direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Again, as legal counsel stated, he, along with the city recorder, will take all of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| They'll review those and vet those for redundancy, for relevancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| And so they will kind of scrub those questions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| The next thing that council needs to make a decision on jointly is how many questions do we want each candidate to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| Because each candidate will be asked the exact same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| So we need to have some discussion regarding is that four questions, is that five questions, is that three questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| With the pleasure of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| I mean, if each member of council submits two questions and council member Welch won't be, I mean, that's, you know, eight times two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1529)|
| 0:25:39| I mean, that's the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| I mean, now, granted, some people will have some overlap, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| I don't know if somebody is going to ask, you know, a compound question where it actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| it's two or three questions within one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| But, you know, that's part of the process and how many, you know, I don't want to be tasked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| and Mr. Johnson probably doesn't want to be tasked with deciding, you know, ranking which questions are best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| because a member of council is not going to put forth a question that they don't think is important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| I mean, it might be a long night, but that might be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| I think you had said that we're not supposed to see each other's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| I would ask that we not share each other's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| I don't know if we would be able to do this when all the questions are submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| if we can all go in and vote on, if we decide on four questions or five questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| rank our top four or five and then put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| I don't think that we would have opposition necessarily to that, but we would need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| We would need to come in prior to the meeting to select the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| So let's get some more feedback and keep that open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I was just going to, I had other thoughts, but then I was going to follow up on what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| If somehow we were to do that, it would have to be publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| No, if we were to have some other gathering where we reviewed the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Oh, we could one at a time come in and then rank them or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Here's a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| So there will be eight of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| This is the crux of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| And if eight to 16 questions get submitted and then potentially there's some redundancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| and we say, you know, we're going to have to cap it at four to six, I think, in what's selected, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1668)|
| 0:27:57| I mean, there's no perfect solution to this, but one way to do it is to draw the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| just like you draw the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| You draw whichever four or six questions you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| If there's eight or there's 16, they go into a hat and they get drawn and those are the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| I mean, that's another way of going about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| All ways are imperfect, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| That's a good recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Council Member Testimone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Can we not set an earlier deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| So to Councilwoman Singh's point, I mean, I like the idea of ranking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| and see if we, by that method, come to a consensus of the top five questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| just for sake of argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| I think that seems a starting place, and then it may turn out that we might have to switch methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1726)|
| 0:28:55| to Councilwoman's right or suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| but it may flesh itself out if we're able to have a little more time to rank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Council Member Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I guess one concern I would have is that I think every Council member who submits a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| is going to think that that particular question is very important for them to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| If we then eliminate that question because maybe more folks think that's not an important question than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| then that Council member is prevented from getting an answer to a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| It might take for a longer meeting, but, you know, we've had longer meetings before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| I would say submit your questions and ask all the candidates the questions that are on the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| because we might inadvertently eliminate a question that somebody really needed to hear an answer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| to make a decision on a very important matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Council Member Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| I know and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| So when we went to forums, often we only had 30 seconds to a minute to respond to a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| if that's my recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| I certainly am jumping ahead, I think, in your agenda here, but I think it relays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| It's relatable because they don't need five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| Three should do the job, but we often had way less in our quote-unquote interview process to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1822)|
| 0:30:33| Valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| I do agree with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| It would make it a manageable session and everyone's questions would be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Put a time limit and then we'll know each interview is 45 minutes or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| So with that said, each Council Member will submit two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| I guess up to two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Up to two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| And then eliminate the redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| So there could be some that will be by default or basically along the same vein and will be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| So we are potentially in the position of having 14 to 16 questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| Potentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| If there's no redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| And that wouldn't eliminate follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| I mean, when we hear an answer, we could ask a follow-up question, as long as it was related and germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| So with that said, it sounds like the pleasure of Council is that each of us will submit one to two questions to the city recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1894)|
| 0:31:43| We will not share our questions with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| All questions will be vetted for redundancy and relevancy to exclude any duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| And each question will be read during the interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I guess we should figure out a time limit for the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Coming up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| So next order of discussion is the response time for each question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| It was suggested three or five minutes, but now that we are going to have a much higher number of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1938)|
| 0:32:26| potentially, I think we need to have some more in-depth discussion around the allotted time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1946)|
| 0:32:38| I'm going to recommend three minutes and go up or down on that, Councilwoman Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1958)|
| 0:32:46| Three minutes per response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| And they don't have to take that entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| We could cut it down, but it needs to be a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| I mean, I don't disagree with Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| I mean, three minutes is pretty long on a response, especially if we're doing a full number of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| I mean, I would propose a minute, 90 seconds max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1983)|
| 0:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| I'm all for meeting until 1245 a.m. again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| It's been a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| We miss those days, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| But if you did three minutes per question and there were 16 questions, because, again, these are all variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| that's 48 minutes per person, not including the asking time and any pauses or follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| So ballpark, we're pushing an hour per person, and we don't know how many the persons are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| That's X at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| So, yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| We've got a minute, quite frequently, to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| So what I will point out for Council's consideration is that I want to make sure that we are doing our due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2035)|
| 0:34:05| as these candidates will not have had the opportunity, as we did with this process of replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2045)|
| 0:34:13| to be on the campaign trail, to be able to get their messages out and participate in multiple debates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| so people can hear their thought processes and how they would govern themselves in this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2061)|
| 0:34:30| With that said, I'm not certain that a minute would be fair to a person who's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2070)|
| 0:34:39| that they are coming before this body and that we're hearing what they have to say in their thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| So I'm going to advocate, and not that I want to be here till midnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| but I think that this is so important that whatever amount of time that it takes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| that we're going to have to know those, we'll order pizza, whatever we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| to be able to give these candidates, however many there may be, ample time to be able to answer the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| us to ask them questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| So we are ensuring that we all are very comfortable and knowledgeable on the candidates in making our decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2107)|
| 0:35:16| because we are the voting body that will decide who will fill the District 1 seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| So with that said, if we don't want to do three minutes, and not every person will take the full amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| if we look at maybe a compromise at two minutes for questions, I'll spring for pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2127)|
| 0:35:36| I'll spring for pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| I think that two minutes is fair, but I'd like to get consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| I think two minutes is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| We're good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| And we may not have as many questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I mean, some of us have served a long time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Our questions may all be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| We may start thinking alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| So with that said, we will give each candidate two minutes to respond to whatever amount of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| Are you saying it's possible there will be two questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| We'll all submit the same two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Hey, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Stranger things have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| So two minutes per response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| They will be timed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Again, I want to note that no council member will be privy to the questions prior to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| with the course of action that we're taking, that all questions will be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| and only will be eliminated if that question has already been asked or submitted by another council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2183)|
| 0:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Again, interview questions will not be released prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| Are there any objections to that or conversation that we'd like to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Council, I am recommending that we allow each candidate an introductory speech of three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2205)|
| 0:36:56| And this is before answering questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| Is there any objection or any conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| I can't remember how much time we often had in forums to do an introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| Usually it was one minute or 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| I think it was like a minute or two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Maybe three minutes is too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Maybe two minutes is okay if that's for the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Do we want to go two minutes then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Well, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| I guess we're getting a little informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| But I do remember when it was shift from three to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| I liked the three-minute introduction because I could give a little bit about myself personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| and then why I wanted to run, you know, kind of a whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| With one minute, you really, there's not much you can cover in that minute introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| Very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| I was going to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| I think it was typically around three and then usually it was like a minute wrap-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| It ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I think that's where that minute came into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| I think we should go with at least three, you know, because it takes three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| A lot of these people have a lot of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| They've also got a lot of things they want to express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| So I don't think three minutes is too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Sounds like we have consensus that three-minute introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Also, we will have the interview questions will be read to each candidate by either our legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| or city recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Do you guys want to make a decision as to who will read the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| It looks like it's you, Will, by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| You just got nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| He pointed at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| So thank you in advance, Will, for being able to ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| So the next topic, and as I thought about this recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2323)|
| 0:38:53| let's say potentially we have ten candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| And ten candidates, I'm the tenth candidate or I'm at the very end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| and I've sat here and I've listened to every question that's been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| I've heard every answer that's been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| That potentially could give me an unfair advantage as I'm well prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| I'm much better prepared than the first two to three people who had to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| I'd like to make a recommendation and open it for discussion that all candidates who will be interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2359)|
| 0:39:32| be, for lack of a better word, sequestered in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| Therefore, there is no unfair advantage or appearance of unfair advantage to any candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| Can we have a discussion regarding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| I will point out that it is a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| If someone is bound and determined that's a candidate that wants to sit in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| and listen to all the questions, they're entitled to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| But, you know, you can request that they sit, that they don't sit in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2399)|
| 0:40:07| And so, again, as someone brought up earlier, when you are applying for a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2407)|
| 0:40:18| you usually take the suggested recommendations, as in the discussion about cover letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| I think if I were a candidate and I made that decision, if I were recommended to leave the room and I stayed in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| that would be noticed all and probably it would be noted, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| So what we will do is we will ask our candidates, once they check in here in the assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| once the meeting starts and we pull the names and we have the order that they will be interviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| we will ask them to leave the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| As we talk about making sure that we have a very, very fair process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| candidates that are asked to leave the room, should we ask them to not use their mobile devices during the interview time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2465)|
| 0:41:14| The Houston Astros rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2474)|
| 0:41:22| I could have a family member that sits in the room and listens to the questions and texts me the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| and potentially sends me the answers or sends me a video of someone's answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| and I can just sit back there and listen to it or put my phone on speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| and let me sit back there and hear everyone's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And so, again, not that anyone would do that, but I just want to make sure that this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| because it is so critically important in how we conduct ourselves in filling this vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2504)|
| 0:41:54| So, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| I would certainly, I think all of us want to have the most fair process possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| and if we're going to ask those who are applying to sit in another room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| so that they're not giving an unfair advantage to folks that go later in the draw than earlier in the draw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| I would think we'd also ask that they refrain from using electronic devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| that would allow them to do the same thing as if they were sitting in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| So, I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Any other conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| I was going to say, I mean, I think we're trying to be as impartial as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| and make the playing field, and this is how most interview processes in the business world are conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2554)|
| 0:42:43| Where I work, we ask the exact same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| We're not allowed to change a single word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| They have to be asked explicitly as they're written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| And everyone gets the exact same number and no more or no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| And, of course, you know, they're not interviewed at the same time, so they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| and they don't get the questions in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| So, that's the way that we maintain impartiality, and so I think that's a fair way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| So, I know, you know, this whole process is in our preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| and we're trying to do the best that we can with the task that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Council Member Parker, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Just one thing to think about is how it would work with breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| Taking a break, taking a bathroom break, taking a smoke break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Are we going to have someone in there, you know, following folks around to make sure they're not talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| You know, that's the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| And I've never been, I've never done jury duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| so maybe somebody who's done jury duty can give us some lessons from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| I've never been sequestered, but my understanding is if you are sequestered, you are accompanied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| If you leave the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| So, we would need someone to serve in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| I'm not sure this Council Office staff is prepared to follow them to the bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| Be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| I think that's very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| I think it's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| I think it's fair that you respond that way, and it's not fair that we ask those three staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| I think that we are dealing with people, if you're applying for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| everyone is mature, responsible adults that I think would follow our request as laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| So, I don't think that that would be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| I would recommend that if our questions seem to get up to, like, maybe over five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| we probably need to have pizza for the candidates as well that night, refreshments for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| So, Council Members, would you be in agreement that once a candidate has finished their interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| that they are allowed to stay in the Assembly Room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| I would agree as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Any conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| So, now, Council Member Parker, you had touched on this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| So, our next item for discussion is candidate supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| If Council wishes to allow a supporter or supporters to speak on behalf of a candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| I actually think that it is a good idea to allow supporters to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| I think at this point, are there any Council Members who disagree with allowing supporters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| The first thing, we'll talk about how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I just need to know that there's a general consensus that we would like to allow supporters to speak on behalf of a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2735)|
| 0:45:46| Is that a yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Yes, I'm definitely for maybe one, probably two supporters, maybe, to allow them to speak for a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2748)|
| 0:45:57| I think it's important because someone shouldn't have to just speak only for themselves as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| I think it's important that some people are allowed to have someone else to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| and kind of explain a little bit more about who they are that an individual person might be reluctant to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2770)|
| 0:46:18| I just think that to get an overall picture of the applicant, it would be good to allow them to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2778)|
| 0:46:27| I'd say, two people if we have time to come in and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| So, Council, are we in agreement for supporters to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| I think that we all are in agreement to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| So now we need to have a discussion on how many supporters would be allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Would we limit it to one or would we like to allow two supporters to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2805)|
| 0:46:54| I'm hearing two from Council Member Thomas and seeing if no one objects, we're going to go with two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2814)|
| 0:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| So we will allow two supporters per candidate to speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| We now need to have, my recommendation is that they would be allowed three minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| Are we in agreement or do we have sufficient time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| Is it too much time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| We agreed that their intro was three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Intros will be three minutes and then their supporter will be able to, will have two supporters per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2843)|
| 0:47:32| And each supporter will have three minutes to speak on behalf of the candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| And what did we agree on for minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| They were allowed to answer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Three minutes or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| We've got a timekeeper over there, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Council, are there any items that we've already discussed that you'd like to go back, any points of clarification or additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2876)|
| 0:48:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| The help here with the flow of this special call meeting, because we're talking about candidate, basically a stump speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| supporters, drawing names out of hat for questions, interviews, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| I'm just throwing out a suggestion here so it will help everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| Maybe at the beginning the candidate gives their stump speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2906)|
| 0:48:35| Other people can be present and then they have the supporters make their speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| Then that helps everybody familiarize yourself with the candidate if you hadn't heard from them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| And then we draw the names for the interview questions and then start interviewing one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2926)|
| 0:48:54| I mean, that's just an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| So, Council, what order would the candidates be allowed to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| Because we were drawing the names for interviews afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| We could draw the names from the beginning if you all wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| That might be best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| It seems like each interview is going to be almost an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| So I like what you were saying, what Mr. Ross was saying, to go ahead for people who are going to go home and go to bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2959)|
| 0:49:28| just so that everybody does get a chance to hear everybody and familiarize themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| I was wanting to clarify in that first part, is that when the supporters are talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| Supporters will speak before the interview questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| Before the interview questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| That's an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| You might have the supporters speak after all interviews are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| Oh, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| You might wear out the supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Well, I think that it would be good for us to hear from the supporters so that kind of we can take notes there that will kind of level set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3002)|
| 0:50:10| and know what to expect from those candidates potentially in their interview questions if supporters are allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3010)|
| 0:50:19| Similar to the interview questions, I think after the interview questions, we should at that point be ready to go into the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3019)|
| 0:50:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Did we settle on the order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| So what will happen is the first thing that will take place is that names will be drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| As you draw the name, that name will be spoken aloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| We will record the order, and then the order will be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| From that order, each candidate will come up and be able to give their introduction, which will be three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3050)|
| 0:51:00| After all candidates have given their introductions, candidate supporters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| and I do think that we need to ask the candidates to go ahead and sign their supporters in so we have a record of who's speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3065)|
| 0:51:14| We know if each candidate has one or two supporters speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| The supporters will be allowed, is that three minutes or is that two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| After the supporters have spoken, we will ask the candidates to please leave the room and go to the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3089)|
| 0:51:38| We can have a table in the back of the room where they could leave their electronic devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| Candidates will be called in in the same order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| Once a candidate has finished their process, their interview questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| they will be allowed to stay in the room with their electronic devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| Once the last candidate has completed their interview questions and council has completed all questions for each candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| that is when we will then go into the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| I will add that whoever the successful candidate is at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| that person will be sworn in at the end of the meeting on February 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| and they will officially be a member of this council representing the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Do we have any questions, additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Having heard none, we will call this meeting adjourned at 622.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| I'm sorry, no one signed up for public forum, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| We will call this meeting adjourned at 622.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Thank you all, council, for being here and for those in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877200123?start=3171)|
