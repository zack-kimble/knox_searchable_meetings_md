| 0:03:54| ends into Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| It's a semi-undeveloped site, so it's important to explain a few logistical details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| First of all, if anyone in the audience or watching at home on CTV wants to attend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=243)|

| 0:10:28| I just wanted to take a moment and just share with everyone about an event that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I'm sure everyone is aware of Second Harvest Food Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| They actually have a partnership with Great Schools Partnerships and our community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| where they actually provide backpacks full of food for children at those schools on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| weekends where they will have snacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Well, last Thursday, they were at Maynard Elementary School, along with Redeemer Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| and several folks from the community, and they opened the first food pantry at a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| This is a food pantry that will be open year-round for families to be able to come in and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| food for their families throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| And so, hopefully this will be the first of many, but it was actually a wonderful event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| and there were actually families who had signed up on Thursday to actually go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| Maynard's principal, Dexter Murphy, found a supply closet and turned it actually into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| a food pantry with a freezer that was fully stocked, and this was made possible by a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| from Morgan Stanley through Second Harvest Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| In addition to that, the Rotary Club actually made a little library outside full of books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| and so that was introduced as well, and so I just wanted to share that because a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| of people were not aware that something that wonderful is actually happening in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| So I wanted to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=714)|

| 0:12:31| there, so I hope to see some of you at that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=751)|

| 0:19:56| at just about every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| He sat right over here, and he always had his hat with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| The next two items on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| the appeal items, I suspect Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| would have been involved in one, maybe both of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| but he would have certainly been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1213)|

| 0:21:03| There is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| If not, all in favor, indicate by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1265)|

| 0:21:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1269)|

| 0:21:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| 10B is a resolution approving an appeal by Brian Ewers of a decision of the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| Zoning Appeals to uphold the determination of the Director of Plans Review and Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Inspections that the submitted design for a proposed dwelling at 2304 West Blount Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| is a three-story building, first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Before we get into discussion on this item, I am going to ask Mr. Ahrens to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| and give us some information about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Just to provide a little bit of context for those listening and watching, the zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| allows a maximum building height of two and a half stories or 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| The proposed dwelling is less than 35 feet, but a half story is what's in question tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1317)|
| 0:22:07| I went back to Miriam Webster's definition and it's the uppermost story which is usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| lighted by dormer windows in which a sloping roof replaces the upper part of the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| I looked at the proposed design and it didn't meet that definition and relying on my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| in construction, I think of a half story as like the uppermost story of a Cape Cod where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| it's under the roof, not necessarily bounded by vertical walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| So that's kind of it in a nutshell and I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| Thank you, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| There may be some as we work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| So just so council will understand the nature of the appeal, the chief building official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| has made this interpretation and what is being appealed is that interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| So the appellant says that what they have proposed fits within the two and a half story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1376)|
| 0:23:04| limitation and the chief building official has interpreted it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| So it's up to you as council members to make a decision whether that interpretation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| a decision that you want to live with in this case or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| And the appellants now are going to make the case on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| The appellant is here and has signed up to speak and so unless there are questions from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| council, we would ask Mr. Ewers to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| If you would please give us your name and address and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1413)|

| 0:23:59| this one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| I guess there, I went to look for definitions in the planning, zoning, there are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1442)|
| 0:24:11| There is not a definition in the building code either, the IRC, International Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| I proposed alternate definitions myself that I found online, one from, in the packet, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1459)|
| 0:24:28| from the planning director for Denver, Colorado and the definition was less than 50% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1468)|
| 0:24:39| square footage of the floor below of occupied, enclosed, conditioned, habitable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1479)|

| 0:25:15| You have Thompson Bowling on one side and Nalin Stadium on the other and she's a UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1515)|
| 0:25:23| alumni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| So it was purposeful where she picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| I want to make it clear, I don't necessarily disagree with Peter's definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| I'm asking for, I guess, an expansion or elaboration on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| You know, a gable pitch roof is one roof form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| If I was presenting a flat roof modernist design, would that mean that I couldn't put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| a half story on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| In this case, it's a quasi-traditional design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| It's a low pitch roof, but again, half of it is enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| The rest of it is just open roof deck overlooking the river, as I had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you, Mr. Ewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| There may be some questions of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Council, before I ask for a motion, if there is any discussion, we need to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Go ahead and ask your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| So, it's 30, just tell us what the wording is exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1592)|
| 0:26:44| Is it, it's 30, it's no higher than 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| And two and a half stories, or does it have to meet both of those criteria, or one, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| It has to meet both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| It's a max height of 35 feet, which we comply with, and two and a half stories, which again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1617)|
| 0:27:05| the argument I'm putting forward is we do meet that intent of the planning, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| the massing and the height restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| But it does have to meet both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| So, it's a single family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Are there other residents nearby, close by, across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| What's the density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| It is single family residence, zoned in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| It's, you know, the residences nearby is, you know, it's within that future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1649)|
| 0:27:38| of the, you know, south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| And so, this is really kind of the, I guess, the first house on, new house on the block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| that will, you know, meet the requirements of south waterfront design intent, in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| honesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Mr. Ahrens, do you mind coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Can you talk a little bit about the form-based code and the district that that's in and sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| of what that means when we're talking about form-based code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| So, that is the SW1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| It's the lowest density in the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| It goes from SW1 to SW6 or 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| That is the only single family district in the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| Form districts, we review not just for the use of the structure, but also what it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| like as far down to as the types of materials used for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1719)|
| 0:28:48| And so, there's a review committee that's made up of city staff, planning staff, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| fire, everyone has a chance to look at it and we do use the form district as our guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1735)|
| 0:29:04| as we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| There's a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| And so, as Councilman Wallace was asking, it is 35 feet and, which I interpret as cumulative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1746)|
| 0:29:15| two and a half stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| It goes through the review process, they get approved, and then it moves on through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| rest of the building permit application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| So, just to make sure that I understand, part of the intent of the form-based district is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| around the aesthetic of the buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| We are concerned about how structures look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I guess my question might be for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| There's a letter in here, I guess, from Mr. Uwers that states that in the proposed recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| the two and a half story requirement is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| No, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| The South Waterfront Code is being incorporated in its entirety with no changes into the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| So, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| The height limits, the other standards, and so forth in the South Waterfront Code will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| remain unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| In any of the drafts, were they removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| They were not removed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| In one draft, they were, I'll say, somewhat piecemealed in that the definitions were put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| in the definition section and some of the administrative provisions were put in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| administrative section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| In the latest draft, the South Waterfront Code and the Cumberland Avenue Code are, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| their entirety, in one part, placed in Chapter 7 of the proposed code, and it's in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| entirety without any section being put in what some may consider a more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| location in the code, but they're all put in one place in the new draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| Do you have any interpretation of what, I guess, I mean, essentially what this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| is, what is a half story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| And, I mean, I certainly don't know what one is, and it seems pretty vague, and it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| like the intent of the code was about height, you know, and so that's what I'm wrestling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| I don't know what 35 feet is, but a half story, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| I think there's certainly an argument that it is a half story in terms of what it's compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| to, you know, and I certainly understand Mr. Aaron's interpretation that it's a half story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| would be in a roof, you know, with a dormer, so I'm sort of, anyway, I'm wrestling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| this and, you know, I didn't know, I saw that in the letter, and so I didn't know if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| change had been addressed, but do you have any opinion on what a half story is, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| this is a half story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| I tend to agree with Mr. Aaron's, I would think of a half story, a bungalow-style home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| where the roof covers a lot of that story with vertical walls, as he stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| I think the question I have is, when you head up on why did the South Waterfront Code, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| I was not here when the South Waterfront Code was developed, why does it have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| provision of a height and feet, which we're all used to, but also includes a two and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| half story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| It seems confusing somewhat that both those two and a half stories and 35 feet, when most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| codes try to make it simple with just a height limit measured in feet as opposed to the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| of stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Right, I mean, to me it seems like it's, meaning the height limit is really the intent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| code and, you know, I think trying to decide, in my opinion, trying to decide what is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| half story, I think we should defer to the, you know, the parcel owners that's getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| ready to what appears to make a significant investment in the parcel, and I'd hate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| stop that, you know, over, you know, I think what's a pretty good argument is a half story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Councilwoman St. Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| My feeling is that it's under 35 feet, that's, to me, the important part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| The definition is an interpretation, and it's an interpretation with the idea that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| a bungalow style building, and it isn't that, so there's no way that it could meet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| specification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| It's not a full three stories, so to me, if this is an interpretation, we need to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| the loosest interpretation to support the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| So I really appreciate this conversation because it's a good opportunity to kind of revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| the process that went into developing the form-based code district in the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| which was a very significant community process that intended, and it was our first use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| form-based code in the city of Knoxville, and it really was intended to help shift us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| from thinking about land use by, you know, commercial, residential, sort of that categorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2067)|
| 0:34:36| of land use, to really the aesthetics of the area, and having sat through a lot of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2076)|
| 0:34:44| meetings and participated in that process, I can tell you that the primary rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2084)|
| 0:34:55| for that particular standard is around aesthetic, and so if, I mean, if you look at the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| aesthetically, it looks like a three story building, and so that wasn't the intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| The form-based code was really intended to, I mean, whether we agree with it or not, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| was the community process that was set forth in the code, and so if the intent was to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| an aesthetic, and the aesthetic of the design that's been submitted, it looks like a three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| story building, I would just say, as a representative of the folks who live in that district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| who participated in that process, it does not meet the intent of the form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| regardless of whether I like the structure or not, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Councilmember Berto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Mr. Ewers, is there any difference in the height in the different, you know, these stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| that we're talking about right now, the definition of story, you know, our ordinance is the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2158)|
| 0:36:07| of the floor to the next level where the roof or the floor would be, is there any difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| in each of those, you know, areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| The main level, the ground floor, let's call it, is about a ten foot ceiling, then it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| to a nine foot ceiling on the bedroom level, and then the roof deck, you know, the covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| roof deck area, I think we're at about eight feet, again, that was purposeful in getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| under the height restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Okay, so each of the different levels has a different height to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Mr. Ahrens, I had a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| Is the building that you're looking at here a three story building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| In my opinion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Is there, what I could tell from the image was it looks like maybe there's an elevator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| or stair in the center that's, you know, kind of enclosed, and then outside of that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| open space, like a covered porch type of thing, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| Yeah, I think there's some living space on that top floor, I'm not, I don't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| the plans exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| There's a, well, yeah, circulation, elevator, stair, and then there's also a restroom and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| then a small kitchenette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| If, I'm just trying to, since we're trying to figure out what a half story is, if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| area where the elevator was was covered, and maybe the kitchenette that you were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| about, if that by itself had a covering, and the rest of it was open to the air, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| it still be a, would that be a two and a half story, or a three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| I think this is where you're going, and I don't want to design, but if the roof structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| extended all the way down to the upper, to the ceiling of the second floor, I would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| it a half story, but because there's vertical walls that are eight feet tall, and the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| structure for that upper story, or that upper level, rests on those, versus down at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| top of the second floor, that's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| So it's kind of like if you had a bonus room, but there's no change in the roof, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| your walls are angled, that would be a half story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I'm working with my traditional interpretation of story, and I do recognize that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2322)|
| 0:38:52| new interpretations that come, and building design changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| I'm stuck with the wording that is in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| Well, I think this was a split decision at BZA, and I think it was three to two, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| so obviously there are different interpretations of what we could be looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| I do think it was important to note the difference in the heights of each of the stories or floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| that we're talking about, and your point about the angles of the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| I think in this particular instance, I'm going to go with what the neighborhoods have obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2371)|
| 0:39:39| said about the aesthetics, although I can see why you might have differing opinions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2379)|
| 0:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| I just want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| We keep sticking on the word aesthetics, and I actually want to talk about form and mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| I wasn't a part of the conversation about the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| The whole, in historic preservation and our historic guidelines, if you get a national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| register designation, it's all about form and mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| I know people feel like we're trying to tell people how to aesthetically design, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| certainly don't want to necessarily be in a position of telling architects how to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| I don't pretend to be one, but form and mass is what it's about, and I believe that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| they were trying to do with the form-based code, and that is based upon you have an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| of existing homes with some empty lots due to, as time passed, things got demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| and torn down through no fault of their own, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| It's about what goes back in to create the harmony and the balance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| Certainly the design is not offensive, but that's the intent of the code, is for mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| and form, and that's how it's worded in historic preservation circles, which is what I'm familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| To meet those mass and form and reflect what is the existing community there is where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| two and a half story come from, in my understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| I'm going to have to support the community's decision to pass the form-based code with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| the two and a half for that mass and form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| I will say, I had heard little bits of chatter about this before I opened my agenda packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| and the first thing that I saw when I look at this is, oh, there's a three-story home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| As we further look through the packet and read what was discussed at BZA, I'm like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| no, that's three stories, because I'm going to have to defer and agree with Mr. Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| that the roof being at the top of the wall of the third story, whether it's enclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| space or not, no matter where those interior walls are, those pillars are still constituting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| a third story level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| The ways to change this, I don't want to step on your design, it's lovely, it's just that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| you've chosen a lot that's in an area that designated they wanted to keep the form and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| mass of two and a half stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| So it would be a different design to make this two and a half stories and be under 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| So that's the intent, as I understand it, and I'm going to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| So I just, point of clarification, so if there were no roof on the top of this structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| which of course that would mean that there would be no kitchenette, no bathroom, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| and it was just an open rooftop, would it be acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| We'd call that a two story structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| I'm ready to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| So having reviewed the record and the BZA decision, I agree with the chief building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2568)|
| 0:42:56| official's interpretation of the code and therefore move to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| So if you vote yes, you are voting to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| We're going to need a roll call on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| Mr. Johnson, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2598)|

| 0:43:35| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2615)|

| 0:43:37| Seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2617)|

| 0:45:07| Six approximately six acres that are facing Strawberry Plains Pike are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| zoned c6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Primo's has a contract to sell this property to a trucking company that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| requiring that that front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Six acres be rezoned i3 because under the c6 zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Trucks is prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| The site plan for the property under the new owner would have primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| employee and visitor parking within that six acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| piece of this property, but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| That from time to time they would need to park trucks in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| and so that is why they have required as a condition to closing that it be rezoned the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2755)|
| 0:46:03| Staff NPC staff recommended the rezoning, but it failed by a vote of seven to six and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| The primary reason cited was the concern that there would be a lack of screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| Under the i3 designation that is otherwise provided for in c6, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2776)|
| 0:46:24| Primo's is willing to have the rezoning conditioned on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| There being you know, whatever is deemed to be adequate screening in landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| But this is necessary in order to complete this sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| Along the back of the tract there is a stream and some wetlands and so in order for this facility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| Be constructed on this property. It's necessary that they have access to this front six acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| We believe it's a worthwhile project. Obviously, it's good for my client in completing the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| But it would also bring in a good company that would be ready to start constructing on the property right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| with a facility that we think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| Area would really benefit from and I will just add one other item that many of the properties surrounding this particular track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| already allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Truck property there are three truck yards and one truck stop in the immediate vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| So we're not asking for something that's unique to this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| just that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Particular tract be all covered within the single designation of I-30. Okay. Thank you very much, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| Stay close because you somebody may have some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Now there are three people who have signed up to speak against this item. The first is Destin LeBlanc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| If you would please give us your name and address and you have up to five minutes. My name is Destin LeBlanc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| I live at 1609 Wisteria View Way. I'm in a condominium complex. That is right next to the TBI building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| that's down from the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Several things about this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| One is that the access to the truck terminal is going to be on a two-lane section of straw planes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| if you take a look at what the map is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| there's a section of straw planes, that's four lanes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| that section of four lanes has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Turning lanes into the various truck terminals that are there in addition to the four lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| There is a left turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| Left turn lane on southbound to go into truck terminals there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| at the at the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| The site plan that's given by Estes or Primo's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| is for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Entry into the truck yard to be on a two-lane section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| There's already significant truck traffic on this two-lane section because of truck terminals on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| John Sevier Highway and Forks the River Industrial Park those trucks that are used that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Straw Plains Park do travel through they're not turning off and on okay, so here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| We have a proposal that says we're going to have trucks turning on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| The truck terminal and we're going to have trucks turning out of it on to a two-lane portion of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| So that is a significant difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| Will point out and then in the staff planning report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| They did talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| that because of the i3 classification that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| Primo's and Estes wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| That it talks about uses the i3 uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| Do not depend primarily on frequent personal visits of customers or clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| I don't know how often trucks would come in or out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| But there are a hundred parking spaces for employees in that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| The staff planning report also said but these usually require good accessibility to major rail air or street transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| Routes, and I don't think that a two-lane road turning in turning in and off in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| Into a truck terminal is a appropriate transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| I've also note that the staff planning report had estimated traffic impact not required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| I don't know if you're not required is it is it wasn't required or they just decided not to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| But particularly because of the nature of this truck terminal to be at a two-lane portion of Straw Plains. It's not appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3035)|
| 0:50:44| The other gentleman just mentioned the issue about there being other truck yards in the area and that's true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| There are other truck yards in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| But if you take a look at the map, and if you take a look at a visit to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| You will see that all the trucks that are parked in those three truck yards are parked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| Significantly back from Straw Plains roads in fact they are they are not any closer than what the current 30 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| IC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Classification is for the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| I'll also mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Wherever you are also said that the six and a half acres will be used for an employee parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| on the preliminary site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| It's big bold letters the six and a half acres to be used for employee parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| If you actually take a look at the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| There are a hundred spaces for cars, but there's also an equal amount of area that's devoted to truck parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| So I'm not quite sure why there was a need to emphasize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| But it does sound like there should be more transparency in terms of what they're actually doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| The other thing that I would suggest is that if Estes or Primo's land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| Want to use this 30 acres, which is currently I3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| If they want to use it sir you've got about 45 seconds left if they want to use it for truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Terminals then they can use it for truck terminals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| And they can negotiate with Thermo King or one of the other companies that has access off the four-lane section of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3140)|
| 0:52:28| Straw Plains, and they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| They can take their trucks and bring them around the back and get on to the acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Now is it going to be slightly less use? Yes, that's a possibility, but it is going to be a better use to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| Yeah, finally. I'll just point out that in terms of the issue about having trees planted in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| That's not something that was important for the for the Planning Commission. That was something a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| By the staff and so the Planning Commission was aware of that recommendation. Thank you. Thank you so much for your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| Next is mr. Dale Roten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| Once again, mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3188)|

| 0:54:32| They tried to promote the use of one low-density housing mid-density housing. Well. There's two new condo developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| There's three little subdivisions going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3279)|

| 0:54:59| zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Now this gentleman. I know they bought this property in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| 2013 it was zoned I-3 in the back at that time and C6 in the front at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| Yeah, the C6 in the front is normal property up and down that highway. There's a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| He calls truck stops one truck stop of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Truck terminals one is 1,250 feet back the gravel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| With big trucks, and it you won't believe the dust that that it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| But that's what part of trucking terminals do the other side is a very neat place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| from the center of the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| It goes back 250 feet before the fence and the trucks are parked behind the fence and a barrier, and it looks really nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| On this particular site if you went 250 feet back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| This property is six and a half acres. It goes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| straw Plains back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| 1,074 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| The depth is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| 263 feet deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| There's not any room there for a buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| They were I don't know why they require that commercial property that was when they purchased it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| I do the due diligence that probably understand that that was C6 for a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| Because I bought the C6 across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| And when I do an industrial absolutely not this road is 26 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| Pavement is 26 feet these would sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| Where these truck terminals are there's two on that side a south side of course pilot truck stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| The pavement paved area is a hundred and fifty feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| And a six lane or five lanes at a hundred plus feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| This is 26 feet wide. I mean, I don't know how the world expect to get a 60 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| Trailer and 20 foot truck to turn on a 26 foot wide surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| I bought a piece of property across the street next to TBI building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Even the little road that goes between the TBI building and that piece of property is bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| Larger than this main two-lane highway. It is so narrow and so dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Noticed in the I know we haven't got much time. I noticed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Appeal it said that there had not been any major changes in development. Well, you have one minute. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| I definitely disagree. You you look you've got probably 300 new residents in sight of this terminal that they're willing to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| Now, I know there's not one thing you can do about the back part of this property 30 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| They won't build industrial. It's been there for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| But the front part of this needs a buffer like these other truck internals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| The minimum has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| 250 feet from the center of that road if you went all the way to the rear of this parking lot to be 290 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| So all this property is right next to the road and in the trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| The parking every one thing else at least is nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| They didn't they need a buffer and like on the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| The buffer is a commercial property in front like this is except it's got an Arby's on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| Well, there's plenty of places for fast foods or for shopping centers or grocery stores or something that these neighborhoods were really used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| But this is something that I urge you to agree with MPC and to deny this fear. Thank you very much. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| Broden next we have Cliff Honaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3500)|

| 0:59:11| wetland now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| I've been in discussions with several regulatory people over the last few weeks and I just discovered that that wetland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| according to an official at TDEC is the largest wetland in Knox County to his knowledge on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3560)|

| 0:59:52| wetland on our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| The carrying capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Hey, I'm really glad that he mentioned about the other truck terminals and his argument is hey, we got this truck terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3596)|
| 1:00:04| We got that truck terminal. So what's one more truck terminal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| Well, what we have is a flood zone that goes into a wetland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| And I'm afraid to tell you that there has been some unregulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3613)|

| 1:00:33| Instead of having the usual four to five feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Space where the water is only about a foot deep these damp these beavers. Sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| I can't say it right these beaver dams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3644)|

| 1:03:09| Inconsolate in line with what y'all talked about the very beginning the mayor's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| We're on the gateway of the water going into Knoxville these wetlands were why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3794)|
| 1:03:23| The founding fathers were there because they were wildlife magnets. Let's preserve them. Thank you very much for your comments. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| Honaker, thank you. Now. Mr. Brock. You have a two-minute rebuttal if you choose to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| Once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Again, please watch the clock up there and you'll see I hope you will see two minutes in just a minute. I'll be brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| Thanks vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| I'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| I'll just say that under the current designation we can do a truck terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| All the properties around this track or a lot of the properties around this track are truck terminals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| Because that is what this particular area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| Well suited for and so it stands to reason that a trucking company would want to buy this track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3849)|
| 1:04:17| So whether it's this truck terminal or another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| on the existing zoning that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| That that is likely inevitable. I will point out also with respect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| Water issues we do still have to comply with TDEC requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| So there's going to be other reviews beyond this that we will have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| Go through and make sure that we comply with and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| You know with respect to the argument about not being room for a buffer and for trucks to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3889)|
| 1:04:56| I'm not an expert on that but those who are we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| again willing to submit to the screening and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| landscaping requirements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| We think that that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| really what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| Designation was designed to to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| But not to prevent the the use of this this tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| as we have been proposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| To use it for in the hands of the buyer. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| Thank You, Mr. Brock now council there is discussion councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| Yes, I'd like to call on director green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| I'm a couple of questions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| I'm trying to understand why the c6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| this parcel started as c6 or I shall say it became c6 at some point in history and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| Then apparently in 2006 it got split with the c6 buffer remaining at the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| And the i3 which was before I was up here and was before you were at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| It helped me understand why all these other areas that I'm looking here at the aerial on KGIS that have trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| Why do they have trucks and c6 in these other places closer to the interstate? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| Have no idea. Is that allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| Have been and mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Aarons may want to opine on this also if he's still here, but the zoning code is not administered by planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| it's administered by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| The building plans review and inspection staff and their interpretation of what it's permitted in c6 has changed with closer review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=3996)|
| 1:06:45| of the c6 standards the c6 does allow parking so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| I think was worse reference employee parking could be permitted in the c6 section of this property the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4010)|
| 1:06:58| C6 was was placed along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| start planes pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Maintain some type of a control over the development of that area close to the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| the c6 does require plan review by the by the planning staff prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| issuance of permits and it was felt that that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| Designate zoning designation would allow some would allow review and would also maintain some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4037)|
| 1:07:26| Aesthetic control over the the development that occurred along the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| Okay, so the plan that's been submitted by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| proposed trucking company that's in our packets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| They would be able to do the parking in the c6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| I have not seen that plan and I would I caution you that a plan or a promise made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4062)|
| 1:07:50| As part of the zoning is worth the paper. It's written on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| Once property is zoned any use permitted in that zoning district can be made so we try not to review plans too closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| I can tell you that that based on interpretation from the plans review and inspection staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| Employee parking could occur in the c6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| section for a trucking terminal as I mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| Brock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Mr. Brock said no trucking no parking of trucks or no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| Activity directly related to the trucking terminal could it could be placed on that that c6 portion only the employee parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4104)|
| 1:08:34| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| believe from reviewing the packet and watching the NPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| That the historic discussion when this property was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| From an entirety of c6 to an end to I three which I think is a little unusual to have I three with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| Residential next to it was an intent of creating a buffer to the area surrounding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| So I I'm just don't understand the necessity of removing that buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| From the area surrounding that as well. Yeah. Thank you councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| Yeah, that's that's pretty much my line of questioning as well. So I don't really know why I mean, maybe mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| Brock you can explain why you want all of it zoned I three and not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| Since your employee parking is allowed and in that front area. How many employees you expect to have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4159)|
| 1:09:29| We don't know what the buyer has planned as far as the number of employees we you know, I've heard numbers around 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4169)|
| 1:09:37| But what they have told us is that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| expect to use that area for employee parking, but can't envision the need to park trucks there and so that's why the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4181)|
| 1:09:49| request to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Have it rezone is being made. So there's no landscaping requirements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| Gerald run under I three no none at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| He's not the c6 does have that plan review and does have some landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| Only requirement and landscaping requirements that come to play under the i3 or those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Embedded in the parking ordinance which provides minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| And some interior landscaping on a parking area the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| That were to accommodate 150 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| so for them to be to have back to your point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| no matter what we say here tonight, it doesn't bond a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| Landscaping plan but to bond a landscaping plan to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| Under an i3. What would he have to do? There would have to be a condition place and I look to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4237)|
| 1:10:45| Your astute attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| For help here to make sure I'm not speaking out of not out of turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| But there would have to be a condition describing in some level of specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| The landscape buffer that would be required and that condition would have to be placed on any zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| Approval for the i3 zoning in order to make it mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| There's there's still the issue of whether conditional zoning is something that's authorized in the state of Tennessee or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| We have never gotten that case that we keep hoping to get that tells us whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| Conditions attached to a particular zoning classification can in fact be enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| That's been going on for over 20 years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| We've been waiting on a case to say whether you can attach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| Specific conditions to zoning beyond what that zoning classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| That would be further restrictive of that particular zoning classification and that would be enforced by the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| I know that you all have attached those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| Conditions on a number of occasions in the hope that that would be the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| But I cannot provide legal assurance to you that that would be the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| So is there any other zoning that he can have a truck terminal on other than i3 that would allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| landscape restrictions and buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| Under the proposed zoning code there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| Under none under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| That would allow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Trucking terminal is proposed and require landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| Yeah, but it would under this futuristic recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| Seems seems to me your all's options are to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| Put it up for vote or try to go back and come to a landscaping plan that everybody can agree to and somehow you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| Could attach it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| Right, mr. Brock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| Yeah, we're not asking for anything more than what as you've mentioned is done many times before I'm sure you are buyers not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4374)|
| 1:13:04| Buy this property with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| Landscaping restriction on it with the intent that they're going to violate it on the assumption that maybe it's not enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| We would have to provide that assurance and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| That is something that can also be, you know handled through the permitting process that that landscaping would have to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| I think it's already so it's really already granted under c6 and I can't I can't support them. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| Can't support the rezoning on it, you know without that in place without some mechanism to protect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| So that's my opinion and it's not so much like for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| It's not so much the landscaping component to that is the prohibition against parking trucks, right? So again, you know, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| We would be okay with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Correct me if I'm wrong, but we'd be okay with the c6 designation if we could have removed this prohibition against parking trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| Thank you protective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| The investment we have in condominiums and houses across the street and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| Just I just can't get I just can't get there on it. So so much. I'd like to you guys can't thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| Councilwoman Ryder, I think I can't support this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4444)|

| 1:22:30| Thank you, Mark Walker. I am chief financial officer of KUB. I live 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4950)|
| 1:22:38| Each year KUB does make in lieu of tax payments for its electric and gas systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| To those taxing jurisdictions in which our systems are located including the city of Knoxville Knox County and several other jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| mostly outlying counties in which our electric system is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| Located that is required under the city charter and also through state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| The amounts that are calculated are in your resolution this evening are calculated and based on a formula set forth in state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4979)|
| 1:23:07| They do represent the maximum amounts that can be paid under law as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| So I believe in total for the city share that was around twelve point three million dollars for the electric and gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| Payments Knox County about ten point four million. All the other taxing jurisdictions combined was around nine hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=4998)|
| 1:23:27| The questions I have about this is that on my KUB bill there's a taxes category where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| Where did those taxes go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| That is actually a sales tax that is has nothing to do with what was before us this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| that is a sales tax that we are required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| Get is in accordance with state law and we pass that straight through to the state government's Tennessee Department of Revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| We don't keep any of that. That's just a flow-through. Now KUB is a nonprofit. That is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| So I was just surprised to see a sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| It is within state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| there are certain utility services in which we are required to recover a tax from our customers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| Then we have to pass that straight through to the State Department of Revenue. It's nothing we keep that is in compliance with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5050)|

| 1:37:32| With the research which has been presented to you all this evening. My questions to the members of this council are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| There's truly no one on these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| Have they truly been abandoned and who was responsible for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| I asked the council that if these locations are truly abandoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| isn't that eminent domain and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| When something is eminent domain does not the city seize that property and take control of the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=5875)|

| 1:40:08| Interestingly, I initially came upon these cemeteries on April 15th by chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6008)|
| 1:40:14| When I was in Lonsdale and got lost while cutting across the ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6014)|

| 1:40:35| Anger and intense sadness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6035)|

| 1:41:43| Told me when he was a teen in the late 50s that the upkeep of these cemeteries then was a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| So we know for at least 60 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| These historic cemeteries have been severely neglected my recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| Conversation yesterday with Knox Heritage's Holly Cook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| Noted that these cemeteries have been abandoned for years and have no owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| she also noted that all efforts to maintain these cemeteries have been cyclic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| Irregular at best and cleanups have been done by jail prisoners Boy Scouts and concerned groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6133)|

| 1:42:50| Cleanup committees and concerned groups are not the way to revitalize these cemeteries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6170)|
| 1:42:57| It's just a patch-up job all prior efforts to maintain this property have treated the symptoms and not the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6177)|
| 1:43:06| Without a regular owner for these cemeteries the problem doesn't go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| It's a problem. That's very embarrassing and we believe reflects poorly on the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| Since these cemeteries are located in the city limits. I see the city as being responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| Mayor Ruggiero and councilmembers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| This is a public health and safety issue for the neighborhood and those trying to visit graves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| It appears that this would be a liability issue for the city if the problem is known and nothing is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| The lack of regular maintenance of this property could also suggest to people that the city doesn't value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6220)|

| 1:44:02| Closing it's my guess that many of the City Council members here have not ever visited these cemeteries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| So between now and the next City Council meeting I challenge all of you to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| I also challenge our viewers on television to visit these cemeteries and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190423?start=6254)|
