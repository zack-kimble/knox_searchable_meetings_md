| 0:02:34| Thank you. We have eight members present, so we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and the minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| 10A, we had a request to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Is that for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| 10A is one of the appeals, so we have a motion and a second to postpone that two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Any opposed? That is postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Under consent items, we have 11H, which is a certificate of compliance, and 12Q is a 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| Move for approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and those items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| For the mayor's report, well finally we made it to election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| I know you're going to be sad to not see all those commercials on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| The polls are open tonight until 8 o'clock, so that's just a little under two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| If you haven't voted, we encourage people to get out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| As you know, we'll be selecting our next U.S. Senator, our U.S. House of Representatives member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| and our governor and state lawmakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| There are no city offices on this ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| CAT provided free rides to the polls today, or still are, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| and we wanted to make sure that voting was as easy as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| and eliminate barriers like transportation to casting a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| In fact, there was fare-free service on all CAT buses today for wherever you were traveling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| and we will also provide fare-free service for the 2019 city elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| I want to thank KUB crews, our first responders, and our city crews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| and public service and engineering departments for their speed and skill in dealing with last night's storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| It takes a lot of teamwork to get the power restored, the roads cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| and for our first responders to be able to get out to all the calls that they received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| So thank you to the police and fire as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Our public service crews scrambled early and chainsawed down trees before most of us got up to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=295)|
| 0:05:04| They coordinated with KUB to clear the roads of trees and debris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| so KUB could get utilities back up after the heavy winds wreaked such havoc last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| Thanks to urban forester Casey Krause, who mobilized the city chainsaw teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| and directed crews to where they were most needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| Altogether, public service committed 25 workers to clearing roads and removing the downed trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| and another 18 workers cleaned up the debris that was pushed to the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| They responded to more than 65 downed tree calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| That's more than 300 staff hours of hard physical labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Engineering sign crews were out at 4.30 a.m., and they closed 12 roads due to the trees being down or the power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| They assisted with our traffic control crews to get traffic signals back in working order as KUB restored order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=349)|
| 0:05:57| There may be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| How many do we still have out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Last thing I heard, there were still 10 that did not have power restored to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Okay, so we're ready once KUB is able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| KUB had a huge job today, so we appreciate their crews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| But once they get power to those lights, then we'll have them back on, or those traffic signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| So thanks to the crews of public service and engineering and their directors, Chad Weth and Jim Hagerman, for a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| It's a testament to both of these departments, their persistence and their dedication, that they were able to do as much as they did today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| So I want to take a minute to talk about professional baseball in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| Many people have asked us to bring the Smokies back home to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| And I imagine many of you, like my children and I, we enjoyed going to the Smokies games when they were back at the Bill Myers Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| And I moved here in 1980, and at the time it was the Knoxville Blue Jays, the KJs, I think until about 1993 or so when they were back to the Smokies again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=414)|
| 0:07:04| And so we all enjoyed going there, and it was just a great thing to have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| And we have had them just a short drive away in Sevier County since the 2000 season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| But despite that, we would love to have them closer. We'd love to have them back to their roots here in the heart of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| People all over the country have seen what a great resource baseball can be for a downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| I've gone to numerous cities and seen this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| It's accessible to local families and visitors alike, provides a stimulus for jobs, builds community, and just adds to our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| And Knoxville would be no exception. I think baseball would be a great addition back to our core downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| So back in August, I announced my intent to begin discussions with the Knoxville Smokies to explore the possibility of moving the team back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| And deputies to the mayor, Bill Lyons and David Brace, are leading those conversations now with the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| We don't have anything to report yet, but we will keep you posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| So moving on to Knoxville's 93rd annual Veterans Day Parade will be held in downtown on Friday, November 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=486)|
| 0:08:16| That's this Friday beginning at 1045 a.m. to honor the service of U.S. military veterans, and in particular, those who served in Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=496)|
| 0:08:25| This year's grand marshal is U.S. Air Force Captain Bill Robinson, the longest held enlisted prisoner of war in American history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=505)|
| 0:08:34| He served some of those years with the late Senator John McCain being imprisoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| We thank the American Legion for organizing the parade, which will be broadcast live on WATE Channel 6, WBIR Channel 10, and streamed on WBIR.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=520)|
| 0:08:52| WIVK FM radio personality Gunner will serve as the event's emcee. He's there every year and does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=532)|
| 0:09:01| Approximately 1,900 participants and eight marching bands will line up on Howard Baker Jr. Avenue in front of the Civic Auditorium with a step-off time at 1045 a.m. on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=541)|
| 0:09:14| So be in place by 1045. The parade will roll up Church Avenue and turn right onto Gay Street, continuing through to the 100 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=554)|
| 0:09:24| Of course, everyone is invited and encouraged to come downtown and honor our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| So finally, there are some folks we want to recognize who are here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| The Cumberland Avenue Corridor Project, y'all remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| And the Old City Streetscapes Project along Jackson Avenue were selected as statewide winners at the Engineering Excellence Awards and 50th Anniversary Gala of the American Council of Engineering Companies in Nashville on Friday, October 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=579)|
| 0:10:00| So the Cumberland Avenue Project and our consulting team from Vaughn & Melton Consulting Engineers, Inc. received the Grand Award for Special Projects, Large Jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=600)|
| 0:10:11| The Old City Streetscapes Project and CDM Smith received the Grand Award for Surveying and Mapping Technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=611)|
| 0:10:21| These complicated projects required expertise and teamwork involving multiple city departments, consultants, contractors, and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=621)|
| 0:10:30| The collaborations and especially the wonderful great end results are truly worth celebrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=630)|
| 0:10:38| So the project teams tonight who are here with us, first project teams from Vaughn & Melton and CDM Smith will present the awards to the city and say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=638)|
| 0:10:49| And then we'll snap a quick photo of each company's team and the city engineering and redevelopment staff members with whom they closely worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=649)|
| 0:10:58| I'm going to join them down there at the podium as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| So first let me introduce them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| First, Vaughn & Melton, we'll hear from David Harrell, Regional Vice President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| From Becky Rehorn, who was the Chief Marketing Officer and did all the communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| It was just fabulous for that whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| And Ryan Henley, the Project Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| And after they finish, then CDM Smith's team will explain the cutting edge technology they used in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| So we have Bob Bowers, who is the Business Development Manager, and Cassie Holmes, Project Manager, who will be here to do a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| So as I'm heading on down there, Vaughn & Melton, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=693)|
| 0:11:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| I'm David Harrell, Regional Vice President for Vaughn & Melton, 1909 Ayler Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| You know, it's not often that one gets the opportunity to participate in a project of this magnitude that has the kind of impact that it's had and it's continuing to have on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=710)|
| 0:12:00| As engineers, we are all about protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| And this project has certainly done that and has accomplished it by drastically reducing accidents between vehicles as well as bicyclists and pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=725)|

| 0:13:09| The Cumberland Avenue Corridor project stood out to me for several reasons, the foremost being the improvement in safety inherent in the design solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| Engineering excellence was demonstrated by not just what's above the street, but what's below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| The project served as a catalyst to private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| The client expressed the project met their needs and expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| And finally, this project stood out amongst tough competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| There were many other projects demonstrating excellence, with the Cumberland Avenue Corridor judged to be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| It's truly been an honor being a part of this team and this team effort in making this project one to be celebrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| We are pleased to present this award to the City, recognizing this accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=829)|

| 0:14:36| Good evening. Bob Bowers with C.D.M. Smith, 1100 Merion Street here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| Let me first echo David's comments about our working relationship with the City of Knoxville staff and redevelopment and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| It was truly a great experience on this project and many others through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| As was said, the project involved the section, improvement of the section of Jackson Avenue east of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| It had one particular element that was a bit unusual in that several of the historic structures lining the street had basements that extended under the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=905)|
| 0:15:18| and out toward the curb line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| In order to properly design the sidewalk and to recover the basement areas without damaging them and obviously preserving them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=920)|
| 0:15:30| it was necessary to know where they were in relation to the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| So we used some rather new and innovative technology to scan, develop a point cloud scan of the basement areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=934)|
| 0:15:45| and the above ground areas and then merge those two together into a full 3D file of the composite area of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=945)|
| 0:15:56| With that, we were able to provide Cassie and her design staff with the information they needed to design the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| It was that element of the project that we submitted for the award and I'm fortunate to be selected as the grand prize winner in that category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=964)|
| 0:16:16| which relates to surveying and mapping technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=980)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=993)|
| 0:17:03| Once again, that's really a great recognition for our consultants and for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1023)|
| 0:17:13| Those are really great projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| We appreciate everybody who was involved in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So Council, that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Are there any Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1041)|

| 0:18:09| I just wanted to wish everyone a happy Diwali.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Today is Diwali, which is the biggest Hindu festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| It's a festival of lights, and so I know my family in India is having a blast right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| There's a celebration tomorrow night at the Hindu Community Center right off of Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Happy Diwali.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Okay, any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| Okay, so we'll move on to appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| 10D is a resolution approving an appeal of Paul Williams of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| to deny a request for an increase in height from 45 feet to 81 feet 3 inches for a new hotel to be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| at 9101 Executive Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Paul Williams, applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Mr. Williams, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| That's you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I'm Paul Williams, 1726 Lamar Alexander Parkway in Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Okay, so let me just say this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| This is an administrative hearing, so normally we would have up to three speakers for up to five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| and then if there are any respondents, which nobody signed up opposing this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1159)|
| 0:19:27| but we do have for counsel's pleasure Peter Ahrens is here to answer any questions of the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1167)|
| 0:19:35| in their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| But so what we'll do is give each of you, we'll give you, pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| How about one for five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| One for five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| That's even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| So we'll have one person, we'll have up to five minutes, and you see the timer up above my head there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| If you would just keep an eye on that, then I won't have to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| But go right ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Okay, I'll introduce Mr. Gary Bess, the project architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| So I'm the one for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| I'm Gary Bess, Best Associates Architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Ten years ago, we were asked to design a hotel at the corner of Executive Park Drive and Park Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| It's a one-acre site, which is tough for a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| We do a lot of hotels, and if I get something less than an acre and a half, it's tough, and this is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| You can look at the package that we put before you, and you can see the first 11 by 17 shows the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| If you'll notice that, there's not a whole lot of places on that site to put a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| So in the first challenge, we began to investigate with the city, meeting with staff members and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| okay, how are we going to put something on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| We've got a sewer line that runs through the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| We've got stormwater that runs through the middle of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| In meeting with staff, we quickly addressed that in the C3 zone, we can only have a 45-foot height limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| Realizing that this site has 12-foot fall from Executive Park Drive to Village Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| So I've got a basement, whether I want it or not, kind of deal with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| So I'm going to start with this site a floor below Executive Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| So staff said, take it to BZA, let's talk about a variance on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| So we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| And in 2009, May of 2009, which is the first sheet that you have in your package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| we were granted a variance for the height on this particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| Due to the fact that was 2009, if you remember, that was the crash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| this hotel came back with a parking garage below it and it just wasn't feasible at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| So we kind of shelved the project until a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| Our client comes back to us and says, okay, economy's better, we're ready to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| So we start the design again, different franchise of hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| This time, the original hotel was five stories with a parking garage below it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| This time we said, all right, let's do four stories, parking garage below it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| So we've reduced the height from our original request by a full story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| We've also taken from the original design was a pitched roof and this is now a flat roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| In this design, we've then submitted and been going through the billing department to get approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| We're down to the last item, and the last item is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| staff says they no longer will recognize the variance that was granted to us in 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| and that we would have to go before Board of Zoning Appeals again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| We then go before Board of Zoning Appeals and they deny us the request to have the height variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| There are many hotels in this area, and if you'll look through that package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| there's two sets of things in the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| The first one is the Fairfield Inn that we designed ten years ago, and you can see the height on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| We got a variance to 72 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| The building had a peak of 76, and the discussion of what is building height on a sloped roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| it's the average of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| On a flat roof, it's the top of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Our new design is to the top of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| It's to a flat roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| The board felt like we got a vote of four to three and said that they weren't going to allow anything over 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| All we're asking for tonight is the same consideration that we had nine years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| that the Board of Zoning Appeals approved us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Understanding this C3 zone, the oddity of it is it says 45 feet is the height for everything except an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1413)|
| 0:23:44| If I build an office building in C3, guess how tall I can build it? 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| The consideration that we had for the Board of Zoning Appeals previously was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| why are we allowing, you being me, a 90-foot office building and we can't allow a 90-foot hotel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| The Board of Zoning Appeals at that point felt the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Tonight, we request that you reverse the order of the Board of Zoning Appeals to allow us to build this hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| There's nobody to respond, so we'll just go to Council's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Let me start by asking Director Green a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| What's being asked of us today, you know, we're being asked about a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| but is there a possibility that what they're requesting could actually be accomplished through a rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1477)|
| 0:24:47| Is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| I have not researched that, but a rezoning may be a better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| I think the Council may not be aware, but there are conditions or standards that must be met for a variance to be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| Those are hardships not imposed by the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| And not knowing a lot of the background of this request, finding a hardship just immediately to increase the height seems challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1507)|
| 0:25:17| And, again, I have not researched this, but a rezoning may be a better approach than a variance request on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1517)|
| 0:25:26| That's something that could be considered, but I don't know that it would take conversation with the applicant, with Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| and with my staff in a review of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| There are a number of different zoning designations in the area of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| so there's no consistent zoning in that area, which would make it more feasible for a rezoning of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| but we'd have to look at all the variables involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| So I think the issue here is that to accomplish what you're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| the standard of review for Council is going to make it, I think, very difficult for us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| So what I was going to suggest, if you're amenable to it, would be to have a two-week delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| and have you meet with MPC and see if there's a rezoning that we could work up that would allow this to occur at the height you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1571)|
| 0:26:20| Is that something you'd be agreeable to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Possible, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| So I guess a question back was, we got a rezone nine years ago, or a variance for height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1585)|
| 0:26:37| Nothing's changed in nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| The project is now shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| It's a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| The two site plans that I've given you show that the building is in the same place as it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1602)|
| 0:26:53| And I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| I think that if we proceed, then I'm going to ask what the standard of review is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| and I think it's going to make it difficult to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| So I might recommend we go forward with the two-week and have a discussion with MPC about the potential for a rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| and then we can hear it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| If that doesn't work out, you're welcome to come back, and obviously we'll hear about it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| But given the quasi-judicial review that we have here, we're barred from having conversations prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| so you're watching the sausage being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| We've been here and done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| But if you're amenable to that, then I would suggest we postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| and let's see where we can get with the potential for a rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| So I'll make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| We have a motion and a second to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| The ayes have it, and it is postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| 11A is a resolution expressing its condolences to the members of the Tree of Life Synagogue and the City of Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| Mayor, there was just a beautiful vigil last week attended by members of all faiths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1695)|
| 0:28:23| and with this resolution, council is really echoing your comments at that vigil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| about how hate and intolerance really have no place in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| Knoxville is a welcoming community to members of all faiths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| and I'd like to call on Chip Raymond to come up and address council following 11 seconds of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1718)|
| 0:29:03| Chip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Mayor, council, Councilman Roberto, Chief Thomas, I'm Chip Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| I'm president of the Knoxville Jewish Alliance Arnstein Jewish Community Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| and I thank you for your resolution supporting the Tree of Life Synagogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| and the resolution's expression that Knoxville is a welcoming and tolerant city, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| Listen to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Our vigil was a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| The Presbyterians provided parking at their church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| The Methodists drove the shuttle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| The Unitarians were on the speaker's platform along with the mayor and Marilyn Callett, our city poet laureate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1783)|
| 0:29:51| who presented a beautiful poem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| She happens to be a member of Temple Beth-El.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Yossine, a falafel house, was in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| And I know Catholics and Episcopalians were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| The Baptists had to be there because they're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| And the church community probably outnumbered our small Jewish community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| and that's okay because it was interfaith at its best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| Mayor and Chief Thomas, we're going to ask for a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| but we know it's a lot because of resources and manpower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| but we would like more of a police presence, and here's how we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| We're going to ask your officers to eat lunch on our campuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| and we have a chef, Kim Alt, who prepares for our preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| and she'll fix something really good, and I know you're not supposed to take free lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| We'll charge a dollar or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| But unless they want a meat and three and the meat is a pork chop, it ain't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| We'd like to ask them to drive by more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| We're on Kingston Pike, Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| You know where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| And ask them to take their breaks on our campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| And when we call, if you could please respond, it means that we have a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| The state of Tennessee Homeland Security contacted us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| and we'll try to use the highway patrol in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| So this was not my original idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| I'm copying the state of Tennessee Homeland Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| And Chief Thomas, your officer, Chris Hutton, has already reached out to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| about active shooter training on our campuses, and we want that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| and we understand you work jointly with the FBI on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| How about a campaign against hate, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| Let's get our outstanding public relations firms, our radios, our TVs, our billboard owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1913)|
| 0:32:02| to provide pro bono some messages about love, about getting along, about tolerance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| and plaster and broadcast them all over our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| We've had five incidents this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| A swastika was etched into our glass front at the Arnstein Jewish Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| At Temple Beth-El, a Hitler flyer with swastikas was placed on the rabbi's vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| and on our front doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| During Nashville, which is our smaller version of Greek Fest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| a kosher tax, whatever that is, flyer was placed on 26 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| And that's why we were all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| We had police presence, but nobody saw them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| A scathing anti-Israel program occurred a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| and you can't separate being Jewish from Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| At The Rock at UT, the Pittsburgh Steelers symbol, stronger than hate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| was just a few days ago replaced by stronger through hate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| and a swastika was painted over the Star of David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| And it's not just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| It's the black churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| It's the mosque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| It's our own Unitarian Church that was attacked 2008, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| We're all at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| And though I feel like the Jewish community in particular is being watched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| they seem to know where we are and when we're going to have events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| And, of course, we advertise them to our Jewish community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| So we appreciate all you do for us and all you will continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| And I'll just end it with hate against one of us is hate against all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| Chip, thank you for that, and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| And, by the way, I know there were some other members of the Muslim community there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| in addition to Yassin and a member from the Hindu Community Center I saw there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| So we were well represented that night by many faiths, many different denominations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| Did you get my email today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Actually, Chief Thomas and I are meeting with the three rabbis and anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| and you, if you can, tomorrow, just to follow up on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| If you're not able to make it, then we can follow up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| But we'll discuss some of this tomorrow at our meeting at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| I did get the email, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2076)|

| 0:34:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| Any other discussion for this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract number C-18-0261| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| with ServiceOne Incorporated to provide maintenance services for the city's streetlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| increasing the contract amount by $260,000 for a new contract total of $1,100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| and extending the term to January 13, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with Volkert Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| to provide owners representative services to manage the planning, design, bidding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| and construction of a new public safety complex in an amount not to exceed $1,441,960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| I would like to ask David Brace if he would explain the process we went through to choose this firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| and then make a comment about the fees, the fee for paying the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| And Boyce Evans is here as well, the Deputy Finance Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| and Penny Owens actually facilitated the RFQ group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| But this was an RFQ and there were 10 proposals that were submitted to the city into purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2179)|
| 0:36:27| that were reviewed by a group of city employees that included police, fire, city court, engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| and then obviously purchasing was there as well to facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Those proposals were evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| They were ranked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| And Volkert Engineering, and we actually have Volkert representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| if you will raise your hand in the back, Mr. Grammer and Mr. Barkner here from Volkert, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| they were the top-ranked firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| So this was an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| This was about experience and qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| At that point, the city and purchasing sit down and begin negotiating a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| because, again, this is about experience and professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| They've negotiated that fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| We believe the fee is competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| The average owner's rep fee is around 5, 5.5 percent in the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| and those range from 2.8 all the way up to 5.7, 5.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| So we believe 3.5 is a fair fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| and we believe that Volkert is the most qualified organization to lead this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| And, again, this is soup to nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| This is beginning with design, site evaluation, preliminary design, reviewing the programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| which, again, Benefield-Richter's done quite a bit of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| so some of that will be a handoff from Benefield-Richter's design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| And then one of the things that we had requested from Volkert, and they asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| do you want, during construction, do you want a full-time on-site person here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| And we said, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| And if you'll notice in their proposal, their fee structure, that was $1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| because that could be anywhere from two to three years depending on the warranty phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| if we choose to do the warranty phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| So multi-year project, very experienced firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| They do have a local office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Their corporate office is in Franklin and Mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| So we believe this is a very qualified group to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Did you turn your light off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| So you clarified that a lot of the cost of this, did you say a million dollars of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| is for the supervision on-site during the project, the length of it, multi-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| So this is a complicated project, and so we're asking this contractor, Volkert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| that does work all over the country, large projects, to be our fiduciary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| our owner's representative, to wake up every day thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| Right now there's a team of people who wake up every day thinking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| but it's not our sole job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| So Volkert will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Their sole job will be this project, bringing it in under budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| working through the complicated process of bringing multiple departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| and organizations together and designing a building within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| So one of their first tasks will be to work with purchasing to help hire the design team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| the design professionals that will lead the design part of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| But Volkert will be the owner's rep and, again, our employee, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| our contractor that wakes up with our interest every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| So where are we in the process with Tenova?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| The last thing council approved was looking at and assessing that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| and I don't think we've had any follow-up since that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| Where is that in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Yeah, so we've been working with Mr. Richter's, Glenn Richter's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| and his partner over at Benefield Richter's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| They've done some preliminary work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| They actually sat down and showed us some preliminary numbers, some ideas for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| I actually had lunch with Glenn yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| He is buttoning that up, hopes to have it done this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| and he'll have several options for us and numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| And he's essentially wrapped his work up, really, until Volkert gets on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| There's not too much more that Mr. Richter's can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| I believe he's up to about 25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Again, we had done a not to exceed, I believe, for 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| and I think at this point his work is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| and we are still discussing the Tenova option with the Tenova folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| and we hope to get back to council and the public very soon about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| One thing is this Volkert contract is not specific to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| It's specific to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| They are aware of the site, but they're going to be with us regardless of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| We will still at some point have information brought to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| where we assess whether that's the right site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| I mean, I think we would anticipate some preliminary dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| and probably a workshop in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2465)|

| 0:43:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| I would like to ask Peter Ahrens to come and just kind of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| the whole thing to make sure that we are not reducing transparency at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| The current regulations require city processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| If an applicant is denied a building permit for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| they can go to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| which is a city board, and we facilitate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| The way the code is written today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| if they want to appeal the BZA decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| they have to go down to the Metropolitan Planning Commission to get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| So the intention behind this ordinance change is to keep that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| that administrative process, within the city functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| We're working with the applicants from the time they make application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| for a building permit all the way to the completion of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| So really it's just a housekeeping item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| This is kind of in line with some of the things we're doing physically up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| on the fourth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Our goal is to try and facilitate our customers in getting their projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| up and running and to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| So the way it's currently set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| to send them to a separate department that's outside the city really adds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| a level of confusion and slows it down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| I guess it's an opportunity for Gerald to say how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| First of all, I'd like to point out that MPC is a city agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| We work for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| We are roofed under this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| We are part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| I'll just say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| I do think that all functions, when assigned to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| when one part is assigned to one department and another part to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| department causes inefficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| I would say that this increases efficiency and customer service for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| who are going through the variance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| So, Director Aarons, this is really about streamlining the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| And Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| you don't have an issue with what we're seeing in front of us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| I think it does streamline and makes it easier for the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| And I'm sure they left the appellants who were here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| They're going to plans review to make the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| and then coming to MPC to appeal is confusing for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| and this will make it less confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| So both city staff are in accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| We're like brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| The recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| We're becoming almost Siamese twins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2762)|

| 0:47:09| little bit about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2829)|

| 0:48:20| high demand in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| so it's something that we've really prioritized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| and this is the first step of many in terms of serving that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| So the alley closures are just going to make it where we have slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| larger lots within the existing street grid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| so we're using the existing zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| the density that's already allowed through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| and this will just make the project a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=2922)|

| 0:52:27| So please state your name and address for the record and watch the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Yeah, my name is Dean Preston Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| I live at 7011 Lawford Road, and this property is 9608 Westland in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| I'm the owner of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I've owned it for 16 years, paid taxes for the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| I've laid low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| There's been a lot of issues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Actually, for several years my property was kind of unzonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| It was locked in a lawsuit that I had nothing to do with by the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| homeowners in the area that are all in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| And so eventually that lawsuit, I guess, went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| And so I have just been sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| and I noticed that I wanted to eventually develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| And so the property adjacent to me is all in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| and it has gone for commercial zoning with no opposition from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| neighborhood and for some kind of self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| And so I thought I would do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| My property is kind of locked right there at the intersection of Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| It's right at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| And there's a lot of commercial development all around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| Oliver Smith just has a restaurant proposal right across the Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| And so I proposed that my property be zoned just like the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3234)|
| 0:54:02| property with the equivalent commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| In the county I think it was like a general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Pardon me, I'm not a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| And so I went for C4, and it passed through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| And the opposers are all within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| They're not taxpayers in the city like I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| And I think this will increase the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| and it will be congruent with all the other use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| immediately adjacent to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| And so I feel like it would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| an unfair restriction of my taxpayer rights to not have the exact same use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| my property as the adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| So here to speak against it, we have Wayne Kline, Jack Whittle, and Winn Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3291)|
| 0:54:59| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Please keep an eye on the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| I'm Jack Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| I live at 9520 Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| and I have brought a letter with me from a resident of Traymore that lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3309)|
| 0:55:16| adjacent in this area, and that is part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| She is opposed to this rezoning to a C4 in general commercial land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| and we are opposed to a rezoning of this to C4 in general commercial land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| We do support an office land use and an office zoning for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| and that's what we have proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| The statement here that he was seeking the same use at MPC is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3348)|
| 0:55:58| At MPC, his attorney did drop the idea that he would want to use this for some kind of self-service storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3358)|
| 0:56:07| and said that he was seeking to use it for any C4 zone use that could be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3367)|
| 0:56:16| The area around Westland Drive is pretty residential, and it has going out from it basically office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3376)|
| 0:56:25| There is a shoreline church and morning point assisted living both in the city that are across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| and they are low impact uses and generate minimal traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| On the southwest side and the opposite of the Pellissippi Parkway is an office complex and a Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| There is no great large commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| The Weigels has ended up being there because it was put there as part of a PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3408)|
| 0:56:57| that extended over about 100 acres in that area, and there's apartments and an office next to it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3417)|
| 0:57:06| On the immediately east of this property that is zoning is South County Commission zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| The frontage along Westland Drive, back 230 feet to office, and behind the 230 feet of frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3433)|
| 0:57:23| the community agreed that it was proper to put a self-service storage facility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3443)|
| 0:57:32| It's a single story with a basement, and it has a low traffic impact and a low effect on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3452)|
| 0:57:41| The developer of that property entered deed restrictions describing its look and use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| and a use on review has been filed with MPC that shows that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| It has limited height. There's a lack of noise. It has restricted lighting and signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| This property does not meet requirements for a general commercial zone in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| or commercial land use designation in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| It's neither regular in shape nor sufficient size to cover these kinds of matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| and the C-4 zone has many uses that basically involve heavy traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3490)|
| 0:58:18| and those uses should not be next to the ramp that is at Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| And C-4 is finally not compatible with the land use that's around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| because there is simply no C-4 sort of land use in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3509)|
| 0:58:38| The larger commercial zoning was basically intended for North Shore Drive and for Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3518)|
| 0:58:49| and that's what's happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| MPC's basis for recommending this was simply that there was a policy change which justified a C-4 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3533)|
| 0:59:03| but that's simply we disagree that that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| There's office zoning along the frontage of this property, and the road was for an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| and the back is a proper use for the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| C-4 zones include things like gas stations, hotels, motels, animal hospitals, drive-in commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| new and used car and truck sales, truck and trailer rental, and all kinds of open storage uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| and none of that is appropriate for this ramp along Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| We say that this C-4 zone is not appropriate for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| and the general commercial category designation is also not proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| We do think that an office zone is proper here, and we think that's what should be sought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| and we are willing to agree to some kind of office zone in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| Winn Bryant, is that who you want to speak next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Mr. Bryant, please state your name and address for the record, and if you'd watch the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| Your Honor, I'm Winn Bryant, address 1103 Walden Branch Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| Currently I'm the pastor of the West Emory Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| It's located at the corner of Westland and Emory Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| I'm concerned that rezoning these properties will significantly increase the volume of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| in an area that's already becoming quite heavily burdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| Just two blocks north of the church on Emory Road, a huge apartment complex is being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| Once complete, the residence of that facility cannot help but dramatically increase volume on Emory Church as well as Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| If commercial C4 zone businesses are allowed to occupy the properties under consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| this would exacerbate the congestion even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| This increase in traffic is not simply a matter of inconvenience to motorists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| that use these roads to commute and to nearby neighborhood residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| My primary concern is that this poses additional threat to the safety of the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| that attend the preschool that meets at the church Monday through Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| as well as to their parents during drop-off and pick-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Motorists already zip through the church's parking lot to avoid the lines at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| and this will only make this dangerous situation worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| I would urge the council to not allow this to be rezoned C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Thank you, Pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| And now Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| And it's a pleasure to be before you, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| After all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Feeling really special tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Over all the bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| And I hope your health returns very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| I am Wayne Kline, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| Also 1226 Birch Cove Way is my residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| I live out in this neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| In 1987, we established the Westland West Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| We have been active for over 31 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| And I remember being in front of the mayor before she was the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| arguing for appropriate zoning at this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3736)|
| 1:02:26| We even fought the ramp going from Pellissippi down to Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| but we lost that after we won at the Supreme Court level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| We got to go back to county commission where, on a vote of 18 to 0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| the ramp got put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| And so the important point there was we need the ramp for emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| We don't need it for a commercial venture down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| And because Oliver Smith had so many acres that he wanted to develop into PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| and other office, he got three acres of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| And that's how the Weigels got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| But other than that, every bit of development has been in cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| with our homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| We represent everybody from Ebenezer Road to North Shore Drive on Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| And we have almost 100% membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| We're here tonight to ask this council not to open Pandora's box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| Although your applicant says he wants to have the same thing next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| what happened next door and why it became a commercial zone in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| was that the developer, Mr. Allen, worked with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| worked with the neighbors, and put restrictive covenants such that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| the only thing he can put there is self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| Now, you can't take into consideration restrictive covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| That's not part of what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| But you can consider what your applicant is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| And what he's asking for is a C4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| That's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| If he wanted to work with us and work on restrictive covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| that would restrict the area to self-storage, we'd be happy to work with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| In fact, self-storage is part of an office zone and can be considered there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| So what is really going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Your applicant already has a for-sale sign out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| so it looks like what he wants to do is increase his commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| change it to commercial, and then sell it for the highest dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| That's incompatible with what's been going on in our neighborhood for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| And we'd ask that this council please deny his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| Office zone is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| And I have a minute and 50 seconds I would like to reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Well, it doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| I can't work that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| It doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| It's been so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| In my court, it doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| It's been so long, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| Thank you very much for your service and thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| And council can now ask questions of either party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Okay, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| Do you need to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| Well, I was just going to say I do need to abstain due to a conflict of interest on this and M&M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Mr. Smith, the applicant, just had a couple thoughts for you if you want to approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3930)|
| 1:05:38| And I understand your point that, you know, commercial has been introduced into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| You know, there is office there, but predominantly the area is still residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| So I'm really uncomfortable with the C4 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| It does have a lot of uses that I think are not compatible with a primarily residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| That doesn't mean that, you know, you couldn't have an office space there or some lesser degree of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| So what I was wanting to ask you is if you were okay with a zoning that might be a less intense use than C4 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3970)|
| 1:06:20| Well, of course I would be open to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| I can tell you that if you look at this property, this property is really restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| I think they're kind of inflating the impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| This is a very unique property that only maybe a 4,000-square-foot building or some self-storage is amenable there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=3991)|
| 1:06:40| There's nothing that you can put on there commercially that's going to majorly impact any kind of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| Also, I think if you look around the intersection, it is more commercial than residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| It's not residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| I again would like to remind the city council these are all county people that are opposing me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| and I am a taxpayer in the city, and I am a person that wants to kind of increase revenue and potential use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4021)|
| 1:07:10| I do plan on doing self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| It's really kind of limiting because the person next to me would also be my competitor, and he doesn't want me to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| and he's reached out to me, and he actually is not planning on a single-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| He's planning on a multiple-story building, and he's going to have to have access for his commercial property off of Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4042)|
| 1:07:31| And so I feel like it's – I think it's just kind of a historical objection to kind of commercialism in their area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| and I understand that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| I'm very respectful for that, but I think that I've been landlocked for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| and I just need more opportunities, and I want more for my tax investment from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4066)|
| 1:07:54| And so back to your question, am I amenable to open other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4074)|
| 1:08:00| Yes, but I think that it's really unfortunate that they made these –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| the neighbors there, I think, have gained a parcel of property to their benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| and I think that they're kind of restricting my ability to do what I can with this city product property that was annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4092)|
| 1:08:20| this finger annexation along Pellissippi that was beyond my control, and I'm limited now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| And because the city did that, which is fine, but I'm hoping that the city will support me in being able to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| And my understanding is I can't do self-storage and office zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| and so it has to be commercial in order to be equivalent to the person right next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| And I am on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| I am at a major intersection, and it's a very active place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| and I think for the people in the region to have this view that they're a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| and all that is unfortunately not going to be the case because we've all been on Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| We know it's an interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| Well, I mean, I definitely want to see you be able to, you know, utilize the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| and I understand what you're talking about with the commercial use here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| It's just – I just can't, you know, support C-4 in this area just because there's too much residential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4152)|
| 1:09:23| I can definitely agree with office, and so I can think of a couple options we could look at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| One, if you're agreeable to office, then I think we can go ahead and move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| Otherwise, what I'd suggest is maybe making a recommendation to go back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| to consider the appropriateness of a less intense commercial use other than C-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| and see what we get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Yeah, I've done that, and for self-storage, that's the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| It's C-4 and C-6, and so I'm locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| And so all I can say is I need the city's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| You know, 16 years of paying taxes in the city out there and being surrounded by county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| I'm kind of an island, and I'm hoping that the city council will understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| that I deserve what my neighbors immediately adjacent to me have, and restrictive covenants or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| And I've reached out to the individuals behind me, and nobody's contacted me until these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| and so I guess that's all I can really say to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Director Green, what we're hearing about the use of this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| in order to use it for self-storage, is C-4 the only option here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| C-4 allows outdoor storage, and C-3 would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| Now, one key difference between the two, I think if we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| if your suggestion of remanding it to MPC to look at potential commercial zonings would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4260)|
| 1:11:09| so that we could discuss with Mr. Smith in greater detail his plans for development of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| find appropriate zoning, and we also have to think that it would be the December meeting of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4274)|
| 1:11:24| and then here in January, and we have to think about what zoning under the hope for a new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4284)|
| 1:11:33| would be appropriate for the development of the property as envisioned by Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| and that would not adversely impact the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| So what you're hearing, Mr. Smith, is that there may be a good reason to go back to MPC to look at some lesser uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4302)|
| 1:11:52| and that also gives you an opportunity, and I will facilitate, if I can, a discussion between the two parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| and I don't know, Mr. Frost, if I'm allowed to facilitate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| It looks like it's a yes, so I'd be happy to facilitate that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| so that maybe we can all come to an agreement and then we can reconvene and look at this at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4327)|
| 1:12:17| Well, I guess I respectfully still ask for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| I still contend that I'm a city taxpayer, live in the city, my property is in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| the opposition is from the county, and so if you want to facilitate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| I want open storage or I want a good use for my property that I've paid, you know, I've held for 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| and actually, as I remind everybody here, I was caught up in a lawsuit that I had nothing to do with for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| where it couldn't even be zoned, and I've sat back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| I've been a good guy, and now I want just what the neighbors next to me have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| so I would respectfully ask that the city council give me a vote, and if we then go accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4379)|
| 1:13:10| I'm going to make a motion to refer back to MPC to consider the appropriateness of a less intense commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| such as office, but something other than C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| Yeah, all three have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Okay, so I was just checking on the proper motion since this was the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| Could you include in your motion the other two, this is the sector plan, could you include the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| and the zoning issues with that same motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| Yes, so I think it should include items L, M, and N in that motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| We can do one vote on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Okay, so it's a motion to refer L, M, and N back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| For consideration of a less intense commercial use than C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| You got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Did you still want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| You had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Stephanie has her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Councilman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| That's okay, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| So this question is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| So did I understand you to say that if this does go back to MPC for that consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| it potentially could be resolved through the recode map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| We'd have to look at not only at the current zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| but also the proposed zoning ordinance to see what zones would work under both provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Because I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| Mr. Smith may get his zoning approval in January, February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| I often misplace idealism that I still have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| thinking that maybe the new zoning ordinance may be adopted in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| So we'd have to think about both the new and the old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| I'm more idealistic than that, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| So we'd have to think about both this ordinance and the new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| and make sure the zoning that we apply proposed under the current ordinance would work for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| but also the zoning under the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| We'd be looking through two lenses, basically, at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| Great. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| So I've heard a couple of statements about this property has been unzonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| So could somebody explain to me what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| It looks like it's currently zoned low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| So has it not been zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| I don't know the history of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| I know Mr. Smith referred to a lawsuit, and that was before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| So it currently has a zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| I guess that's what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| It's agricultural, but for about three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| the Neighborhood Association had a lawsuit that tied it up in the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| and so I met with the city, and they literally said it's kind of non-zonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| It's frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| And I had nothing to do with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| I think you can do one anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| I just want to clarify with Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| So do you already ‑‑ is it the property for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| and you're out marketing it as a use for self-storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| or do you have someone lined up to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| So, actually, we are totally in line for self-storage development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| but, quite honestly, the person that they've made an arrangement with next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| that got the general commercial for self-storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| he has approached me and asked me not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| And I said, well, you know, I wish there was a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| You would see how unique this ‑‑ it is a C‑shaped property with setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Yeah, there's very little buildable space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| And so I told him that I would see what the market would present itself as an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| because he obviously doesn't want self-storage next to his self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| So, yes, I think is it for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Would I be entertaining other uses for limited commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| because it's of its footprint capability, but the plan is for self-storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| because I get to piggyback off of his expertise and his ability to do self-storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4648)|
| 1:17:35| and I have very limited use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| The guy who's already doing the self-storage on the other part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| Next door in the county that's general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| So that's who you've been in conversations with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| So this is kind of in respect of him, but also me just making sure that my options are open as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| So I think I'm in favor of pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| I know that you're not in favor of that, but pushing the pause button like Councilman Roberto has suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| and having a mediated conversation and talking to MPC to see if something different with an ozone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| C4 is problematic for various reasons, outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| It's not very desirable in residential areas, and there's historically been a lot of pushback to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| If we vote tonight and we turn you down, I'm just saying if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| if that were to happen versus having a conversation first, then you can't come back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| And so rather than – see what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| You'd have to change something about your application and come back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| So I would rather say if we can go with that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| then let's have a discussion before we jump into eliminating what your plans are for a full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| That's the way the rules work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| You can come back office for a year, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| You could not come back for C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| You probably could come back for office or some other different use, but the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| if you were denied C4, sir, you couldn't apply for C4 again for another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| So I think what we're saying is the idea of having a conversation first before we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| or deny you for a C4 and nail that down for if it were denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| you couldn't apply again for a whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Yeah, yeah, that sounds reasonable as long as I'm not closing that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| I just want what my immediate neighbor has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| I mean, that's exactly what he has in the county, and this is the equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| I've already spent a lot of time with MPC talking about what is the best equivalent zoning exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| for what they have and for cell storage, and C4 was recommended, and that's what they supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| and that's what passed in a vote of 12-2 by MPC, and I just felt like it was all logical and reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| So as long as it doesn't close those options, then I appreciate your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| Okay, so, counsel, we have a motion and a second to refer 12L, M, and N back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4792)|
| 1:20:00| for consideration of a lesser commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| We have one abstention, so seven ayes and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| So that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| Okay, so now we move on to O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| 12O is an ordinance to resume property located on the east side of North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| south of Central Street from C3 district to C2 district, subject to one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| a Michelle Mockery applicant, 6th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Did you hear her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Was that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Oh, you're pushing your button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| All right, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| 12P is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| southwest of Hanes-Turkey Road from O1 district with conditions to O1 district without conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| for the northeast portion of the property, Benchmarks Associates Applicants, 5th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| I'll motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| I just wanted some discussion on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| All right, so we have the motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| As you all may recall, this was rezoned years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| and what we're doing tonight is removing the conditions we placed on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| whether that's allowable by law or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| We're just reverting this back to O1 with no conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| so the applicant can build a single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| But as far as I'm concerned, and Gerald can correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| at some point the property may be able to be surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| and anything under the O1 uses can be built on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| And I would clarify that no conditions in your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| that there are no conditions on the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Yeah, that's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| and I'm also assuming that under state law we can't condition rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| There's a long memo that the former—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| No, former—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Krista Kukuro wrote about conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| especially conditions on uses, which are very problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| and should not be placed on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| Conditions on uses should not be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| There's some ambiguity about conditions on design issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| such as landscaping, materials, other site and design conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| but uses should not be conditioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| So basically, and also, if they were trying to rezone it to an R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| to allow a single-family residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| that would have to go through a sector plan change, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Okay, so what we're doing tonight is making it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| for the applicant to build a single-family residence on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| but the future uses could be everything that's allowed under the O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| So I just wanted everybody on council to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| So we have a motion and a second to approve 12P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| Council, nobody has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| So before he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| We've got a little more than 30 minutes to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181106?start=5013)|
