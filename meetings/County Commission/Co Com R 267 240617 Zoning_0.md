| 0:03:00| Moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| We do have several signed up, and as is typically the process with zoning, we hold those until the item is actually read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=183)|
| 0:03:13| and then you'll have an opportunity at that point to speak directly as the item is being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| Does anyone out there have any objection to that, that's signed up for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=199)|

| 0:04:15| so without objection, we will go to item 3 and then back to item 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| Item number 3 is a request of Jonathan Harper for rezoning from A Agricultural to RA Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=262)|

| 0:06:44| Seeing none, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the name change of the unnamed easement to Dubusque Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| as requested by the Knox County Emergency Communications District by a vote of 12-0 in consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Mr. Anders, if you'd address this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| So, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| What we're doing, we're going through and we're finding some errors in our addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| This one goes back into the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| The Royal Industries built, obviously built numerous facilities on that area and gave it a Dubusque Lane address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| The county actually went and hung a sign as Dubusque Lane, but it's never been officially adopted as Dubusque Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| and there's another Dubusque Lane out west of Knoxville where we were sending fire trucks to the wrong address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| And so to cure that, it's more economical, more efficient to name this Dubusque Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| and go out to the west Knoxville Dubusque Lane, and there's an application, I believe, next month to rename that Dubusque Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| There's one in Commissioner Daley's district that's a broken block range on two different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| one's in Vestal, one's near Johnson Bible College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| It's the same street name, very similar numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| We sent the ambulance to the wrong location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| So we're trying to get those cured as many as we can find as quickly as we can find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| So you'll see some more of this over the next six or eight months, trying to repair some broken response plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=486)|
| 0:08:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Commissioners, are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| Seeing none, I'll turn this over to Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=500)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| I have really no questions as far as this, and I'd make a motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=509)|
| 0:08:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| We have a motion to approve as presented by Lee, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Your motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=530)|

| 0:08:53| The decorating is very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| They didn't ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=537)|

| 0:15:46| Just a question of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| So will you be accessing this parcel from Cooper's Meadows subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| And have you spoken with those residents and informed them of what you're planning to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| and actually talked to them about how they feel about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| So personally, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=962)|

| 0:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| I would really like for you all to have that conversation before we actually vote on something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| I think having community input is very important, especially if you're accessing their cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| That's something that I know I would like to see, but I don't know if my colleagues agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| So unless you want to, I mean, I guess the district commissioner would have to decide what to do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=986)|
| 0:16:37| But those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=997)|

| 0:16:46| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| That would be addressed in the next stage, correct, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1008)|

| 0:19:13| So am I missing something here, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| I'm very disturbed by the fact that Planning Commission approved PR up to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| after we just spent two years reviewing our land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| and then they basically ignored the updated plans designation of rural living at two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| I think that that jeopardizes the integrity of our efforts and the Planning Commission as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| and, quite frankly, this Commission if we were to accept that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| I do not support Planning Commission's recommendation of three because it's not consistent with the newly updated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1192)|
| 0:20:02| Director Brooks, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| Are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| I have a question, Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| Was this filed before or after the passing of our new growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| It was filed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Your staff recommended that this property be rezoned for a maximum of two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1237)|
| 0:20:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| And the reasoning for it in the documents provided to us was it was not consistent with the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1248)|
| 0:20:59| So our staff recommended two because they stated that it was consistent with the plan, the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| That's not what I'm looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| If you look at the documents that were provided to the County Commission, it says consistent with land use plan, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| This is not consistent with the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| So the comprehensive plan, the one that is currently in effect that was recently adopted, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| This would not be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| So the staff got it right at two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| Planning Commission recommended up to three because they wanted to know what the consensus was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| I understand, but they're just an advisory body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| But your paid staff that you hired, they're the ones that said two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| And I would say we are also advisory as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| We advise the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| So I guess the question for the law director would be, because this has now been our new comprehensive land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1314)|
| 0:22:06| and growth plan has been adopted by the state of Tennessee, if we vote anything different than what that plan says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| are we violating state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| It's the growth plan that is the mandate you have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| The comprehensive plan, there's a little bit more wiggle room with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| but the statute says that land use decisions must be consistent with the adopted growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| So I'd have to ask Director Brooks, what would the maximum under the growth plan be for this parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1355)|
| 0:22:47| I think your microphone is off, or I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Oh, sorry. Let me move it closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| It is within the planned growth area, but the place type is rural living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| which allows consideration of planned residential up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| That's for the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| That's under the growth plan or the comprehensive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| The comprehensive plan, but it is within the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| So if it's in the planned growth area, there isn't the two or one limitation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Okay. So at that point, I would think best practice is you'd want to follow what the comprehensive plan says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1396)|
| 0:23:28| but I don't think that you're mandated to do that by state law in the same way that you are with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1408)|
| 0:23:39| But I thought we had voted as part of the growth plan for the rural residential in that area for two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1419)|
| 0:23:53| Yes, under the newly adopted comprehensive plan, it is the place type is rural living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| which only allows consideration up to two dwelling units per acre per that comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1438)|
| 0:24:09| And this is what we're supposed to be moving forward to, not going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| We're supposed to be doing anything in that whole quadrant land area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| It's a maximum of two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| I just don't understand how this body could then just decide that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| we're going to not follow the two units an acre for the future here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| So I'm hoping some of my colleagues will have some insight or additional thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| I imagine this will only happen for a couple of months with this overlap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| but Mr. Moyers, is there sort of a grandfather timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| I mean, if this was submitted before that was approved, does it fall under the old rules or the new rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1498)|
| 0:25:07| As regards to the comprehensive plan, you could potentially say that it might be grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| if it was applied for before the plan was adopted, but that is not the case with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| The growth plan, the statute on the growth plan says that once you adopt the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| all your land use decisions have to be consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| As it happens with this piece of property, the growth plan isn't an impediment itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| because this is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| So could you say that since this was applied for prior to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| I'm unaware of any mandate in state law regarding the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| that is black and white in the way that it is with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| So I think you have more room to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| Having said that, you have adopted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| You need to have some valid reason for going away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| As I say, if this was applied for before, you could find that it is grandfathered under the old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| I don't think there would be a legal prescription against that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| but I think there would be with regard to the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| With the growth plan, you could not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Once the growth plan goes into effect, you must comply with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| That's the minimum, the base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Again, can you repeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Under the growth plan, what are the density levels, the planned growth area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1587)|
| 0:26:39| This particular piece of property is in the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| so it's not limited to two dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| If it was in the rural area, it would be limited, but the planned growth area is not limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| So if you all were to move forward with this rezoning as recommended by planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| we would recommend it at some point in the near future we do a plan amendment to match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| This is stuck between like every plan and right in the middle of timing and blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1624)|
| 0:27:13| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Is it correct that the staff recommended two on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Okay, and the reason was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| Well, a primary reason for us was we were in the midst of creating this new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| and so we did take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| It was one of the considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Okay, that the place type under the comprehensive plan would limit it to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Yeah, I mean, look, I think if we have a comprehensive plan, we need to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| That's what I promised my constituents was that we would wed the growth plan to the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| And I've even been on record as saying that those that attempted to get under the wire at the 11th hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| while the spirit of these plans was underway, I would not look favorably on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| And I think the new comprehensive plan is what we need to abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| I think last month's a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I think we went all the way down to the minutia of our plans last month on a particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1700)|
| 0:28:29| Not really even sure if I agreed with the decision we made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| but it was a moot point because the applicant withdrew their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| But if we're going to do that, then I don't think we need to depart from the comprehensive plan a month later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| So I agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| Excuse me, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Can I interject real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| I believe this body, I think it was two or three months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| for a larger piece just down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| And so for consistency, we feel that this does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| I was going to defer to Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| I can't say much more than what Commissioner Buehler said, that we agreed to follow these new plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| And if we start burying now, what's going to happen in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| And the planning commissioners that vote on these, they're going to have to start following these plans also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Because we can't, we spent a million bucks, two years to come up with these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| and I think they're a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| I think it's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| But we've got to follow each commission, the new commission, this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| and the planning commissioners that vote, they need to follow these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| And I agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I can't see that it be no more than the two that the plan has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1791)|
| 0:30:00| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Director Brooks, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| For the rural living, don't we have more than one set of restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1803)|
| 0:30:14| We can go up to PR5 in some cases and PR1 in other cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| Or is that wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I might think it's something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| Let me just double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Are you asking about the plan residential up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| Yeah, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| It's up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| And then I'm thinking of something else then probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Never mind then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| So, Director Brooks, to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| this application was submitted before the plan was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1862)|
| 0:31:14| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| I just wanted to point out staff's recommendation aligns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| with the land use classification of ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| The future land use is rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| So two units per acre aligns with the old sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| and the new place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| So I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| I have a question for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| I thought that I'm asking that if an applicant presents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1920)|
| 0:32:17| on a sector plan, which I know no longer exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| but a sector plan and a zoning that would be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1944)|
| 0:32:36| under that came with the property that we were charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| with having to, we could not change the rights of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| once they, if they already had their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| That dealt with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Just the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| That dealt with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| So what was expressed in all of these documents was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| if you have a piece of property, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| that's already zoned PR density six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| and under the growth plan and the new comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| the most you could have would be four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| you would not lose that six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| We're not going to down zone anybody's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| by the adoption of these new maps and growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| But going forward, we should comply with the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| Now, this is an unusual case because it was applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| for under the old comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| and I'm being told it was consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| with the old comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| So this body could, if it wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| find that it's grandfathered because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| This is a situation that we shouldn't see much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| after the next month or two, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| All of those should be cleared out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| This is just kind of an unusual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| But I was just looking at the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| and again, I don't see anything that mandates compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| with the general plan in the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| that the statutes mandate compliance with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| So I think you're free actors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| You can do whatever you think is most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| So to be clear, we are mandated to follow the new growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| But if zoning presented was the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2059)|
| 0:34:28| as what came with the property, even if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| a change in the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| I think what I'm trying to say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| if this rezoning complies with the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| then at three an acre, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| if that complies with the growth plan, I'm told that it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| then you're safe to act on that as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| Where we are is I'm being told that this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| this density would have been consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| with the comprehensive plan that was in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| when it was applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| It has since, you know, we've adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| a new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| I think this body could legally consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| that this application was grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| and considered under the old comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| or this body could find, no, we've adopted a new plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| and we're going to be consistent with that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| I think this body can do either one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| I don't know if I can make it much plainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| I think you can do that because what I'm being told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| is that the three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| is consistent with the new growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| and that's the only thing that you, by statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| must comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| Now, I think that you should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and maybe people might make an argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| that you must comply with the new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| I'm not going to argue with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| but I do believe that given the unique circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| that this was applied for for a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| that would have been legal at the time that it was applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| you could, if you wished, find that it's grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| without setting too much of a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| because, as I say, this is a very small class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| of applications that are going to be coming through the pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| that were applied for before we made the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I think this body could legally take that into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| if you wished, or you could properly follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| the current comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| and say that's the most we're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I think you can do either one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| depending on what you think is most fair and most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| Thank you. Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Mr. Moyers, I'm going to respectfully disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| For months, we have been counseled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| that we were eliminating sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| with the adoption of the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| They were removed from our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| so I'm quite confused as to why we're still referencing sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2224)|
| 0:37:13| I do not think we have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I do not think that we should teeter back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| We need to firmly plant our decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| on what we have spent two years determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| is the best use of our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| That's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| I hope that my colleagues will agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| But we can't keep saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| oh, you can kind of look at the sector plan and this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| but you're going to have to remove them from your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| We're not going to reference them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| You can't consider them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| We invested a lot of money, a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| in creating a new comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| and I think we need to stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| I agree with Commissioner Fraser's two times of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| I think the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| has been aware of this process for two years with advanced NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| I appreciate Commissioner Beeler's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| that potentially people were trying to bring some in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| on the last minute, kind of in the back door, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| to try to run something through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| even though they've known for two years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| what this is all going to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| all of the zoning and the land use requirements for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| So I'm prepared to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| to approve the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| at up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| second by Commissioner Fraser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| to accept a recommendation up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Correct, as the staff said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Is there any further discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2373)|

| 0:40:24| would you go ahead and read your recommendation, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2427)|

| 0:40:33| because it's consistent with the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| by a vote of 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2436)|

| 0:41:53| and searching for our forever home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| We have spent 22 years of our marriage living less than 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| from our closest neighbor, and the one thing we know for certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| is we wanted enough land to guarantee our privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| We bought this property with the understanding that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| no immediate danger of the surrounding property being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| Undisclosed to us, there were already development plans in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| Had we known this, we would not have purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| Unfortunately, now we find ourselves stuck in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| and while we understand we do not control the use of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| owned by others, we also don't want the value of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| and our level of privacy diminished by the development of said property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| The reasons we oppose this development include but are not limited to the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Number one, the diminishment of our property value from having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| a dense subdivision development less than 100 feet from my back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| Number two, the environmental damage associated with having a hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| protection area developed in such close proximity to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| Number three, the environmental damage associated with having a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| in such close proximity of a protected blue line stream adjacent to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2591)|
| 0:43:20| Number four, the danger created by the extra traffic caused by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Black Square Road, as it currently exists, is barely wide enough for two cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| to pass each other without slowing down or one car moving to the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| The additional traffic will make this road much more treacherous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Number five, the extended danger created by the additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| at the intersection of Blacks Ferry and West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Currently, when pulling onto West Emory Road from Blacks Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| you have to proceed without being able to see the oncoming traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| due to the blind curve on West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| This development will only exacerbate this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| Number six, last but not least, we oppose this development due to the loss of privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| leading to the diminished personal enjoyment of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| I stand before you tonight to ask that the rezoning required for this planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| is not allowed to proceed without guaranteed protection boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| and barriers to prevent the diminished value to our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| and the loss of personal enjoyment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| We are very open to discussion on these matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| and we hope this can be resolved amicably, but make no mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| we have the motivation, the determination, and the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| to fight this through all legal paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dossey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2692)|
| 0:45:00| Commissioners, are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| You can sit down right this minute, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Just looking at this property, Director Brooks, can you clarify for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| how many acres of this property is actually buildable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| I can't tell you what percentage of this is buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| I can tell you how many acres are within the hillside, non-hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| I can tell you what percentage is in the 0 to 15%, 15 to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| So looking at the topography, the blue line stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| it seems to run through the flatter area of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Yes, there's two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| So that would have to be addressed during the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Can you clarify what the protections are for those blue line streams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| I will defer to my colleague in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Yes, the stream buffers will apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| so there will be a 50-foot buffer applied to the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| To both streams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| To both streams, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| And I saw it was noted there are several environmental constraints as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| and the future land use map is rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| This question is for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| When you look at the shape of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| there's potentially for two entrances or exits from that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| Which will engineering most likely recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| I think we would wait until we got the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| and make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| but we would probably prefer the one furthest to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| And for the record, would you give us your name and department, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| Steve Elliott, Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Thank you, Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| And then I have a question for Mr. Dawsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| Is your house, there's two houses that separate the entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| Is yours the one in the middle between the two entrances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| My house is on the right-hand side of the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| There's a smaller house and then my house is the white house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| with black trim to the right at 7533 Black's Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| We own an L-shaped piece of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| We have an easement on the driveway that goes down immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| I guess, to the left after you cross the stream there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| is where the property starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| That's right at 100 feet from my back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| So my big concern about this is the development of the lower side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Has the developer or anyone contacted you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| about the potential development, Commissioner, or Mr. Dawsey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| When we bought the property, on top of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| this was not disclosed to us either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| We asked this specific question and this was not disclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| at that time either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| So quite frankly, I'm in a position here that I'm not happy to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Mr. Elliott, that 50-foot buffer on that blue-lime stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| that's going to actually be 50 on each side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Yes, 50 on each side, so about 100-foot buffer total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| That's not a variance either, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| They can disturb the outer 25 but the inner 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| so the inner 50 feet of it would be do not disturb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| other than for utilities or some sort of approved crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| with an ARAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| So nothing can be built in that 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Nothing can be built in the outer 25 either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| but it can be disturbed and graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| I know this is a tough question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| but do you think that there might be any variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| that would have to come out of the cause of the hilltop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| That's a tough question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| Mr. Stanton, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=2969)|

| 0:50:02| Yes, that was Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| They requested five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| Just a moment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3012)|
| 0:50:23| I'm looking at considerations, additional considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3023)|
| 0:50:31| page 10-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| While the sector plan was the active plan at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| of the request, Knox County Comprehensive Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| became effective April 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| This property has an RC, rural conservation place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| which allows consideration of the PR zone with a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| I'm also reading that it acknowledges 3.9 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3059)|
| 0:51:17| of hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| And the tract, I believe, is eight acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| I believe that was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3082)|
| 0:51:30| If we were to approve this today under our current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| what would be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| The place type is rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| So rural conservation does allow consideration up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| which is what the applicant is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| Madam Chair, to answer your question a little bit differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| rural conservation PR up to five is only partially related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| meaning the zoning district may be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| but with qualifications such as development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| So it's not directly related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| Mr. Elliott, could you speak to Blacksberry Road, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| We spoke with the developer prior to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| meeting, and we informed them that we would ask for some road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| improvements from their entrance back out to Emory Road at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| development plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| We would also want to look at the intersection at Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| and ask they participate in trying to improve that sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| distance at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| It is not very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| It's not good even a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| It's substandard today, so we would ask they participate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| us in making that better, improving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| So if it's substandard at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| is this information that planning had when they were looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| this, or is it a consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| Yes, it was one of the considerations that we took into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| consideration when we made the recommendation of less than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| the applicant was requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| We review all of our rezoning applications with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3210)|
| 0:53:41| Mr. Dossi, I see where your property is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| and I certainly understand your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| Mr. Stanton, has there been any discussion with the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3230)|
| 0:53:58| that you're surrounding there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| It's difficult to do that when we have no idea what our density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| will be because it fluctuates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| So no, ma'am, not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3245)|
| 0:54:20| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| To our engineering and public works department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| we talked about this intersection, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| several years ago when we were talking about North Hampton Commons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| and sort of further up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| And a better portion of why this intersection sight lines are quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| difficult, if you're coming out of Blacks Ferry and you look to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| west, you have a significant berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| but you also have a big chunk of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| But especially if you're looking to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| it's almost entirely based upon the wood over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| We talked about clearing, having that cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| but are we not able to do that because of the easement with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| state route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| I think looking back to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| in order to remove that vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| we'd have to be on someone else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| What about to the east?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| To the east, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| I feel like we talked about going ahead and improving the sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| distance regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| It looks like to the east we could probably accomplish that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| removing some vegetation that is within the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| I think we ought to do that anyway regardless of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| It's something we talked about a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| and I respectfully request you add that to the list of things to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| If we have the ability to do it and the right to be able to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| that right-of-way, we ought to help that intersection regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| But thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| In our documents it says that Blacks Ferry is 16 feet to possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| You in your discussion said that you have had conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| the developer about improving the road down to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| In previous times we've had discussions from engineering to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| developer, and they've made promises that were never held up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| and then Knox County got stuck with the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Is there anything that's in concrete that says they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| to provide X number of dollars funding to improve that road down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| to Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Not at this time, but if you make that a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| we will not sign a plat until that condition is met or we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| adequate bond to ensure the work is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Because otherwise it's just kind of a hearsay agreement that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| yeah, I'll improve the road, just give me the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| but I don't really have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| This work would require an MOU from the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| They would have to enter into an MOU with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| They would provide the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| We would manage the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| And I believe those MOUs come back before this body once we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| agreed upon it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| Correct, Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Come back before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I thought they did, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I thought that was the new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| They came back and you guys approved them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| We've never voted on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Between the developer and Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| So I guess my question then, to make sure I got a clear answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| the developer can say they want to participate on improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Blacksberry Pike, as it's called, but there's no legal authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| to make them do that at this point in time if we approve that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| We have the road ordinance that was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| the off-site improvements ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| They would have to enter into an MOU with us and provide the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Then we would manage the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| That ordinance was adopted May of 23, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| But they could, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| And I'm positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| I thought those MOUs came back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| I've never seen one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| But we've never seen an MOU from a developer to come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| So would the road improvements have to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| before construction on the homes began?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| Yes, we would want to see those completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| before people are occupying those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| I am very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| I understand that in a developer's eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| that eight acres is probably not a huge project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| and perhaps I don't ‑‑ I just ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| I cannot do this as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| Blacks Ferry Road is absolutely maxed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3562)|
| 0:59:30| And I think we can condition the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| I do think that that is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| I am concerned about adequate buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| between not only Mr. Dossey's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| but the people that are sandwiched between those two easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3588)|
| 0:59:58| Have you even given any thought to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3598)|
| 1:00:06| Because you're going to be clustering a huge amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| right at the bottom of that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| We don't know that yet, but we have thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| And it's tough for us to go to all this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| if we get shut down to one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| then it's not feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| and so we've wasted a ton of time and money in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| But we have spoken with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| We improve roads on most of our subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| You can look at Asheville Highway, Brackett Road, several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| We do have MOUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| and we just spend a lot of our money out of pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| to create some sort of agreement with all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| We're open to buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| We do that constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| We're more than happy to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| but at this present stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| it's really difficult to make any concrete promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| because we have no real idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| And I appreciate what you're saying, Mr. Stanton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| although it only takes really a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| and a meeting with a few of the residents around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| That is not a cost-prohibitive type of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| These people up that road have just been beat to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| I mean, they just have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| And that's not a reflection on your firm at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| It just is a fact of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| Is it appropriate for me to request a postponement on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| and condition it on them speaking with the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3694)|
| 1:01:42| You're a member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| If you wish to move for deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| you have as much right as anybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| I would like to make a motion for a 30-day deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3710)|
| 1:02:05| to be heard at the July 15 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3725)|
| 1:02:19| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| My encouragement is that you contact the surrounding neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| and talk with them about something you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| to make them feel a little more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| I really, I do support development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| I hate to just turn it down flat like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| but there's just got to be some communication with others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| So my motion is to defer until the July zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| We have a proper motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3786)|

| 1:04:16| I just wanted to make sure they were all sworn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3856)|

| 1:04:44| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| the 3-hour plan residential zone up to $120 per acre because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| consistent with the rural residential land use classification and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3890)|

| 1:05:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| On behalf of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| we're requesting a rezoning to plan residential at a density of up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| The designation for this property under the growth policy plan is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| the rural area designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| I would point out that it is within a few hundred feet of the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| growth area boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| This request at two units an acre does satisfy the requirements under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| the growth policy plan for the allowance of up to two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| The new land use designation for the property is rural living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| which we discussed at length this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| The primary type of residential zoning for the rural living is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| planned residential up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| The property presently has a split zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| It's about equally divided where half of the property has the old RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| the general residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| and the other half is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| So it's about 40 acres in the RB and a little over 40 acres in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| currently is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| As you're aware, the RB zone is a use by right zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| One of those use by right, there are several of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| but one of the use by rights is that it does allow a multifamily up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| meaning today that the property owner and the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| whoever has the interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| could go and submit a building permit for the development of an apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| development here at up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| With the 40 acres, that would be up to 480 apartment units on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| The land use designation of rural living, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| identifies the planned residential at two units as an appropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| The RB zoning, if you look at those land use designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| just to kind of show how much more intensive the RB zoning district is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| those land use designations are traditional neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| corridor mixed use, town center mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| suburban mixed residential, and corridor commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| So the majority of those are more commercially based zoning designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| that are contemplated under the RB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| and the residential neighborhood ones are the more intensive residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| at much higher densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| The planned residential rezoning for the property at two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| is notably a lot less intense or dense of a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| than what could be developed there by right under the existing RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| As you're aware, with the planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| unlike the RB zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| we have to go through development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| where different plans are submitted, grading plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| The subdivision layout plans are required to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Those are approved by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Also, as part of that, based on this zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| for this type of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| it would also require a traffic impact study to be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| That would be prepared by an engineer and submitted to the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| and for the planning commission to adopt those recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| those requirements that are set forth in that traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| This also would provide for additional public review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| public input at the planning commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| where the planning commissioners would consider the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| and the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| Submit that the request at planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| at two dwelling units per acre is consistent with the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| and is consistent with the new comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| We request that you rezone the property from the RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| and agricultural zoning to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| at a density of up to two dwelling units per acre for the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| because it is consistent with the comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| If opposition would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| If you'd introduce yourself and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| My name is Darren Maroney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| I live at the Old White Farmhouse at 704 Highland View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| So I live 156 feet from 8922 Pickens Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| The interesting thing about this is the advanced plan was designated 8922,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| and I believe the outer edge of my property is agricultural, not for RB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| So I actually have a legal question that I would like an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| With the new advanced NOx plan, does it eliminate the RB zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| I think that's a fair question, Law Director Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4215)|
| 1:10:24| Let me add one extra caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| My property is also RB zoning, which we will be changing in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| My understanding, first of all, we are getting ready to do a new comprehensive rewrite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| of the zoning, the whole zoning code, and it may or may not include an RB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| But one thing that was made clear throughout the process of adopting a new growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| and a comprehensive plan was that nobody's property zoning, current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| was going to be affected by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| So that property that was RB is still RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| And potentially you could zone other property currently to RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| if it was consistent with the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| That will change or may change when we do the new overall zoning rewrite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| But currently that RB zone is still there and active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| Thank you for the clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| So the NOx County Planning Group recommended this be a one dwelling unit per acre property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| It's a fantastic property. It's gorgeous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| My wife and I bought our house a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| We thought the property was set, it was intact, young family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| Something happened, they decided to sell. It's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| It's going to change South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| Once the quality is taken away, it can never be put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| So I'm going to ask about that in thinking about the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| I've had many conversations with the shulers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| They've been wonderful. They've been gracious in talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| We've talked about different plans and different ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| We have different ideas as to what fits there properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| So as to the number of cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Knox County Planning said there's going to be 1,600 cars a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| in and out of that particular process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| That goes all the way up Pickens Gap to Tarleton Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| brings a right-hand turn, goes out to East Hendron Chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| That's 4.7 miles of a single stream of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| That's part of the impact that's coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| For development, I'm not going to argue that, but do it appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| So with that, I'm going to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| and if we could add some massive landscape barriers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| if you do approve two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| because they're also going to take down a massive ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| that separates the view of my property from theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| Thank you very much for your time and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| All right. Stop the clock, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| There was about two minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| If you'd like to use the rest of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| Well, you're the one standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4390)|

| 1:13:24| I'm also a lawyer in town, but I am not representing the community in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4404)|
| 1:13:31| In fact, it's not the area of law that I practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| so I really don't have the basis of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| But I am here as a member of the community because, well, initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| there was massive objection from the community about the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| and we understand that MPC is recommending one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| and that was partly protective because of the RB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| And so we get that, and if we must go with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| then we ask you at least to follow the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| But we also understood from the Shulers that they pulled the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| in order to get the two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| which would allow 168 houses on this 40-acre very rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| that is outside the advanced NOx planning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| We are in the agricultural rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| the area that's supposed to be protected from the sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| but the two units per acre would put 160 acres on this very rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| that sits right next to the gap on Pickens Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| which is something that if you've never been out that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| it's very difficult to go through this very sharp, steep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| it's got edges and it turns, and there's no real side on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| Two cars can't really pass in that area, and the entrance to that is right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| not to mention there's no way to get on and off Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| unless you travel four miles to get to a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| But in any event, we simply ask that if we have to go with the one unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| that was recommended, we will live with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| but please don't go for the two units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| that is being asked for by Heartland Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| because it's a very agricultural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| You can't see the other subdivisions from that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| I'm sorry, Bobby, can I save one minute or one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| Sir, if you'd still like to speak, maybe 30, 45 seconds, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| I'll give you a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| Mr. Taylor, I'll give you a minute or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Madam Chair, it's a point of privilege to let Mr. Smeltzer speak also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| I just said I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| I'm assuming that very few of you all have visited that part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| Would you introduce yourself, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| I'm Bobby Smeltzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| I was raised in Tarkin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| My family's old home place, and I spent some time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| So I could tell you a whole lot about the whole neighborhood as far as that goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| but the problem I see with this is that it is outside of the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| and the fact that everything around there is agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| and how in the world it ever got zoned like it did back in the 60s or whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| I have not a clue, neither does anybody here have a clue of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| But everything out there is pretty much agriculture, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| and the commission has said, you know, one house per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| and I think that that's something that we could all live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| I myself have made a living working with developers and working with builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| and, you know, that's just been my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| So I understand, but I don't want that part of town to look like what Hardin Valley does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| and a lot of the other places because we don't have the roads to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| We have one red light to get on Chapman Highway from that side of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| unless you drive another two miles, and then you've got narrow roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| and you can come out at Lowe's or Food City there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| and that's the only other red light other than the one at Henderson Chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| So, you know, I was for a road being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| and that's what we were promised when the South Knoxville road came across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| the bridge came across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Please wrap it up, sir, quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| But that got stopped, but my point is traffic, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| If you've not ever traveled Chapman Highway, we get Pigeon Forge traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| we get Isle of Seymour traffic, we get Blount County traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| and we're loaded up with traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| and we have no other roads to come into Knoxville unless you choose crooked roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| So we could live with one house breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| Mr. Forrester, did you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| Do we have any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| I did have a chance to drive out there and take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| I just wanted to point out, too, first, I think RB is too broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| and it's often used without adequate justification, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| and I hope that we really closely look at that when we do create the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| Second of all, I just want to point out policy 3.3 of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| It allows two units per acre in the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| with reductions in density when a site has steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| The slope analysis is recommending a density of 1.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| and the growth plan max density is 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| So I think that planning got it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| recommending one unit per acre subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| The steep slopes remain undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| I would even discuss additional conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| if this body thinks that it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| so that we do protect any adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| possibly with some sort of landscape screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| A question for engineering again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| Pickens Gap Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| is it currently designed to handle the over 1,600 vehicle trips per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| out of that development at that requested two units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| I would say to the west, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| To the east, going into Sevier County, it gets narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| We've not seen a traffic impact analysis yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| so as part of the scoping for that study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| we've asked them to evaluate road widths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| and what the impact of this traffic will be on those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| Are they in that 22-foot, or are they the 16 to 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| Because I couldn't see it in any notes here where you guys put that in the paperwork for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| I had some guys go measure it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| and from Tarquin Valley back to Tipton Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| it averages between 24 and 26 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| From Tarquin Valley to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| and I'm sorry, is that Blount or Sevier County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Sevier, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| It's about 17 feet wide back that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| And that is asphalt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Yes, that's asphalt. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| I'm struggling with this one because I feel like we're about to hit a repeat button of what happened last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| where you can have the thing that you don't like the most, which is there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| or the thing you don't like as well over here, which is the thing potentially to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| And we just went through this where this body decided to sort of stick to the absolute XYZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4851)|
| 1:21:00| and it gave exactly everything that the neighbors did not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| And so Commissioner Daley always says R.B. is the worst zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| and I tend to agree in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| And somebody could go and put a tremendous amount of apartments on there like tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| and it would never come to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| It is like a buy-write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| They just fill out the paperwork and go for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| and it is the worst thing that you guys do not, I promise you, do not want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| So I have an applicant sort of saying half of it's ag and half of it's R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| and, you know, we want to throw all that away for two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| which is exactly the rural density that we've sort of overlaid in the whole county in our new growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4900)|
| 1:21:48| But if you do nothing, you know, then you could have the worst thing ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| which is a whole bunch of apartments out in the middle of a really, you know, rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| So I'm really ‑‑ I'd love to hear the district commissioner's opinion on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| because I'm inclined to agree with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| so that the other thing that is ten times worse doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| but I also understand the one and two and the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| So I'm really ‑‑ I'm stuck on this, and I'd love to hear your opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| This is your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| I kind of echo the same thing that Commissioner Jay just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Do you want 400 and something units of apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| and then the agricultural will get developed into one unit an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| so you're going to have, you know, 450, 500 units, you know, 1,000 plus cars just in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| or do you want 160?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| Similar to last week, this is why I always think the opinion of the 11s is a lot better than just black and white text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| But I think the two units an acre, the neighborhood would be a lot happier with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| versus 400 apartments and plus housing and everything else in there personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| But, again, I'd like to defer to the district commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| I just want to point out again that the growth plan and the growth map is regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=4992)|
| 1:23:21| 1.2 is the max density according to the growth plan that this body should approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5001)|
| 1:23:30| Anything other than that, you are moving away from the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5010)|
| 1:23:40| Using the example from last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| several of you voted with moving away from the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| because you felt like that's what was best for the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| It is our duty to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| It is the duty and responsibility of the applicant and the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| to understand what is happening, to ask questions, to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| I hate to say it that way, but that's kind of on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| We are here to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| The growth plan and the growth map, it is regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| So understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| But as I said last month, and I'll say it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| we are not here to negotiate away from the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5074)|
| 1:24:44| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| I'll make a comment on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| I don't think we did a good job then because I feel like we're elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| to take all these things into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| and maybe we need to adjust the law because here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| If we're going to go and not give them the two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| they'll pull it like they did last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| and then these people are going to be stuck with 400-plus apartment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| I feel like this is going to keep coming up month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| We're going to get different situations like this where, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| the common sense logical thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| which might not be appliable from the law that we put together a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| well, maybe the law needs to be adjusted so that we can have some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| leeway on making good decisions for good growth because in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| I think everybody would agree that a 400-unit apartment building wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| good growth for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| I highly think that you think of 400, but that's what the case is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| But we don't have the gray area or the leeway to make that decision we put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| black and white paper into place, and that's what we have to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| which the citizens elected us for our judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| not just to follow the black and white paper when it doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| I feel like this is going to be repeat, repeat, repeat over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| but just stating my opinion on the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| To Commissioner Ward's comment, I think that's what the AFGN is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| I think he's trying to look at where we want to grow and how we can grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| and that's why he or she offered the rezoning of PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| Yeah, two an acre is what they requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| I think they're trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Well, have we heard from them that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| I think they're trying to do a good thing, like what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| They have the right vision, which I think is the right vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| but what you just said is we can't give them the right vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| even though we all think it's probably the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| and they're not going to be able to make enough money off the one unit an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| They're much better off selling the property at the RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| and making a lot more money off the RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| I think that's something I would like to hear from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| from the applicant, the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| Are they supportive of the staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| No, we're asking for PR, two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5241)|
| 1:27:33| Any other questions or comments before I turn it to Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| Commissioner Daly, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| This is, like you've heard me say before, and I voted against last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| and I know I'll vote again next month on RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| RB is the worst zoning, and when it comes to the use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| I don't look at, you know, I've been accused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| and we all have been accused of looking at developers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| I don't look at developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| I don't look at applicants or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| I look at the use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| If RB stays with this land, it could be sold two or three times down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| and RBs will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| It's always going to be there, and somebody at RB is going to develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| either it's two years from now, three years from now, or five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5311)|

| 1:28:54| 24 to 26 foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5334)|

| 1:29:02| You know, and on the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| it may be that we have to look at putting a red light there at Highland View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| and that's a very good possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| There will be a red light there soon as the other development around Chapman Plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5354)|

| 1:29:22| Once it starts growing, I can foresee Highland View taking a sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| not a sharp right, but a right up to the top of the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| and there's going to be a red light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| It's going to make entrance and exits a whole lot safer there at Highland View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5372)|

| 1:30:08| I don't look at things being a threat or not a threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| because we hear threats all the time at Peral County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| It is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| Forty acres of it is zoned R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| I don't like R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| I'm going to make the motion for P.R. at 2 so I can get rid of that R.B. zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| because Heartland is in the development business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| It's what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| They're there to develop the land and sell it off to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| And if that R.B. stays there, somebody eventually will build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| We're growing in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Like it or not, I've been a South Knoxvillian for 60 years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| I'll be 65 here pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| I wished it was the same as it always has been, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| But I can promise you I don't want to see R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| I don't want to see R.B. on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| I don't want to see R.B. on Pickens Gap, Highland View, anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| It's not a fit, and I think Director Brooks, I talked to her one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| we don't even know where the R.B. came from, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5475)|
| 1:31:22| Director Brooks, we can build on R.B. trailers, tiny homes, storage container homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5482)|
| 1:31:30| townhouses, apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| We got R.B. there on John Sevier Highway that they're building container homes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5493)|
| 1:31:42| And they don't look good, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| They're container homes, and they're not a fit to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| And I just don't like R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| And I'm asking you to do away with R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| And the R.R. Rural Residential gives us the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5518)|
| 1:32:05| to approve up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| That's what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| So I am going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| I see Commissioner Schoonmaker's light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| Do you have a comment or just kind of go ahead and make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| I'll yield to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| And I guess it's for you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| Based on the testimony of Commissioner Fraser, how legally I'm not comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| with voting for something more than 1.2 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| because of the constraints of not wanting to violate the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| and the rules that we've now adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| How does that look to the people in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| where we went through this whole process for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| we finally got together, made a unanimous decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| and then we don't want to follow the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| And I know there's a lot here of us that some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| want to be a commissioner again on September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| So how do they go back to their constituents and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| hey, it's supposed to be 1.2, but you didn't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| You voted for 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| I don't understand why, where Commissioner Fraser is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| It's in the notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| When the R.R., when the rural residential says that a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| can have up to two dwelling units an acre, is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| Mr. Law Director, can they have up to two dwelling units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Well, I would defer to Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| I think it's a general rule, but as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| this property is limited by some slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Ms. Brooks, what's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| This is where it gets a little complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| because we've been in the midst of transitioning from plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| So when this application came in under the old plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| and there was a section in the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| that was in effect at the time, it's policy 3.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| that did speak to limiting density on certain slope percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5660)|
| 1:34:28| So that was the plan in effect at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| I think it's a little confusing, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| because the staff report also references the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| which is based on the Hillside Ridge Top Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| which is not an adopted plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| It's a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| So the new growth policy plan does not have that same section, policy 3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| 3.3, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| So in staff's opinion, the place type is rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| It's in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| The consideration can be up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| Planning Commission and staff are not recommending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| But there's no slope limitation that would prevent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| in the new growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Since I was asking you a question and you answered it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| can I then follow up where I was basing my comments on the 1.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| In reading by the information that was provided by NOx Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| on page 21-3, it says down towards the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| the maximum density allowed based on the policy 3.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| of the growth policy plan is approximately 1.2 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5743)|
| 1:35:54| But that's not what the notes say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| The notes say the proposed amendments should be consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| and not in conflict with the general plan of Knoxville-Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| Ms. Brooks, when the staff developed these notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| was it before the adoption of the new growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| If you notice, it's an April case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| So that explains the disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| They were looking at a policy that was under the old growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| where the slope would have been taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| and these policy 3.3 would have been taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| But that is policy 3.3 under the old growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| And this is another one of those weird cases where we had something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| going through before we adopted the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| All of our decisions now have to be consistent with the new growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| And if policy 3.3 that's referenced here is not part of the new growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| then it does not limit the maximum density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| The maximum density would be 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| Now that doesn't mean you're required to give 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| You can still give 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| You can give half if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| But it would appear to me that that 1.2 is based on verbiage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| that was in the old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| And so that no longer applies since the new plan was put into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5832)|
| 1:37:22| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Did you have anything else to respond directly to his comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| No, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Director Brooks, if the motion is made up to two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| this will be decided at concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| Concept plan, you can go, even though the ridgetop hilltop is not a binding document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| it's still being used today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| Staff uses it to guide our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Staff does use it to guide our recommendations at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| and at the next stage as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| So it's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| It's up to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| That will happen at concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| And that concept plan is where the property owner brings it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| and another opportunity where R.B. gives us zero opportunity to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5899)|
| 1:38:27| Mr. Forrester, road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| Is the property on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| Well, are you willing to do the road improvements that I know the section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| You could probably come out and I would think that Mr. Elliott might agree that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| if there is interest there, it should come out at Tarklin Valley and Pickens Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5929)|
| 1:38:56| There's no use having two entrances, one on the east end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| and one kind of on the south end or north end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| It should come out in a straight, and that's the width of the road, 24 to 26 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| But if there's road improvements, you're willing to do those type of road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| I mean, we'll have to do the traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| which we'll have to follow the kind of requests that Knox County Engineering will put into those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| for what they want us to search and then what those improvements or recommendations come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| Yes, we'll follow the recommendations of the traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| and the requirements of Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| I believe also that during one of our meetings that there was discussion of a buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5979)|
| 1:39:47| Are you willing to, in the concept plan, to do a buffer zone around the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5987)|
| 1:39:55| Of course, on the hillside, you're not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| I can't foresee anything happening on the hillside at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| So there's not really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| The need for a buffer zone will be on where Mr. Maroney's property line is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| which will be the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| Yeah, we'll have the peripheral setback through the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| submitting the concept plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| and determining kind of the layout as to what makes sense here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| You know, it's going to be obviously cost determinative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| on where the development gets, how it gets plotted, how it gets laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| But, yeah, obviously during the development plan discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| we'll engage and keep the conversations open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| I'm not exactly sure where Mr. Maroney's property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| in relation to how this would be laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| but obviously we'll take into consideration those neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| and creating suitable buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| Commissioner... Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| I just came up with one question for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| Planning voted 12-1 to move this to one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| I was not in attendance at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| Can you, based on your recollection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| explain why the planning commission went for one dwelling unit per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6085)|
| 1:41:36| I don't remember the exact conversation, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| but I do know there was references to some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| that have been brought up this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| related to roadway infrastructure, the rural nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| a lot of things that have been outlined in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| Commissioner or Director Brooks, if this fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6117)|
| 1:42:08| then existing zoning applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6128)|
| 1:42:15| Correct. If you all were to deny the request altogether, it would be RV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| It would be RV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| It would rain, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| And that is a big part of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| because that is absolutely not what these people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6147)|
| 1:42:34| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Like I say, I look at the land. I don't look at the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| I look at the land, and RV is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| I'm going to make a motion that to approve PR up to two units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6166)|
| 1:43:00| with a non-vegetation barrier zone on the north side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6180)|
| 1:43:13| Is that right, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| Pull up the map right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| With a non-vegetative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Non-vegetative removal buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| They cannot, in other words, that 35 feet setback or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| they cannot, you cannot disturb that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| So if I could just clarify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| you want a 35-foot vegetated buffer to remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| Non-vegetative buffer removal zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| You want to keep the vegetation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| I want to keep the vegetation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| Undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Undisturbed. Undisturbed zone there of at least 35 feet on that property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| Along the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Along this side, which would be north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6236)|
| 1:44:07| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Is this true north looking at this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Well, that's hard to see on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| Well, it looks like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| It's the site closest to Highland View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| Site closest to Highland View, which should be north because east, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| east, it should be north, the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| Steve, does that make sense to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| Yes, Commissioner, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| There does look like a portion where it's just field now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| and there's no vegetation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Are you requesting they add vegetation in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| I would request that there would be a buffer zone there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| some type of vegetated buffer, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| We can take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| To be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| Would you like to specify what that is or just that it's to not remove the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| existing vegetation and then to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| A type, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Type A is the densest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Yeah, type B buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Type B is not, it's continuous, but it's not the densest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Which I think they would probably have done anyway because of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| to block the views and everything, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| So that's, Madam Chair, you want to read it back and see if I. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6322)|
| 1:45:32| To approve up to two per acre with a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6332)|
| 1:45:40| PR of the two in acre with the vegetation zone on the northern side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| 35 feet, keeping the vegetation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| but adding a B vegetation to what is currently level land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| We have a motion on the floor by Daly, a second by Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6360)|
| 1:46:07| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| Let the record reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240617-zoning?start=6380)|
