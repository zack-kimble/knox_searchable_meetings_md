| 0:02:51| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| residential zone up to five dwelling units per acre for the portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| partial zone A agricultural to make it consistent with the rest of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding area by a vote of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| nine to zero. Thank you, Mr. Blackman. Do you have anything you'd like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| about your project? Sorry, I have to speak up just a little bit. We just wish to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| the approval for five dwelling units per acre. All right, all right. Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=198)|
| 0:03:27| questions about this project? Seeing no lights, Commissioner Lee. Thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=207)|
| 0:03:38| Chair. If you could just explain a little bit about what exactly you're wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| do with this property. We are wanting to put a duplex on the property and we own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=222)|
| 0:03:50| the adjoining property and so we purchased this parcel to add to it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| add a duplex to it. Okay, thank you. Commissioner Frazier. Thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=235)|
| 0:04:04| Chair. I had a question for Director Brooks. I noticed the staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| denial because it's not consistent with the development in the area of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| sector plan. Could you speak to that please, ma'am? Certainly. Planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| recommended denial of the medium-density residential planning district because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| that there wasn't conditions that warranted amendment to the plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| that there wasn't a error or omission, and that the land use classification does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=272)|
| 0:04:40| allow up to five dwellings per acre. Mr. Schoonmaker. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=280)|
| 0:04:50| Applicant, can you pull your microphone a little bit forward because I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| question. Okay, you're saying you want to put a duplex on the 2.27 acres? Two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| Okay, but you're asking for actually that you could put 11 dwelling units on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| property. This piece of property will be combined with 4904 East Emory Road. I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| but if the 2.27 acres is approved at five dwelling units an acre, what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| means is then this body is giving you permission to put 11 dwelling units on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| that 2.27 acres, and so if you don't need that many units, why don't you request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=326)|
| 0:05:35| exactly what you need from this body? We are putting 11 units on it if this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| approved. So it's going to be more than just a one duplex? Yes. So how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| many duplexes will it be? There is currently that have been approved three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| triplexes, and then this parcel with the density would be a duplex, so a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| 11. There's already three on there, I think he's saying. Okay, thank you. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=359)|
| 0:06:10| other questions? Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you have some more questions? We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=370)|
| 0:06:19| zoning just this parcel only, which is 2.27 acres. I know, but we're doing this, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=379)|
| 0:06:28| the other parcels. So we're saying on this parcel, we want to give him 11 dwelling units, correct? If we do it the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=388)|
| 0:06:39| Knox Planning's recommendation is, at 2.27 times 5 dwelling units is 11. Am I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=399)|
| 0:06:53| the only one that's looking at this the wrong way? I see some people shaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| their heads, yes, I don't know, but if you don't need 11 units for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| particular parcel, why are we doing it this way? Mr. Lightman, you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=421)|
| 0:07:10| you're combining it with 4904, is that what you'd said? Yes, 4904 was approved. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| have nine units on that. This 4900 was owned by Turner Homes. We purchased it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| and want to combine it with the other parcel. All right, but the actual zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=444)|
| 0:07:32| you're asking for now is only what is currently shows, which is the 4900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| address, which is the 2.7 acres. Yes. All right. The 4900 is not two acres, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=460)|
| 0:07:50| 0.4, I believe. All combined with the other comes the two acres, which you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| speaking of. All right, so it's the two, it's the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| plats together then, 4900 and 4904. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=481)|
| 0:08:10| Gotcha. It just had a separate address, which sometimes is a little, all right. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| the total of both plats will be 2.7 acres, if I'm understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| correctly. Yes. Ms. Brooks, is that correct? There's two parcels with two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| different addresses, but yet Planning Commission is only recommending the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| address at 4900 East Emory Road? That's correct. It's for parcel ID 029-05701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| Okay. A better way to distinguish it. But he says he's got another parcel that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| it's four-tenths of an acre that he's got approval for nine dwelling units on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Is that correct? No, that's not what he's saying. I'm not following that. That's why I don't get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| math, I can't figure out the math here. That's why this this is not making any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| sense. Sure. Sorry, Commissioner Ward. That's all right. If you look at the packet, it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=537)|
| 0:09:13| little confusing because there's the bigger box. But from what he's saying, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| think I believe the property around the smaller property is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| zoned at five units an acre. He's only coming for the 0.4 acres, that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| unit that's agricultural currently. He wants to change that to match the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| which is five units an acre, so that he can build the 11 in total. So on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| 0.4, he's saying he wants to build a duplex. The duplex will be on just that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| 0.4. The other is already at five units an acre, if you look at your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| zoning maps on the packet. So already he has all the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| basically zoned at five units an acre, except for this one little 0.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| It's a little confusing because they put a big box around everything instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| a little box. But we're not talking about the five units an acre that's already PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| that he owns. We're just talking about that little green corner in that box. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| you look at the zoning map, which I believe is on, which one is this? It's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| the eight down. That's the best map to see. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| sector plan map is right attached to it as well. Is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| Yeah, you're spot on. Hopefully that clears everything up for everybody. So we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| talking about that 0.4, and he already has five units an acre all around it. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| he's only going to build that duplex on that 0.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you, Commissioner Ward, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| Knox Planning, do you agree with what's going on? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| Commissioner Ward described it well. The maps are up on the screen now, so you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| see the green on the top. So it's just that green portion that's carved out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| that black box there. But why would your documents say that that small portion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| 2.27 acres? It is 2.27, that small corner there? Yeah. Because that's what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=666)|
| 0:11:15| requested to be rezoned. And that's 2.27 acres? What's the whole track cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| The plat of record that's been recorded that absorbed that property line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| the small piece, the larger piece, the box that you see there that's dark, is 2.28| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| acres total per the plat recorded a month or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=696)|
| 0:11:46| Okay, thank you. Commissioner Lee. Thank you, Madam Chair. So you're just building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=706)|
| 0:11:56| one duplex? All in all there will be 11. All in all there will be 11. Right now we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=716)|
| 0:12:04| have nine units that have been approved. We bought the other parcel to combine to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| give us a total of 11. Okay, okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Commissioner Frazier. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=730)|
| 0:12:19| Madam Chair. I just want to make sure, I agree where Commissioner Schoonmaker is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| going, we need to make sure that we record it correctly in the record in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| case in the future we need to come back to this that it doesn't state that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=747)|

| 0:35:15| because without the sewer, we can't change the sector plan because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| one of the things that could happen. So they know that they got the cart before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| the horse. They're invested and I would like to see that lot develop myself into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| two lots. Thousand square foot homes, thereabouts, correct? Two thousand square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| foot homes, which is a good family style home. That's a three-bedroom, one-bath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2138)|

| 0:35:50| My seven years, I don't think we've ever done this. So what I would like to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| make a motion, just talking right now, make a motion to approve a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| change and a rezoning change to two per acre upon proof that they have ran sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| to that property from KUV. So if something was to happen and they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| run sewer there, this property will never be rezoned. So I asked the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| director and he said we could do that. It's a conditional zone. Yeah. And he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| asked me, well, why don't we postpone it for 90 days or whatever? None of us would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2192)|
| 0:36:40| spend $42,000 of our own money to come back before this commission and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| get six votes. I wouldn't do it. I don't think anybody sitting here would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| So I'm asking you to help this couple out. They're going to build a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| square foot home, which is a nice home. It will meet the character of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2219)|

| 0:37:15| but that will be the motion I'll be making. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Daly. Commissioner Wheeler. Thank you, Madam Chair. I mean, it definitely makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| sense to me looking at the lot and the other lots beside it. I mean, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| it's kind of like straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel not to change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| sector plan to be able to build two houses there. I do want to know about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| sewer, though, to Commissioner Schoonmaker's point. Which direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Commissioner Daly, would the sewer be coming from? Left, right, or up? I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| think it would, me personally, the shortest route is the right coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Brown Mountain Loop Road. So you're saying sewer is within 142 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| of that lot? So several of those homes are on sewer? Yes. They're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| on it, it just comes down through there? I couldn't say that with certainty one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| way or the other. Okay, do you know? I don't know, but can I answer one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| question? Yeah, sure. Just because the sewer line is running in front of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| property, it's up to John Chapman, KUB, whoever to charge you. They don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| necessarily have to charge you, it's up to them. I'll yield to Commissioner Warsch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| I'll try to explain real quick. So the easiest way, and staff correct me if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| wrong, but if you look at existing land use, you can't up zone unless you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| sewer, correct, in this section? Yes, in the rural area, that's correct. So if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| at the land use map, anything that's been up zoned has to be on sewer. So deductive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| reasoning would say sewer is up to next door, and as Commissioner Daly was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| the lots are a hundred and something feet wide, so it's literally, the pipe is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| a house away. It's probably sitting at the corner of the next lot down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| street, but the lot next door has already been up zoned, so that's telling me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| the lot next to it, to the right, number 29 on this map, already has sewer because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| they've already been up zoned. They couldn't be up zoned unless they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| sewer. So I don't think it would affect neighbors, because to be in that zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| already, they would have to have sewer. So deductive reasoning tells me this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| therefore, I don't think any neighbors would be burdened further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2366)|

| 0:39:59| they would have to have sewer connection. Director Soden, do you have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| information? And obviously, this, I'm looking at KUV's maps, now they may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| you know, obviously, they share these maps with us, so I can't attest to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2413)|

| 0:45:42| I'm going to ask my fellow commissioners to trust me. It will be a viable motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2742)|

| 0:45:53| there, KUB has the letter, go back to Amy, Director Brooks, is that correct? After he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| gets the letter? One more time. After the sewer is ran to the property, he can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2761)|

| 0:46:14| Well, I'm going to defer to Law Director Moyer. It's a conditional zone, so if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| condition is not met, and until the condition is met, the property remains at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| its current zoning. Once the condition is met, then the rezoning becomes effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| that's when you can change the map. And that would be when he goes for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231120-zoning?start=2792)|
