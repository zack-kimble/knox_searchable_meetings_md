| 4:30:15| but go ahead, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16215)|
| 4:30:16| is there anything you want to mention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16216)|
| 4:30:21| On page 8-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16221)|
| 4:30:25| 8-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16225)|
| 4:30:26| Section 8.5.F, it's clarified that the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16226)|
| 4:30:32| Knox County Planning Commission must submit recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16232)|
| 4:30:35| on creation of a historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16235)|
| 4:30:38| as well as the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16238)|
| 4:30:40| and that was just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16240)|
| 4:30:43| So including the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16243)|
| 4:30:45| And that's the current approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16245)|
| 4:30:49| and we just wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16249)|
| 4:30:50| I don't know why the Planning Commission was left out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16250)|
| 4:30:53| It was in one of the previous drafts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16253)|
| 4:30:55| and then we rewrote this for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16255)|
| 4:30:58| So that is the current approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16258)|
| 4:31:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16260)|
| 4:31:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16261)|
| 4:31:02| And the sections 8.5.H on page 8-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16262)|
| 4:31:12| and 8.6.F on page 8-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16272)|
| 4:31:15| the procedure for certificates of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16275)|
| 4:31:18| is clarified and made a bit simpler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16278)|
| 4:31:20| to comply with the current process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16280)|
| 4:31:23| I'm sorry, say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16283)|
| 4:31:24| To be compliant with the current process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16284)|
| 4:31:27| Okay, so on 8-5 under certificates of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16287)|
| 4:31:31| which is H, all that blue is back to the current code language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16291)|
| 4:31:36| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16296)|
| 4:31:37| That's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16297)|
| 4:31:38| And the same on page 8-7, section F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16298)|
| 4:31:41| On 8-7 under F, certificates of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16301)|
| 4:31:45| we've reverted back to current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16305)|
| 4:31:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16307)|
| 4:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16308)|
| 4:31:49| Everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16309)|
| 4:31:50| So it matches what's in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16310)|
| 4:31:53| The old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16313)|
| 4:31:54| The current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16314)|
| 4:31:55| The current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16315)|
| 4:31:56| That's the current one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16316)|
| 4:31:57| Yes, what you see in red matches our current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16317)|
| 4:31:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16319)|
| 4:32:00| What's in blue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16320)|
| 4:32:02| The blue line matches current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16322)|
| 4:32:03| Blue on ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16323)|
| 4:32:04| Blue on our hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16324)|
| 4:32:07| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16327)|
| 4:32:08| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16328)|
| 4:32:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16329)|
| 4:32:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16332)|
| 4:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16333)|
| 4:32:14| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16334)|
| 4:32:15| On page 8.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16335)|
| 4:32:18| 8.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16338)|
| 4:32:19| The provision for 8-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16339)|
| 4:32:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16343)|
| 4:32:26| At this time, I'm usually reading my book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16346)|
| 4:32:29| which is a lot more interesting than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16349)|
| 4:32:33| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16353)|
| 4:32:34| That hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16354)|
| 4:32:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16355)|
| 4:32:36| You just hurt us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16356)|
| 4:32:39| But the company here is so grand that it pays up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16359)|
| 4:32:44| It's a good recovery, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16364)|
| 4:32:46| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16366)|
| 4:32:47| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16367)|
| 4:32:48| On 8.7a, the time period for neighborhoods to be applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16368)|
| 4:33:00| or eligible for the infill housing overlay is stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16380)|
| 4:33:03| as more than 50 years ago rather than prior to 1950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16383)|
| 4:33:06| And this was discussed initially by the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16386)|
| 4:33:10| One of the stakeholder committee members brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16390)|
| 4:33:13| It was discussed by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16393)|
| 4:33:15| and finally got into the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16395)|
| 4:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16398)|
| 4:33:19| To make more neighborhoods eligible for the infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16399)|
| 4:33:22| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16402)|
| 4:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16403)|
| 4:33:24| Final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16404)|
| 4:33:25| This is an item that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16405)|
| 4:33:27| One of the more discussed was the hillside protection overlay on page 8.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16407)|
| 4:33:33| The major change here in Section 8.9a is the 8.9b, rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16413)|
| 4:33:41| is the applicability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16421)|
| 4:33:43| It would apply to residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16423)|
| 4:33:45| There was a lot of concern about the hillside overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16425)|
| 4:33:48| How it would be applied to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16428)|
| 4:33:50| we were not sure how it would apply since it addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16430)|
| 4:33:54| to the largest extent density of residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16434)|
| 4:33:58| And would that be appropriate in our mixed-use districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16438)|
| 4:34:02| And it was also, there were some changes made in the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16442)|
| 4:34:07| to bring it into compliance with the vesting statutes at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16447)|
| 4:34:13| so that we did not conflict with the vesting statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16453)|
| 4:34:16| and the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16456)|
| 4:34:25| Are there comments about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16465)|
| 4:34:32| Were there discussions about the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16472)|
| 4:34:35| applying to downtown as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16475)|
| 4:34:38| There were discussions and there were comments of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16478)|
| 4:34:43| of how we would apply the hillside protection to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16483)|
| 4:34:46| what impact it would have on development downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16486)|
| 4:34:50| would the overall cost be worth the benefits that would be applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16490)|
| 4:34:59| And so the direction was not to apply to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16499)|
| 4:35:05| It would apply to residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16505)|
| 4:35:09| in residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16509)|
| 4:35:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16512)|
| 4:35:17| Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16517)|
| 4:35:21| Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16521)|
| 4:35:24| I want to talk about the hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16524)|
| 4:35:28| This section has changed five times in each draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16528)|
| 4:35:33| It wasn't in there at all in the first draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16533)|
| 4:35:36| Then it was in there and then it was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16536)|
| 4:35:39| from applying to all properties to just residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16539)|
| 4:35:42| and then changed language and now here we are in draft five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16542)|
| 4:35:46| and it's changed again to only apply to residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16546)|
| 4:35:50| So what are you recommending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16550)|
| 4:35:52| I'm recommending that it apply to all properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16552)|
| 4:35:55| And I think that's consistent with what City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16555)|
| 4:35:59| had in mind whatever year ago it was, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16559)|
| 4:36:03| that it should apply to all properties in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16563)|
| 4:36:06| And I don't understand, it keeps changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16566)|
| 4:36:09| because I think some interests don't want to have to deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16569)|
| 4:36:14| and I think that's just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16574)|
| 4:36:16| So it's changed back and forth and back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16576)|
| 4:36:19| and here we are at draft five, it's changed one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16579)|
| 4:36:22| That's that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16582)|
| 4:36:24| The second part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16584)|
| 4:36:25| That's why we're having this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16585)|
| 4:36:28| And we'll have it discussed here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16588)|
| 4:36:30| So it's one of these policy decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16590)|
| 4:36:32| that are up to City Council to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16592)|
| 4:36:34| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16594)|
| 4:36:35| So that's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16595)|
| 4:36:36| Okay, so make your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16596)|
| 4:36:37| So I'm making my case, that's what I've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16597)|
| 4:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16599)|
| 4:36:40| Now the second part has to do with B, 8.9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16600)|
| 4:36:48| also on page 8-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16608)|
| 4:36:51| And that language in B1 and 2 has also changed several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16611)|
| 4:36:59| and it appears to me that the exemption will cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16619)|
| 4:37:10| almost no protection to a lot of residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16630)|
| 4:37:13| that it was supposed to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16633)|
| 4:37:15| And I think it's just basically a big loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16635)|
| 4:37:20| Exemption one removes structures existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16640)|
| 4:37:26| as of the existing date of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16646)|
| 4:37:29| And so lots of, and number two is lots of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16649)|
| 4:37:36| for single family dwellings existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16656)|
| 4:37:38| as of the effective date of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16658)|
| 4:37:40| So under exemption two, it appears that undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16660)|
| 4:37:44| properties of any size presently zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16664)|
| 4:37:47| to allow the construction of single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16667)|
| 4:37:50| would be exempt from hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16670)|
| 4:37:53| So if you had a big piece of property with a hillside on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16673)|
| 4:37:57| say it was a five acre lot and it was zoned for property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16677)|
| 4:38:03| it could be then, the hill could be basically leveled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16683)|
| 4:38:06| removed, you know, and after it's leveled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16686)|
| 4:38:11| then it could be subdivided into more lots, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16691)|
| 4:38:14| into houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16694)|
| 4:38:15| So it just looks like it's a huge loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16695)|
| 4:38:17| when we were trying to protect these hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16697)|
| 4:38:20| in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16700)|
| 4:38:22| So again, this language has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16702)|
| 4:38:24| and when we first raised about this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16704)|
| 4:38:26| they were told, no, no, that's not what we intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16706)|
| 4:38:29| And we said, well, it sure looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16709)|
| 4:38:32| that's the effect it's going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16712)|
| 4:38:34| So we just think that needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16714)|
| 4:38:38| But like you said, there are different opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16718)|
| 4:38:41| and that's why it's here before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16721)|
| 4:38:43| because ultimately they will decide on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16723)|
| 4:38:45| I'm just trying to make, I may not have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16725)|
| 4:38:47| a very good job of explaining it, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16727)|
| 4:38:51| it predates a lot of current members of city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16731)|
| 4:38:55| but I was part of all those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16735)|
| 4:38:57| where we really struggled in the city versus the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16737)|
| 4:39:00| as to how hillside protection would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16740)|
| 4:39:03| And now that we are trying to get it into the recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16743)|
| 4:39:07| to deal with it, there's interests that are trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16747)|
| 4:39:10| to make it not apply where we think it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16750)|
| 4:39:13| So thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16753)|
| 4:39:15| Thank you for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16755)|
| 4:39:16| If I could clarify, this is one of the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16756)|
| 4:39:19| I've always said that adopting policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16759)|
| 4:39:22| those who only work as planners in comprehensive planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16762)|
| 4:39:25| long-range planning, always have a smile on their face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16765)|
| 4:39:28| because they don't have to deal with putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16768)|
| 4:39:30| those policies into ordinance format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16770)|
| 4:39:33| And the exemptions for single-family lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16773)|
| 4:39:37| for existing structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16777)|
| 4:39:39| and for properties having a grading permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16779)|
| 4:39:42| that's one consistent part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16782)|
| 4:39:44| That's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16784)|
| 4:39:45| That's the consistent part of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16785)|
| 4:39:47| of the hillside protection policy or overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16787)|
| 4:39:52| Those exemptions were in from the time we first instituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16792)|
| 4:39:57| or incorporated these standards into the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16797)|
| 4:40:01| of hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16801)|
| 4:40:03| With lots of record for a single-family dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16803)|
| 4:40:09| that would be a single, single-family dwelling on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16809)|
| 4:40:13| We are not going to tell someone who's in a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16813)|
| 4:40:16| that suddenly your lot is not large enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16816)|
| 4:40:19| with your home development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16819)|
| 4:40:21| You exceed the density standards for your subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16821)|
| 4:40:25| My reading of the hillside protection ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16825)|
| 4:40:28| was that it was always to apply to new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16828)|
| 4:40:31| subdivisions, and this would apply in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16831)|
| 4:40:34| that Mr. Silverstein addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16834)|
| 4:40:37| that if a property is subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16837)|
| 4:40:40| we would look at it, apply the hillside protection overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16840)|
| 4:40:43| the density limitations, and reduce the density on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16843)|
| 4:40:47| We're trying to implement the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16847)|
| 4:40:50| that was adopted by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16850)|
| 4:40:52| in a way that meets the intent of that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16852)|
| 4:40:55| and does not adversely impact the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16855)|
| 4:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16859)|
| 4:41:00| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16860)|
| 4:41:01| Can you just help me understand the lots of record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16861)|
| 4:41:04| I know what a lot of record is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16864)|
| 4:41:06| I have lots of record in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16866)|
| 4:41:08| but in terms of being exempt from hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16868)|
| 4:41:14| I'm thinking any examples I can think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16874)|
| 4:41:18| are probably not in the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16878)|
| 4:41:20| but let me see if I can come up with a hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16880)|
| 4:41:23| If, unless you think you can explain it to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16883)|
| 4:41:27| going into the market crash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16887)|
| 4:41:31| there were probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16891)|
| 4:41:32| I think there were some areas off Washington, Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16892)|
| 4:41:34| or Valley View that had some subdivided areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16894)|
| 4:41:37| There were already lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16897)|
| 4:41:39| and maybe individual developers owned them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16899)|
| 4:41:42| or individual people did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16902)|
| 4:41:44| Are you saying that today they weren't developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16904)|
| 4:41:48| there are already lots of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16908)|
| 4:41:50| and somebody came along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16910)|
| 4:41:51| they've already been subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16911)|
| 4:41:53| that they don't, this doesn't apply to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16913)|
| 4:41:57| That's correct, because the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16917)|
| 4:41:59| Because they wouldn't meet the minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16919)|
| 4:42:01| One of the key elements of the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16921)|
| 4:42:03| is reducing density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16923)|
| 4:42:05| so those lots are already created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16925)|
| 4:42:07| so we can't go back and say this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16927)|
| 4:42:11| this area was approved with 15 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16931)|
| 4:42:16| based on the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16936)|
| 4:42:18| You're only allowed 12 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16938)|
| 4:42:21| You have to resubdivide, replant this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16941)|
| 4:42:26| come back and get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16946)|
| 4:42:27| It's already been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16947)|
| 4:42:29| so I'm not, and I turn to our legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16949)|
| 4:42:32| how can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16952)|
| 4:42:35| Can we do that and not be in violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16955)|
| 4:42:38| of the vesting rights or other rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16958)|
| 4:42:40| that are applied to an approved development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16960)|
| 4:42:43| As we've applied and tried to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16963)|
| 4:42:46| the hillside protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16966)|
| 4:42:51| and use on review and rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16971)|
| 4:42:54| we do it as a property that's being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16974)|
| 4:42:57| or subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16977)|
| 4:42:58| not properties that have already been subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16978)|
| 4:43:00| so we're taking that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16980)|
| 4:43:01| trying to incorporate that practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16981)|
| 4:43:05| and make it part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16985)|
| 4:43:07| So if I bought Sharps Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16987)|
| 4:43:11| and it weren't a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16991)|
| 4:43:12| please, I'm not trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16992)|
| 4:43:14| I'm just saying a hill like, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16994)|
| 4:43:16| and it's one giant multi-acre parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16996)|
| 4:43:19| and I come down to MPC and I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16999)|
| 4:43:22| Mr. Brachko, I assume if he's still doing the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17002)|
| 4:43:25| I'd like to subdivide this giant wooded area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17005)|
| 4:43:28| hillside that I just bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17008)|
| 4:43:31| Then you would be subject to the hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17011)|
| 4:43:33| we'd check the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17013)|
| 4:43:34| we'd check the grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17014)|
| 4:43:35| but if you bought a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17015)|
| 4:43:38| and Sharps Ridge had already been subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17018)|
| 4:43:42| If I went up Hanover or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17022)|
| 4:43:44| that Hancock Street that goes up into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17024)|
| 4:43:47| and there were an existing lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17027)|
| 4:43:48| And you bought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17028)|
| 4:43:49| then the hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17029)|
| 4:43:51| would not apply to your lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17031)|
| 4:43:55| If I can speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17035)|
| 4:43:56| maybe I don't understand what a lot of record is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17036)|
| 4:43:58| but across the street from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17038)|
| 4:43:59| there's a 12-acre lot and it's a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17039)|
| 4:44:02| As I read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17042)|
| 4:44:05| every piece of property is some kind of lot of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17045)|
| 4:44:09| Maybe a big lot of 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17049)|
| 4:44:11| maybe a small lot of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17051)|
| 4:44:14| But if there's a 12-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17054)|
| 4:44:17| it is a lot of record, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17057)|
| 4:44:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17060)|
| 4:44:21| If it's a hillside with an H hillside overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17061)|
| 4:44:26| I can level it and then go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17066)|
| 4:44:28| and get subdivided into smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17068)|
| 4:44:31| That's the loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17071)|
| 4:44:34| Everything's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17074)|
| 4:44:36| I don't know a piece of property in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17076)|
| 4:44:38| that isn't a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17078)|
| 4:44:39| Big, small, hilly, flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17079)|
| 4:44:41| They're all lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17081)|
| 4:44:42| This enables you to buy Sharps Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17082)|
| 4:44:46| if it's one lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17086)|
| 4:44:47| level it and then go in and subdivide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17087)|
| 4:44:50| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17090)|
| 4:44:51| The density, the grading limitations in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17091)|
| 4:44:54| the maximum land disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17094)|
| 4:44:56| let's say that lot where I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17096)|
| 4:45:00| 50 acres and I had to grade up 15 to 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17100)|
| 4:45:04| then the maximum land disturbance is 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17104)|
| 4:45:07| These, the density standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17107)|
| 4:45:09| and the grading standards are not interlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17109)|
| 4:45:12| They're two separate standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17112)|
| 4:45:14| You have a density limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17114)|
| 4:45:16| and a grading land disturbance limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17116)|
| 4:45:18| So that, I think that's maybe a clarification we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17118)|
| 4:45:23| in this that the grading standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17123)|
| 4:45:26| and the density standards are not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17126)|
| 4:45:30| So when you say grading standards and density standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17130)|
| 4:45:33| you're talking about Part C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17133)|
| 4:45:35| density and land disturbance limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17135)|
| 4:45:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17137)|
| 4:45:38| Isn't that the hillside protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17138)|
| 4:45:40| That is the hillside protection, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17140)|
| 4:45:42| So what does 2B2 stand for, protect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17142)|
| 4:45:47| B2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17147)|
| 4:45:48| If a 12-acre lot...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17148)|
| 4:45:50| If you have a 12-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17150)|
| 4:45:51| you can build a single-family home on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17151)|
| 4:45:53| but your grading limitation is still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17153)|
| 4:45:56| So the lot of record is not an exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17156)|
| 4:45:59| to the hillside protection, only if it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17159)|
| 4:46:03| If it's a single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17163)|
| 4:46:05| Lots of record for single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17165)|
| 4:46:08| So lots of record developed as a single-family, not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17168)|
| 4:46:14| Okay, lots of record developed as a single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17174)|
| 4:46:18| not lots of record for a single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17178)|
| 4:46:22| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17182)|
| 4:46:23| it's only when you're developing a single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17183)|
| 4:46:26| I guess in my neighborhood, all the lot...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17186)|
| 4:46:29| Maybe that's not a good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17189)|
| 4:46:31| but my entire neighborhood was platted out in the 1800s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17191)|
| 4:46:36| Were those developed as lots of records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17196)|
| 4:46:38| only for single-family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17198)|
| 4:46:40| I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17200)|
| 4:46:41| I'm trying to make sure we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17201)|
| 4:46:43| The language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17203)|
| 4:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17204)|
| 4:46:45| That's where the hang-up is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17205)|
| 4:46:47| I don't know how to make sense of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17207)|
| 4:46:50| Developed as...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17210)|
| 4:46:51| I think developed as instead of for would make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17211)|
| 4:46:56| What about if you discuss them as some sort...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17216)|
| 4:46:58| It's almost like they're grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17218)|
| 4:47:00| because they've come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17220)|
| 4:47:02| they were subdivided at a particular time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17222)|
| 4:47:05| with a particular standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17225)|
| 4:47:07| and then the standard changed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17227)|
| 4:47:10| Is that some way to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17230)|
| 4:47:12| And that's what we're trying to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17232)|
| 4:47:14| I think we were trying to get at with these provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17234)|
| 4:47:17| that grandfathering, investing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17237)|
| 4:47:19| that we're not running into any conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17239)|
| 4:47:22| with those provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17242)|
| 4:47:24| And I can actually think of legitimate examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17244)|
| 4:47:27| like behind...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17247)|
| 4:47:28| Off of Woodland, Sheppard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17248)|
| 4:47:31| which is a little street between McMillan and Cornelia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17251)|
| 4:47:35| It's a pretty decent grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17255)|
| 4:47:38| and there might be one undeveloped small lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17258)|
| 4:47:41| of record there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17261)|
| 4:47:42| There is, at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17262)|
| 4:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17263)|
| 4:47:44| And so your intent is to not limit those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17264)|
| 4:47:49| from being developable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17269)|
| 4:47:51| which I'm good with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17271)|
| 4:47:54| but I agree with Ms. Malone's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17274)|
| 4:47:56| I'm not sure that we've...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17276)|
| 4:47:58| that the 12-acre lots and the 2-acre lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17278)|
| 4:48:01| and the 5-acre lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17281)|
| 4:48:02| those are lots of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17282)|
| 4:48:04| Well, we can work on the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17284)|
| 4:48:05| and have something for you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17285)|
| 4:48:07| I don't think using the phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17287)|
| 4:48:09| lots of records exempted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17289)|
| 4:48:11| is hitting the middle of the target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17291)|
| 4:48:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17295)|
| 4:48:17| Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17297)|
| 4:48:18| Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17298)|
| 4:48:19| Brandon Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17299)|
| 4:48:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17300)|
| 4:48:21| I would just point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17301)|
| 4:48:22| that if it was a 12-acre lot...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17302)|
| 4:48:23| Please state your address for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17303)|
| 4:48:25| Brandon Clark, 609 Wise Carver Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17305)|
| 4:48:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17307)|
| 4:48:28| I would point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17308)|
| 4:48:29| if that 12-acre lot was going to be subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17309)|
| 4:48:31| then it would be subject to the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17311)|
| 4:48:34| So if it was a lot of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17314)|
| 4:48:36| in a developed subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17316)|
| 4:48:38| where someone bought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17318)|
| 4:48:39| with the intent of putting a house on it one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17319)|
| 4:48:41| it would be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17321)|
| 4:48:42| But in the case of a 12-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17322)|
| 4:48:44| even if it had a home on it, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17324)|
| 4:48:46| if someone was going to come back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17326)|
| 4:48:48| and subdivide that into a new subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17328)|
| 4:48:50| that would not fall under that lot of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17330)|
| 4:48:52| That would be proposing new lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17332)|
| 4:48:54| which would be subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17334)|
| 4:48:55| to the hillside protection, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17335)|
| 4:48:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17336)|
| 4:48:57| But I think you could get a grading permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17337)|
| 4:49:00| prior to subdividing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17340)|
| 4:49:02| And my concern...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17342)|
| 4:49:04| And look, if it's exempt here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17344)|
| 4:49:07| if you look at applicability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17347)|
| 4:49:09| that's what B is, applicability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17349)|
| 4:49:12| How does this apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17352)|
| 4:49:14| How does C apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17354)|
| 4:49:16| if it's been exempted in B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17356)|
| 4:49:18| under applicability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17358)|
| 4:49:19| You have to read the red words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17359)|

| 4:49:22| You have to read the red words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17362)|
| 4:49:23| that were crossed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17363)|
| 4:49:24| says Nick Dellivopy from the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17364)|
| 4:49:27| They wanted to keep it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17367)|
| 4:49:29| but now they've taken that out too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17369)|
| 4:49:31| I'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17371)|
| 4:49:32| Okay, but be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17372)|
| 4:49:34| Yeah, Nick Dellivopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17374)|
| 4:49:36| It's 824,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17376)|
| 4:49:37| and I want everyone to be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17377)|
| 4:49:40| We all love one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17380)|
| 4:49:41| We're all trying hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17381)|
| 4:49:42| We love one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17382)|
| 4:49:43| even in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17383)|
| 4:49:45| I live through many months...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17385)|
| 4:49:46| But we can all be home reading our book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17386)|
| 4:49:48| drinking a glass of wine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17388)|
| 4:49:50| so we're here together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17390)|
| 4:49:51| so we're going to be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17391)|
| 4:49:53| I live through many months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17393)|
| 4:49:54| of many meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17394)|
| 4:49:55| about hillside and ridgetown protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17395)|
| 4:49:58| and my concern is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17398)|
| 4:50:00| why are we restricting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17400)|
| 4:50:02| only to residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17402)|
| 4:50:04| The concerns that were talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17404)|
| 4:50:06| that led up to this were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17406)|
| 4:50:08| if we clear steep land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17408)|
| 4:50:10| we'll have erosion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17410)|
| 4:50:12| we'll have pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17412)|
| 4:50:13| we'll have flooding below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17413)|
| 4:50:15| we'll have fire trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17415)|
| 4:50:16| that can't make it up the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17416)|
| 4:50:18| and service it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17418)|
| 4:50:19| There were a lot of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17419)|
| 4:50:20| that were both social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17420)|
| 4:50:22| and governmental concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17422)|
| 4:50:23| and we even had provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17423)|
| 4:50:25| that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17425)|
| 4:50:26| if you'll work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17426)|
| 4:50:28| we'll find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17428)|
| 4:50:29| to let you develop more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17429)|
| 4:50:31| in a pocket of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17431)|
| 4:50:33| and then leave part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17433)|
| 4:50:35| bare or undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17435)|
| 4:50:37| Now we're taking out industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17437)|
| 4:50:39| we're taking out office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17439)|
| 4:50:40| we're taking out other features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17440)|
| 4:50:42| and the same ecological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17442)|
| 4:50:45| and aesthetic requirements apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17445)|
| 4:50:49| That seems like a subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17449)|
| 4:50:51| of a separate council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17451)|
| 4:50:53| not a code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17453)|
| 4:50:55| that was just going to move in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17455)|
| 4:50:56| the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17456)|
| 4:50:58| The chamber hired Attorney Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17458)|
| 4:51:01| who spent hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17461)|
| 4:51:02| and many of their dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17462)|
| 4:51:03| trying to get out of this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17463)|
| 4:51:05| but at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17465)|
| 4:51:06| the city council adopted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17466)|
| 4:51:08| as the policy of this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17468)|
| 4:51:10| and we shouldn't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17470)|
| 4:51:11| throw it out the window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17471)|
| 4:51:12| because it's a convenient time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17472)|
| 4:51:13| to cross through a few names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17473)|
| 4:51:15| and letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17475)|
| 4:51:16| I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17476)|
| 4:51:17| to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17477)|
| 4:51:18| or take it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17478)|
| 4:51:19| as a separate subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17479)|
| 4:51:20| this council wants to renew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17480)|
| 4:51:22| and change the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17482)|
| 4:51:24| looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17484)|
| 4:51:25| But that's a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17485)|
| 4:51:26| major change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17486)|
| 4:51:27| Right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17487)|
| 4:51:28| So I do want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17488)|
| 4:51:29| that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17489)|
| 4:51:30| because I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17490)|
| 4:51:31| the same question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17491)|
| 4:51:32| in my own mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17492)|
| 4:51:33| Why is it only residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17493)|
| 4:51:35| The original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17495)|
| 4:51:36| the plan that exists now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17496)|
| 4:51:39| that's not incorporate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17499)|
| 4:51:42| that we now want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17502)|
| 4:51:43| to incorporate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17503)|
| 4:51:44| what does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17504)|
| 4:51:46| The plan states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17506)|
| 4:51:48| it would apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17508)|
| 4:51:49| to all properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17509)|
| 4:51:51| Okay, so I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17511)|
| 4:51:52| you've talked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17512)|
| 4:51:53| a lot of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17513)|
| 4:51:54| and there's been a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17514)|
| 4:51:55| of different folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17515)|
| 4:51:56| that have opinions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17516)|
| 4:51:57| I'll let one of them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17517)|
| 4:51:58| Okay, one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17518)|
| 4:51:59| will speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17519)|
| 4:52:00| Ms. Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17520)|
| 4:52:01| Again, it's trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17521)|
| 4:52:02| to balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17522)|
| 4:52:03| the different opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17523)|
| 4:52:05| and not adversely impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17525)|
| 4:52:08| the economic well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17528)|
| 4:52:10| of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17530)|
| 4:52:11| but to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17531)|
| 4:52:12| the safety, health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17532)|
| 4:52:13| and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17533)|
| 4:52:14| of the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17534)|

| 4:52:18| Gerald, it's applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17538)|
| 4:52:20| to all but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17540)|
| 4:52:21| when is it applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17541)|
| 4:52:22| The only time it's applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17542)|
| 4:52:24| is when we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17544)|
| 4:52:25| and it's not very often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17545)|
| 4:52:27| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17547)|
| 4:52:28| It's when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17548)|
| 4:52:29| a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17549)|
| 4:52:30| or use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17550)|
| 4:52:31| and primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17551)|
| 4:52:32| it's applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17552)|
| 4:52:33| on residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17553)|
| 4:52:35| I'm trying to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17555)|
| 4:52:36| of a non-residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17556)|
| 4:52:37| development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17557)|
| 4:52:38| in the four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17558)|
| 4:52:39| I've been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17559)|
| 4:52:40| that it's in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17560)|
| 4:52:41| that it's been applied to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17561)|
| 4:52:42| and I can't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17562)|
| 4:52:43| of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17563)|
| 4:52:44| But the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17564)|
| 4:52:45| are there other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17565)|
| 4:52:48| that could be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17568)|
| 4:52:51| They may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17571)|
| 4:52:52| have applied yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17572)|
| 4:52:53| but are there other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17573)|
| 4:52:54| Are non-residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17574)|
| 4:52:56| vacant non-residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17576)|
| 4:52:57| properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17577)|
| 4:52:58| that fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17578)|
| 4:52:59| under the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17579)|
| 4:53:00| overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17580)|
| 4:53:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17581)|
| 4:53:02| And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=17582)|

| 5:16:30| to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=18990)|
| 5:16:31| at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=18991)|
| 5:16:32| least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=18992)|
| 5:16:33| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=18993)|
| 5:16:34| will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=18994)|
| 5:16:35| 916, page 916. Part U, microbrewery, distillery, winery, where we all want to be now. Part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=18995)|
| 5:16:46| A, section 12.9 is actually talking about trees, but buffer is section 12.8. 12.8, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19006)|
| 5:16:55| number 8, 12.8. And that will repeat itself. We'll next turn to page 9-18, please. Part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19015)|
| 5:17:05| AA, number 6. Again, it references 12.9. It should be 12.8. That's the buffer yard section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19025)|
| 5:17:15| Okay, hold on. If you look on page 9-16. 9-18. Which page are you on? Just change all 12.9s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19035)|
| 5:17:26| to 12.8s. Okay. Hold on, AA-6. It says section 6 or 6. Are those the only two? No, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19046)|
| 5:17:46| a few more. Okay, keep going. Okay, and on page 9-19, under CC, storage yard, it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19066)|
| 5:17:54| same. It should be 12.8, as well as DD, part 3, 12.8. Did you find this yourself? He used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19074)|
| 5:18:08| the control app. Very good. I'm impressed. Okay, it's another one not dealing with buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19088)|
| 5:18:19| yards, though. Page 9-25, literally the very last line. It says 16.11. It should be 16.12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19099)|
| 5:18:29| I think. That's why he's a lawyer. That's why he's a lawyer. And I think if, turn to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19109)|
| 5:18:47| page 9-26, please. Part 8 at the top. In addition to the required application information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19127)|
| 5:18:57| the application must include the following, and it's a period. It seems like there should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19137)|
| 5:19:03| be a colon there with a list of what should be included. I'm guessing that was in an earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19143)|
| 5:19:09| section, maybe, or there's a better way to explain that I'm missing. Well, yeah, in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19149)|
| 5:19:18| to that. Yeah, that's not supposed to be a colon. There's another problem with the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19158)|
| 5:19:24| right? Yeah. I think, I'm trying to remember, in an earlier draft, there were some requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19164)|
| 5:19:30| after that, and now the general requirements are just listed. So I think that first sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19170)|
| 5:19:38| could be stricken and not. Well, or perhaps reversing the order of those two sentences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19178)|
| 5:19:44| and putting a colon right after following. That may work, yeah. That'd probably be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19184)|
| 5:19:48| clear. So 9-26H, it would say, under application submittal requirements, it would say an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19188)|
| 5:19:57| must be filed with the planning commission and look at planning commissions listed twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19197)|
| 5:20:03| Lots of typos here. On forms provided for that purpose, period, in addition to the required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19203)|
| 5:20:10| application information, the application must include the following colon, and then it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19210)|
| 5:20:16| the general requirements. And on down, is that right? Is that what this is supposed to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19216)|
| 5:20:24| No? Okay, how about we ask them to review page 9-26 on this one, okay? And figure out, there's several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19224)|
| 5:20:36| typos, and we need to figure out what we're trying to say there. Yeah, we need clarity here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19236)|
| 5:20:43| So any objection from council that we just pass this to staff or me? Do you want a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19243)|
| 5:20:50| I don't think we need a motion for that, because we're just asking them to come back with adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19250)|
| 5:20:55| on page 9-26. We'll go back on the other ones, though. Any more on those that you've seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19255)|
| 5:21:09| Well, 9-32. 9-what? 32, Mayor. At the very top, I think it says may be used for temporary outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19269)|
| 5:21:25| Sales. And then maybe a period. Yeah, and the word sales should be inserted in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19285)|
| 5:21:36| I was just reading temporary outdoor, then the word permanent. Yeah, but it should be sales period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19296)|
| 5:21:42| Outdoor sales period, and then new sentence, permanent display structures. Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19302)|
| 5:21:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19311)|
| 5:22:02| Okay, so is that something we can just make a motion on all those changes for section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19322)|
| 5:22:09| To adjust the section? Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19329)|
| 5:22:12| Well, I have another additional update very quickly, if I can direct you back to page 9-7 under 9.3, section A, animal care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19332)|
| 5:22:23| Wait, wait, wait. 9-7. Okay. 9-7. Okay. So under animal care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19343)|
| 5:22:30| A1 says, actually says such facilities may only board four or more dogs or cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19350)|
| 5:22:37| In section 2, under animal breeder, we actually have five or more animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19357)|
| 5:22:42| We also have five or more animals defined for kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19362)|
| 5:22:46| So I think that we would need to change that number to five, from four to five, to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19366)|
| 5:22:53| Okay. That four needs to be five or more dogs. So that's page 9-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19373)|
| 5:22:59| Is that the chapter 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19379)|
| 5:23:07| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19387)|
| 5:23:17| Yes, so if we have one motion to change all the incorrect section numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19397)|
| 5:23:25| and also the five, can we change the five dogs then? The four to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19405)|
| 5:23:30| Yes. Or do you want a separate motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19410)|
| 5:23:32| Okay, separate motions. The first is to change all the incorrect section numbers from 12.8 as identified by Mr. Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19412)|
| 5:23:42| Hey, Rob, how about there, B5 on page 9.7, there's another section 12.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19422)|
| 5:23:47| Is that supposed to be section 12.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19427)|
| 5:23:52| 9-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19432)|
| 5:23:55| Oh, yeah, it's number 5, B5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19435)|
| 5:23:57| B5, like the playing bingo or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19437)|
| 5:23:59| Good catch, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19439)|
| 5:24:02| Bob, how did you miss that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19442)|
| 5:24:03| He caught one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19443)|
| 5:24:04| Who says we're getting tired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19444)|
| 5:24:06| It should be 12.8. Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19446)|
| 5:24:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19450)|
| 5:24:12| It should be 12.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19452)|
| 5:24:14| So you'll do a search, a find, right, if there's any others that you can point out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19454)|
| 5:24:20| So the motion is anywhere where it says section 12.9, even if there's some we have not yet found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19460)|
| 5:24:31| if it is incorrect and needs to be 12.8, we change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19471)|
| 5:24:35| And there was one other section that wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19475)|
| 5:24:38| What's the other section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19478)|
| 5:24:39| What was the other one, Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19479)|
| 5:24:41| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19481)|
| 5:24:43| Rob, I think you had this one. It was 16.11, changing it to 16.12, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19483)|
| 5:24:48| Yes, that's correct, bottom of page 9-25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19488)|
| 5:24:51| And that one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19491)|
| 5:24:53| Any others like that that are the section numbers that we just went over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19493)|
| 5:24:57| I'm sorry, I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19497)|
| 5:24:59| I'm just wondering if there are any others like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19499)|
| 5:25:01| I think all of them were 12.9 or that one, 16.11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19501)|
| 5:25:06| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19506)|
| 5:25:07| Okay, so I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19507)|
| 5:25:08| Did I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19508)|
| 5:25:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19510)|
| 5:25:11| Okay, so we're going to ask them to go ahead and change all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19511)|
| 5:25:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19514)|
| 5:25:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19515)|
| 5:25:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19516)|
| 5:25:17| Okay, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19517)|
| 5:25:20| Okay, and then what do you want to speak to, sir, just so I know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19520)|
| 5:25:26| We're trying to make some corrections right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19526)|
| 5:25:27| Can you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19527)|
| 5:25:29| Okay, you're not addressing those corrections, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19529)|
| 5:25:32| Okay, let's just finish those before we call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19532)|
| 5:25:38| Okay, 9-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19538)|
| 5:25:40| We're on 9-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19540)|
| 5:25:42| This is Animal Care Facility A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19542)|
| 5:25:45| We want to change four or more dogs to five or more dogs to be consistent with the other regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19545)|
| 5:25:54| Okay, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19554)|
| 5:25:56| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19556)|
| 5:25:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19557)|

| 5:26:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19560)|
| 5:26:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19561)|

| 5:26:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19567)|
| 5:26:17| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19577)|
| 5:26:18| Did you mention, Rob, that I'm going through my, see what I circled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19578)|
| 5:26:25| I have a question for Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19585)|
| 5:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19587)|

| 5:26:32| Have you found that 1,000 feet of an existing alternative financial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19592)|
| 5:26:36| Has that been a good, has that been a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19596)|
| 5:26:39| Yes, it has been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19599)|
| 5:26:41| And this incorporates an ordinance that was adopted three years ago or so by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19601)|
| 5:26:50| And from my observation, it has worked well to allow, still allow some alternative financial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19610)|
| 5:27:01| or protect clustering of them and has helped those neighborhoods who felt that they were being targeted by those types of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19621)|
| 5:27:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19628)|
| 5:27:11| Councilwoman Singprez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19631)|
| 5:27:12| Are we, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19632)|
| 5:27:14| Are we done with the corrections and now we're going through Chapter 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19634)|
| 5:27:17| I think we're, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19637)|
| 5:27:19| So we need to go to the matrix too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19639)|
| 5:27:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19642)|
| 5:27:23| I need to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19643)|
| 5:27:24| I'm very tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19644)|
| 5:27:25| This is getting very blurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19645)|
| 5:27:28| I think this is really important, especially Chapter 9 or Article 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19648)|
| 5:27:33| I'd like to be awake for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19653)|
| 5:27:36| I don't think that there's a rush to finish this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19656)|
| 5:27:38| If we need to come early for the next council meeting, I'm good for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19658)|
| 5:27:43| I'm good for trying to find a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19663)|
| 5:27:45| But this is important, and I'm not fully present to make good decisions, my best decisions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19665)|
| 5:27:52| Let's make a motion we adjourn until May 30th and pick it back up where we are, where we left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19672)|
| 5:27:57| And so that is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19677)|
| 5:28:00| What I'd like, I know it's adding a bit more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19680)|
| 5:28:03| but if we could finish Article 9 since we can go to the use matrix on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19683)|
| 5:28:08| start with the use matrix on May 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19688)|
| 5:28:11| but that would allow us as staff to get through all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19691)|
| 5:28:16| and not try to remember where we were in Article 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19696)|
| 5:28:19| Wait a minute, are you saying you want us to go ahead and do the use matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19699)|
| 5:28:22| No, we'll wait on the use matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19702)|
| 5:28:24| but just finish everything in Article 9 just so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19704)|
| 5:28:27| Yeah, so is there anything, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19707)|
| 5:28:30| If we just consider, is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19710)|
| 5:28:32| The gentleman that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19712)|
| 5:28:34| Yes, sir, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19714)|
| 5:28:35| Come on up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19715)|
| 5:28:36| Is that okay, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19716)|
| 5:28:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19718)|
| 5:28:39| I mean, I think there's some general agreement with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19719)|
| 5:28:41| but we can do finish 9 except for the table, which is we've got, you know, some changes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19721)|
| 5:28:48| but that we will wait on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19728)|
| 5:28:50| Okay, so, sir, please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19730)|
| 5:28:53| Scott Larrick, 1704 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19733)|
| 5:28:56| This is on, this is in reference to page 9-14, item L-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19736)|
| 5:29:05| Let us get there, 9-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19745)|
| 5:29:09| Which is the requirement for a food truck park to provide permanent restroom facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19749)|
| 5:29:15| 9-14 what letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19755)|
| 5:29:18| L-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19758)|
| 5:29:20| Oh, up at the very top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19760)|
| 5:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19761)|
| 5:29:23| And this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19763)|
| 5:29:24| The park's blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19764)|
| 5:29:26| Oh, food truck park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19766)|
| 5:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19767)|
| 5:29:28| The top of 9-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19768)|
| 5:29:30| It starts on page 9-13 and wraps around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19770)|
| 5:29:32| Okay, go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19772)|
| 5:29:34| My wife and I own and operate Central Filling Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19774)|
| 5:29:37| which is currently the only food truck park that exists in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19777)|
| 5:29:42| Just for, like, the ten-second history, we approached the city about two years ago with this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19782)|
| 5:29:46| and sort of had a lengthy process to getting the approvals that we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19786)|
| 5:29:50| because our project didn't fit neatly into the old zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19790)|
| 5:29:55| So we've worked closely with the city for the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19795)|
| 5:29:57| We're very much up to speed on the efforts of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19797)|
| 5:30:00| We wound up getting the project approved under a temporary use permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19800)|
| 5:30:05| which is only renewable for a maximum of three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19805)|
| 5:30:11| When the project was first approved, we met with plans review, zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19811)|
| 5:30:15| MPC, the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19815)|
| 5:30:17| and everyone had agreed at that time that portable restrooms would be adequate for our project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19817)|
| 5:30:23| because we're operating on an undeveloped lot that is essentially open space with no existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19823)|
| 5:30:30| and also because the existing MFU ordinance does not specifically require that restrooms be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19830)|
| 5:30:35| for MFU's food trucks operating on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19835)|
| 5:30:41| So at this point, we've been operating for a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19841)|
| 5:30:45| We check in with the health department regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19845)|
| 5:30:48| They're literally 100 yards from our front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19848)|
| 5:30:51| We've had no sanitation issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19851)|
| 5:30:53| And so what we are asking for is that that word permanent be struck from this line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19853)|
| 5:30:59| We actually agree that restrooms being provided at the food truck park is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19859)|
| 5:31:06| We just would like for the ability for properties like ours or other properties downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19866)|
| 5:31:13| that might be in infill use that are going to operate essentially in open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19873)|
| 5:31:17| that don't have an existing building that they be allowed to utilize portable restrooms for their sanitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19877)|
| 5:31:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19884)|
| 5:31:25| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19885)|
| 5:31:26| That sounds reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19886)|
| 5:31:27| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19887)|
| 5:31:29| Okay, let me just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19889)|
| 5:31:30| This looks like it was added in this version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19890)|
| 5:31:34| Is there reason for that or is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19894)|
| 5:31:36| Let me just see if there's any objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19896)|
| 5:31:41| Yeah, I asked for it to be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19901)|
| 5:31:44| Yeah, we did work with them closely on the front end, and really the intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19904)|
| 5:31:49| the allowance for the portable toilets where they're at was because it was temporary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19909)|
| 5:31:55| knowing that it would not be a permanent thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19915)|
| 5:31:58| I'm not sure the city wants to see Port-a-John's on Gay Street next to the Century Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19918)|
| 5:32:08| Is that what you want to see in your downtown, in your undeveloped lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19928)|
| 5:32:14| And I thought it would be wise to put the provision in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19934)|
| 5:32:19| I'm not married to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19939)|
| 5:32:21| But that was the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19941)|
| 5:32:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19944)|
| 5:32:25| Okay, does the council want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19945)|
| 5:32:27| Well, this is a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19947)|
| 5:32:31| I was there on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19951)|
| 5:32:33| I go there frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19953)|
| 5:32:37| And I understand that it's temporary, and I understand the nature of things not being permanent temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19957)|
| 5:32:42| One of my least favorite things is permanent temporary storage violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19962)|
| 5:32:46| We haven't even gotten to that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19966)|
| 5:32:48| Anyway, another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19968)|
| 5:32:50| You know, in my mind, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19970)|
| 5:32:54| I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19974)|
| 5:32:58| I just so when I think about like it just popped into my head because you mentioned Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19978)|
| 5:33:06| We do allow the market to happen every weekend without restrooms that are permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19986)|
| 5:33:14| For a long time that went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19994)|
| 5:33:16| And then the city built restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19996)|
| 5:33:19| So I know one of the things that I've discussed with the owners of this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=19999)|
| 5:33:25| and I had some conversation with Patricia, is, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20005)|
| 5:33:32| I really have a difficult time with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20012)|
| 5:33:34| If we allow the markets and the food trucks to be set up with access to the public restrooms at Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20014)|
| 5:33:41| but then we aren't considering the idea of, you know, bathroom facilities that might be a reciprocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20021)|
| 5:33:51| I understand the port-a-johns, though those are very clean and well-maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20031)|
| 5:33:58| As a possibility, then we squelch this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20038)|
| 5:34:04| It is temporary because it's not the highest, best use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20044)|
| 5:34:08| So this is where I'm struggling with this because they won't be grandfathered, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20048)|
| 5:34:14| because their temporary permit is going to expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20054)|
| 5:34:17| Yeah, they're on year number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20057)|
| 5:34:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20059)|
| 5:34:20| So here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20060)|
| 5:34:21| When I sat there with them, I said, okay, under the food truck ordinance, brown appliances across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20061)|
| 5:34:29| and there could be two trucks on brown appliances lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20069)|
| 5:34:32| And then restaurant supplies across the street, and there could be two trucks over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20072)|
| 5:34:36| And under the food truck ordinance, there could be some tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20076)|
| 5:34:40| Is that correct with the food truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20080)|
| 5:34:42| Or no, there's no seating, no tables allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20082)|
| 5:34:45| I may be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20085)|
| 5:34:47| I don't have that ordinance in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20087)|
| 5:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20089)|
| 5:34:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20090)|
| 5:34:51| Well, regardless, you could have two food trucks over here and two food trucks over here on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20091)|
| 5:34:55| and people could be running back and forth from Schultz Brow and Elkmont and Central whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20095)|
| 5:35:03| whatever beer place that we should be at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20103)|
| 5:35:06| We could have people and kids running around in all these different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20106)|
| 5:35:10| and the differentiation here is they have, I think, four or five trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20110)|
| 5:35:15| and it's corralled within a fence, and they've provided tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20115)|
| 5:35:18| And because it's within one property and they've provided tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20118)|
| 5:35:22| now they have to provide the permanent restrooms, which in my conversations with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20122)|
| 5:35:29| they did spend a chunk of change on shore power, and so now we're looking at, by my guesstimations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20129)|
| 5:35:35| I would estimate 20-ish thousand or more to put in restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20135)|
| 5:35:39| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20139)|
| 5:35:42| I'm going to have to agree with Ms. Singh-Perez at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20142)|
| 5:35:44| I'm getting tired and I'm rambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20144)|
| 5:35:47| But I'm having a difficult time with striking this and what the limitations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20147)|
| 5:35:55| and then if we strike the word permanent, how far it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20155)|
| 5:35:58| But there are examples in town where we don't require restrooms that are permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20158)|
| 5:36:04| It's a non-building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20164)|
| 5:36:06| That's the other part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20166)|
| 5:36:07| I'll stop rambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20167)|
| 5:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20168)|
| 5:36:09| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20169)|
| 5:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20170)|
| 5:36:11| So I'd like to get a clear definition of a food truck park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20171)|
| 5:36:15| because it actually says here that it's a designated area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20175)|
| 5:36:19| it must be a designated manager of the lot that's responsible for the orderly organization of the food truck vendors, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20179)|
| 5:36:26| So I guess the example was given that would we want to see a bunch of port-a-potties on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20186)|
| 5:36:34| If the definition of a food truck park is such as written on page 9-13L3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20194)|
| 5:36:42| I don't see how that would be possible that we could have a food truck park on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20202)|
| 5:36:48| That was just hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20208)|
| 5:36:49| I wasn't saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20209)|
| 5:36:50| Let's say on Gay Street next to the Century Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20210)|
| 5:36:53| There's right now a vacant lot, and you could definitely create a food truck park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20213)|
| 5:37:02| Do you want to walk by Port-a-John's permanently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20222)|
| 5:37:05| Food truck park is a permanent, it's a primary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20225)|
| 5:37:09| It's not a temporary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20229)|
| 5:37:11| So that's, my thoughts are if it's a primary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20231)|
| 5:37:15| There'll be a bunch of trucks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20235)|
| 5:37:17| I mean, there are trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20237)|
| 5:37:19| So why is it that they would even have to take on the onus of having bathroom facilities at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20239)|
| 5:37:26| If it's a food truck park, I can get my food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20246)|
| 5:37:28| If I choose to sit down and eat, I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20248)|
| 5:37:30| If not, and if I need to use the restroom, I go somewhere else or I go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20250)|
| 5:37:34| I guess I'm just not really seeing how the onus should be on the person who is managing the food truck park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20254)|
| 5:37:41| especially in this case, a person who actually happens to have an established building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20261)|
| 5:37:46| that he would have to take on that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20266)|
| 5:37:48| So I guess I'm struggling a little bit with this, and I, too, am tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20268)|
| 5:37:51| And maybe I'm just not getting it, but I would like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20271)|
| 5:37:54| I'll try to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20274)|
| 5:37:55| And I'm not taking a stand either way on the permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20275)|
| 5:37:59| I think restroom facilities are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20279)|
| 5:38:03| I live five miles from Central Food Truck Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20283)|
| 5:38:06| I go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20286)|
| 5:38:07| I have lunch on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20287)|
| 5:38:09| I drink two beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20289)|
| 5:38:11| I'll drink three if my wife's driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20291)|
| 5:38:13| I need a bathroom before I drive five miles to Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20293)|
| 5:38:18| I mean, I think it makes the food truck park a much more enjoyable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20298)|
| 5:38:23| There are families there with young kids that need to use the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20303)|
| 5:38:27| And I do commend the cleanliness and the maintenance of the temporary port-a-johns at the food truck park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20307)|
| 5:38:35| But I think restroom facilities are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20315)|
| 5:38:38| I'm not going to make any argument for permanent or temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20318)|
| 5:38:43| I do think that restroom facilities are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20323)|
| 5:38:47| Could I just say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20327)|
| 5:38:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20328)|
| 5:38:49| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20329)|
| 5:38:50| So one small distinction, and to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20330)|
| 5:38:52| is that the only reason that we're on the temporary use permit now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20332)|
| 5:38:56| and the only reason that we would have to classify ourselves as a food truck park under this recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20336)|
| 5:39:03| is that we want to park food trucks in a density that is in excess of what the current MFU ordinance allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20343)|
| 5:39:12| So an interesting distinction is just like Lauren was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20352)|
| 5:39:16| any private property in the city right now could park, I forget the exact limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20356)|
| 5:39:20| I believe if it's a half acre or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20360)|
| 5:39:23| they have the ability to park up to two food trucks, and they would not have the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20363)|
| 5:39:27| So they can park those trucks there by right and would not have a requirement to provide restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20367)|
| 5:39:33| So we're really talking about going over the threshold of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20373)|
| 5:39:37| which makes us a food truck park and not just any private property that is hosting food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20377)|
| 5:39:44| Sir, please state your name again so he can catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20384)|
| 5:39:47| Scott Larrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20387)|
| 5:39:48| Spell that last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20388)|
| 5:39:49| L-A-R-R-I-C-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20389)|
| 5:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20392)|
| 5:39:54| Councilwoman St. Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20394)|
| 5:39:56| Oh, see I just turned that on by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20396)|
| 5:39:59| But I was going to say, I think if we made an exception for Market Square Mall for so many years until the city built something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20399)|
| 5:40:07| this is also a new concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20407)|
| 5:40:10| I think in supporting it we should allow temporary port-a-toys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20410)|
| 5:40:14| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20414)|
| 5:40:16| Just from an administrative, I mean, I think I appreciate Peter's thinking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20416)|
| 5:40:23| like what does it look like to have the port-a-potties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20423)|
| 5:40:25| But I have to say I personally agree with you, what you just said, that this is a new concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20425)|
| 5:40:30| There's great traction to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20430)|
| 5:40:34| I'm comfortable with us making it that restroom facilities are required for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20434)|
| 5:40:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20442)|
| 5:40:44| Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20444)|
| 5:40:45| That they not be required to be permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20445)|
| 5:40:47| And I think the nature of food truck parks, I mean, food trucks are mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20447)|
| 5:40:51| They're very temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20451)|
| 5:40:52| You have to have mobile bathroom facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20452)|
| 5:40:54| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20454)|
| 5:40:55| To require the property owners to build permanent, you know, they're going to have to make an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20455)|
| 5:40:59| I mean, I think one reason it's there is that the owners, I think they may dream for something else on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20459)|
| 5:41:05| but it's a great use in between projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20465)|
| 5:41:11| It's really an enhancement to the community and, you know, to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20471)|
| 5:41:15| But the nature of food trucks are they're temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20475)|
| 5:41:18| I mean, they're driving home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20478)|
| 5:41:20| I don't know if they drive home every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20480)|
| 5:41:22| Required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20482)|
| 5:41:24| You know, they drive home every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20484)|
| 5:41:25| So you're requiring a permanent structure for, you know, just simply a temporary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20485)|
| 5:41:36| Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20496)|
| 5:41:38| Technically speaking, situations like, well, we've got other folks trying to do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20498)|
| 5:41:45| and they want to use a permanent building as part of it, as the assembly space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20505)|
| 5:41:51| And that has restrooms in it right now that don't meet code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20511)|
| 5:41:57| And that's one of the requirements for us out of the building code because they're using the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20517)|
| 5:42:03| They have to provide restrooms, and they're going to invest money to update those restrooms to meet ADA access requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20523)|
| 5:42:11| I'll have to think through, we'll have to think through how this will function in those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20531)|
| 5:42:18| where they've got noncompliant restrooms, and they say, oh, we don't have to provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20538)|
| 5:42:23| We're just going to put a portage on outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20543)|
| 5:42:26| You following me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20546)|
| 5:42:27| Yeah, but they have a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20547)|
| 5:42:30| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20550)|
| 5:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20551)|
| 5:42:32| You shouldn't say you don't have to bring your building up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20552)|
| 5:42:36| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20556)|
| 5:42:37| This is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20557)|
| 5:42:38| That's not a 9 p.m. question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20558)|
| 5:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20560)|
| 5:42:41| What if instead of voting on it tonight, we direct staff to bring back a resolution that would look at those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20561)|
| 5:42:53| I think your language would need to make it more of a temporary, make it more temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20573)|
| 5:42:57| Because if it's permanent, I mean, you're competing with businesses that have invested a lot of money and, you know, that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20577)|
| 5:43:05| You're competing against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20585)|
| 5:43:06| So I think you've got to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20586)|
| 5:43:07| But I think if you want it to be temporary and they're just going to be there, he's there on a three-year deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20587)|
| 5:43:12| then you make your ordinance look and sound more temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20592)|
| 5:43:16| It's not a permanent use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20596)|
| 5:43:17| It's a temporary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20597)|
| 5:43:19| And let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20599)|
| 5:43:22| Is the motion on the floor to strike permanent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20602)|
| 5:43:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20605)|
| 5:43:26| That's the motion on the floor to strike permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20606)|
| 5:43:29| So is that how you want to leave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20609)|
| 5:43:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20612)|
| 5:43:33| So before we get a second on that, let me ask a really quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20613)|
| 5:43:37| So how do we, you know, I do agree that there needs to be something that's going to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20617)|
| 5:43:44| if there is a food park that's in an area where there is a structured building that has restroom facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20624)|
| 5:43:53| are those required to be ADA just because they are a building in general, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20633)|
| 5:43:58| whether there's a food truck park there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20638)|
| 5:44:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20642)|
| 5:44:05| So would that be covered by default or do we need to have that listed somewhere in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20645)|
| 5:44:13| I always think of the worst case scenario because that's when I get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20653)|
| 5:44:20| And what I'm envisioning is our applicants saying, yeah, there's a building there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20660)|
| 5:44:27| but we're just not going to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20667)|
| 5:44:29| And so we'll throw some Fort-O-Johns outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20669)|
| 5:44:32| knowing full well that the doors are going to be open on Friday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20672)|
| 5:44:35| That's something we can address on the maintenance side post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20675)|
| 5:44:41| If the direction from council is to strike permanent restroom facilities, we can work through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20681)|
| 5:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20689)|
| 5:44:50| And for the record, I was not trying to deprive Gerald of Port-a-Potty or restroom facilities after you had a couple of beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20690)|
| 5:44:57| I was more concerned about depriving me of a couple of beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20697)|
| 5:45:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20701)|
| 5:45:02| So I don't think it was to strike permanent restroom facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20702)|
| 5:45:05| It was just to strike the word permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20705)|
| 5:45:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20708)|
| 5:45:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20709)|
| 5:45:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20710)|
| 5:45:11| So the motion on the floor is to strike the word permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20711)|
| 5:45:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20714)|
| 5:45:16| That restroom facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20716)|
| 5:45:18| Permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20718)|
| 5:45:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20719)|
| 5:45:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20720)|
| 5:45:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20721)|
| 5:45:22| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20722)|
| 5:45:23| Are you all ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20723)|
| 5:45:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20725)|
| 5:45:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20726)|
| 5:45:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20727)|
| 5:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20729)|
| 5:45:30| So it passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20730)|
| 5:45:33| But then if you think of if there are other ways you think this needs to be addressed based on the other scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20733)|
| 5:45:38| you should bring that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20738)|
| 5:45:40| If there's some language to make it clear when those apply and if there's other scenarios, I'll bring something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20740)|
| 5:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20751)|
| 5:45:52| We can look at the codifying the temporariness of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20752)|
| 5:45:56| The other thing is they've screened them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20756)|
| 5:45:59| They're not just thrown on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20759)|
| 5:46:01| And they do have an ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20761)|
| 5:46:04| Scott, you have ADA compliant Port-a-Potties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20764)|
| 5:46:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20769)|
| 5:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20770)|
| 5:46:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20773)|
| 5:46:14| It's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20774)|
| 5:46:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20775)|
| 5:46:16| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20776)|
| 5:46:17| Seema, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20777)|
| 5:46:18| I have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20778)|
| 5:46:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20779)|
| 5:46:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20780)|
| 5:46:21| If I can direct everyone to page 9-30 under section G4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20781)|
| 5:46:28| This is regarding temporary outdoor entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20788)|
| 5:46:31| And one, it says temporary outdoor entertainment in the residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20791)|
| 5:46:35| is restricted to those events associated with and conducted by a place of worship, educational facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20795)|
| 5:46:40| or registered neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20800)|
| 5:46:43| Then we go down to four, and it says time limits as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20803)|
| 5:46:47| On C, it says events in non-residential districts are limited to four events per county year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20807)|
| 5:46:52| and a maximum duration of 15 days per event with a minimum of 30 days between events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20812)|
| 5:46:58| And this is in non-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20818)|
| 5:47:00| No, it says down on C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20820)|
| 5:47:02| Down on C, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20822)|
| 5:47:04| So I'm fully in agreement with 4B, that events in residential districts are limited to four events per county year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20824)|
| 5:47:13| But in C, I need to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20833)|
| 5:47:15| So if there is a church that has an outdoor festival, that would be considered one event, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20835)|
| 5:47:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20842)|
| 5:47:23| And that means that if an educational facility or a nonprofit wanted to do some type of event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20843)|
| 5:47:29| they would have to wait 30 days before they could schedule or apply to have their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20849)|
| 5:47:39| And I'm going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20859)|
| 5:47:41| I'll try to answer this, then I'll look to Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20861)|
| 5:47:43| But I think the intent is at the same location, at that church, they could only have four events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20863)|
| 5:47:51| But the school that's down the street could have four events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20871)|
| 5:47:56| There are separate entities applying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20876)|
| 5:47:59| And this applies not to the district as a whole, but to the entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20879)|
| 5:48:03| And I'm hoping that's correct because it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20883)|
| 5:48:10| I just want to make sure I have the interpretation correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20890)|
| 5:48:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20894)|
| 5:48:21| Give us a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20901)|
| 5:48:26| It's at the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20906)|
| 5:48:28| Again, that church, regardless of who held it, if a neighborhood association had an event at the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20908)|
| 5:48:34| the church had an event, the school had the event, that's three events at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20914)|
| 5:48:39| So they could not, they'd only have one more at that location during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20919)|
| 5:48:43| But if the school had their event at the school down the street, on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20923)|
| 5:48:48| the neighborhood association had their event at the park, they would not be grouped in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20928)|
| 5:48:55| So should we maybe add some verbatim that says per event location, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20935)|
| 5:49:01| We can clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20941)|
| 5:49:03| Yeah, because when I first read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20943)|
| 5:49:05| Applies to the lot, not the operator in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20945)|
| 5:49:07| In 4A, does that cover that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20947)|
| 5:49:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20950)|
| 5:49:11| The on-site presence of a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20951)|
| 5:49:15| Oh, timeline change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20955)|
| 5:49:17| To the lot, not the operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20957)|
| 5:49:18| Can we commit to re-looking at temporary outdoor sales the next time, or you want to hit it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20958)|
| 5:49:27| Whoever wants to do it can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20967)|
| 5:49:29| Okay, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20969)|
| 5:49:30| You're right, Seema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20970)|
| 5:49:31| I can't hear everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20971)|
| 5:49:33| I feel like we're running out of steam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20973)|
| 5:49:35| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20975)|
| 5:49:36| And I feel like there's a lot to discuss with temporary outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20976)|
| 5:49:39| So I don't want to not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20979)|
| 5:49:41| I guess just piggybacking on what Councilperson McKenzie is talking about in temporary outdoor entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20981)|
| 5:49:46| I do think there's a problem on page 930, section G, which is the temporary outdoor entertainment, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20986)|
| 5:49:57| In the current ordinance, it actually makes it clear that several of the things that are envisioned for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=20997)|
| 5:50:04| are not allowed in residential as a temporary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21004)|
| 5:50:09| Those things were taken out of the definition, which I think was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21009)|
| 5:50:14| But what you're really looking at here is if you are associated with, let's see, what was the word they used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21014)|
| 5:50:23| Conducted by a place of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21023)|
| 5:50:25| So I'm a member of a church, and I say, oh, my house is perfect for this band performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21025)|
| 5:50:34| You're going to have a band performance in the house next door for the amount of time that's prescribed in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21034)|
| 5:50:41| which at least there's some time limits now, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21041)|
| 5:50:44| I don't think that's what people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21044)|
| 5:50:46| And when we had this discussion in the second district meeting, that's what was said was, hey, we don't want that in the house next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21046)|
| 5:50:55| So what my suggestion would be is to change that language to temporary outdoor entertainment in residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21055)|
| 5:51:02| is restricted to those events associated with, conducted by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21062)|
| 5:51:07| and located on the site of a place of worship or educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21067)|
| 5:51:14| And I'll speak to the issue that was brought up by our Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21074)|
| 5:51:22| Neighborhood associations often have events at parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21082)|
| 5:51:26| So how do we treat that under your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21086)|
| 5:51:31| How would we allow a neighborhood association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21091)|
| 5:51:34| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21094)|
| 5:51:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21095)|
| 5:51:36| No, I mean, I understand what the point is, but I think the other issue you have is how do you define what a neighborhood organization is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21096)|
| 5:51:43| They're registered by, this is registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21103)|
| 5:51:45| Well, if you talk to the Office of Neighborhoods right now, they're going through some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21105)|
| 5:51:51| And it's currently such that I could basically say, hey, I'm this neighborhood, and I'm going to register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21111)|
| 5:51:58| And so it's maybe not as stringent as it will be maybe later in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21118)|
| 5:52:04| So I know that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21124)|
| 5:52:05| Those changes are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21125)|
| 5:52:08| I don't have a problem with neighborhood organizations having events at parks or at a worship facility site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21128)|
| 5:52:14| Or the issue is what could this turn into in the house next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21134)|
| 5:52:19| And there were probably good reasons why some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21139)|
| 5:52:22| Maybe a circus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21142)|
| 5:52:25| The circus was prohibited, and the carnival was prohibited in residential zones as a temporary use next door in the current iteration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21145)|
| 5:52:37| So I just think we've got to be a little bit careful here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21157)|
| 5:52:40| And if we limit it to the site, we can always come back later and say, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21160)|
| 5:52:44| we're having a problem with getting neighborhood organizations to be able to have events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21164)|
| 5:52:47| Let's figure out a way to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21167)|
| 5:52:49| Maybe at that time we have more vetting that goes on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21169)|
| 5:52:56| To save time, I guess, I would say that basically the same change would be on 931, temporary outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21176)|
| 5:53:06| That's subsection H, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21186)|
| 5:53:09| And that would be temporary outdoor sales in the residential districts is restricted to those events associated with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21189)|
| 5:53:16| conducted by, and located on the site of a place of worship or educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21196)|
| 5:53:21| This one is similar in the sense that we're talking about flea markets in the house next door now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21201)|
| 5:53:29| And if you read the definition of temporary outdoor sales, we're not talking about garage sales, keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21209)|
| 5:53:38| This is temporary structures where goods are sold, such as consignment auctions, arts and crafts fairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21218)|
| 5:53:44| flea markets, rummage sales, temporary vehicle sales, and holiday sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21224)|
| 5:53:49| When we talked about that, folks weren't so excited about that being next door either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21229)|
| 5:53:58| So you kind of went off script from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21238)|
| 5:54:02| I know, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21242)|
| 5:54:05| So my thought is neighborhood associations, if they're going to have something in a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21245)|
| 5:54:10| then they would just follow the guidelines for a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21250)|
| 5:54:13| They'd reserve the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21253)|
| 5:54:15| Maybe we need to table this one to the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21255)|
| 5:54:18| because I do think that there's probably a lot more conversation around this that would probably take us over 10 o'clock tonight in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21258)|
| 5:54:25| So if you guys are in agreement with that, maybe we can table this one along with the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21265)|
| 5:54:30| No, we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21270)|
| 5:54:32| Just come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21272)|
| 5:54:33| Come back to non.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21273)|
| 5:54:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21274)|
| 5:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21275)|
| 5:54:37| In the meantime, if you've got some ideas, rather than catching staff cold on May 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21277)|
| 5:54:45| if you want to talk individually with staff about some ideas, that way they're not caught cold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21285)|
| 5:54:52| and they can be thinking about some potentials, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21292)|
| 5:54:56| or if you have a they can draft an amendment or you can draft an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21296)|
| 5:55:02| so that there's something written that people can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21302)|
| 5:55:05| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21305)|
| 5:55:06| A councilwoman writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21306)|
| 5:55:07| I won't talk about temporary outdoor anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21307)|
| 5:55:10| I just wanted to say, are we saying we're going to pick up Chapter 9, whatever, Article 9, at the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21310)|
| 5:55:19| which is already a scheduled meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21319)|
| 5:55:21| or is there the prospect of having a discussion at the end of any council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21321)|
| 5:55:28| Because do we have two council meetings before then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21328)|
| 5:55:32| Or maybe we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21332)|
| 5:55:33| We have a council meeting on the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21333)|
| 5:55:37| It depends on what the agenda is like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21337)|
| 5:55:39| You pick it up on the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21339)|
| 5:55:40| By the way, you didn't get the agenda because I didn't have time today to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21340)|
| 5:55:45| Well, we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21345)|
| 5:55:46| I got an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21346)|
| 5:55:47| I haven't had time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21347)|
| 5:55:49| Did you draft one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21349)|
| 5:55:50| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21350)|
| 5:55:51| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21351)|
| 5:55:52| Draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21352)|
| 5:55:53| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21353)|
| 5:55:54| I thought I had not thought of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21354)|
| 5:55:55| Anyway, it was just a thought to throw out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21355)|
| 5:55:57| I hear you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21357)|
| 5:55:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21359)|
| 5:56:00| I didn't want you to go too many nights without talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21360)|
| 5:56:03| I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21363)|
| 5:56:04| Okay, so, council, when we so we've pulled back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21364)|
| 5:56:10| Were there any motions out there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21370)|
| 5:56:12| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21372)|
| 5:56:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21373)|
| 5:56:14| So we start on actually one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21374)|
| 5:56:18| We've got several things from 1 through 8, maybe 1 through 9, that we've already asked them to come back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21378)|
| 5:56:26| So I think it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21386)|
| 5:56:29| My suggestion is that we start with those while they're fresher on our minds, and for 1 through 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21389)|
| 5:56:38| and then we start with this, right, on 9, and then we keep moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21398)|
| 5:56:44| Now, one thing we didn't get to and we won't get to is the issue of the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21404)|
| 5:56:49| So look at those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21409)|
| 5:56:51| Be thinking about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21411)|
| 5:56:52| If you want any clarification, talk to Gerald about it on kind of what the pros and cons are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21412)|
| 5:56:59| We've heard several through this conversation tonight, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21419)|
| 5:57:03| And then hopefully, you know, if we get through the 18 and can then get to the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21423)|
| 5:57:09| then we will on the 30th, or we will then start seeing when we can work this into the schedule, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21429)|
| 5:57:18| But it would be helpful in that at least four weeks in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21438)|
| 5:57:24| if we had enough to where people can be looking at where we are now, right, what these amendments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21444)|
| 5:57:32| Okay, so there's plenty of time for public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21452)|
| 5:57:35| Does that take a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21455)|
| 5:57:37| Are we just going to agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21457)|
| 5:57:38| I think if there's no objection, then that's how we'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21458)|
| 5:57:41| We'll start with the amendments to 1 through 8 that we've asked you to come back with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21461)|
| 5:57:45| and then we'll deal with 9, and then we will move on, 10 through 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21465)|
| 5:57:51| Mary, I'd like to just thank everyone who's hung in there with us this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21471)|
| 5:57:54| and provided your feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21474)|
| 5:57:56| We really appreciate that and hope that you'll join us again at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21476)|
| 5:58:00| And, Mary, I'd like to personally thank you for feeding us and our public supporters who came out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21480)|
| 5:58:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21487)|
| 5:58:08| That was really nice of you to feed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21488)|
| 5:58:09| Well, Council's feeding you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21489)|
| 5:58:10| I'm feeding them, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21490)|
| 5:58:12| Just for the record, I'm not paying for all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21492)|
| 5:58:14| Out of her retirement, she's going to have to stay on the next trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21494)|
| 5:58:17| Yeah, I've got to stay for my retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21497)|
| 5:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21499)|
| 5:58:20| I'd like to make sure that there's a postponement on the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21500)|
| 5:58:24| I want to make sure there's a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21504)|
| 5:58:26| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21506)|
| 5:58:27| Well, so do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21507)|
| 5:58:29| Move to postpone to May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21509)|
| 5:58:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21511)|
| 5:58:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21512)|
| 5:58:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21513)|
| 5:58:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21514)|
| 5:58:35| But is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21515)|
| 5:58:37| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21517)|
| 5:58:38| Is it on the 30th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21518)|
| 5:58:41| Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21521)|
| 5:58:43| It's May 30th at 3 p.m., correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21523)|
| 5:58:45| So, clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21525)|
| 5:58:47| Since we haven't finished reviewing, are we going to finish and then perhaps consider a vote on the 30th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21527)|
| 5:58:56| Well, here's the problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21536)|
| 5:58:58| We won't have a zoning map to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21538)|
| 5:59:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21540)|
| 5:59:02| Seeing how tonight, today went, I don't, I mean, I'm not holding my breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21542)|
| 5:59:05| I think we have a long way to go because the real issue, I mean, I think that's going to be really difficult is the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21545)|
| 5:59:12| And, I mean, it took us six and a half hours, and we got through, what, half the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21552)|
| 5:59:20| So we've got a long way to go, and I don't think we should send out the signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21560)|
| 5:59:24| We're trying to rush to get this through, and I think today's process should send that signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21564)|
| 5:59:28| I don't think there's any signal given tonight that we're rushing this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21568)|
| 5:59:32| So I think what we are doing is working through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21572)|
| 5:59:37| I think at the end of, there are, you don't have an ordinance without a zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21577)|
| 5:59:44| You could vote to, after working through all of this, if you are comfortable, you could vote to approve the text contingent on a zoning map being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21584)|
| 5:59:59| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21599)|
| 6:00:00| And none of this would go into effect until there is a zoning map that accompanies it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21600)|
| 6:00:06| I'm not saying whether we should do that or not, but that's one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21606)|
| 6:00:09| That gives some, at some point it will give some finality to the public and to us that this is where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21609)|
| 6:00:17| There's still things like, you know, building heights that once something gets passed, then we'll go through a whole process to see if, for the industrial, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21617)|
| 6:00:27| It was industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21627)|
| 6:00:28| And that's a whole separate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21628)|
| 6:00:30| So we could say, okay, this is where we are and this is where we're going to come down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21630)|
| 6:00:37| And then, but it won't go into effect until we have our zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21637)|
| 6:00:41| So that's one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21641)|
| 6:00:42| Or after May 30th or a future meeting, you may say, okay, we think we have it where we are, but we're going to wait on the zoning map and then vote on it altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21642)|
| 6:00:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21651)|
| 6:00:52| We could do either option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21652)|
| 6:00:54| That's something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21654)|
| 6:00:55| Where are you more comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21655)|
| 6:00:56| At least getting some finality here while you work on the zoning map or waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21656)|
| 6:01:02| When do we need to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21662)|
| 6:01:05| I would say at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21665)|
| 6:01:07| There can be a discussion, you know, depending on how long it takes and, you know, how everybody feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21667)|
| 6:01:13| But, I mean, the way today went, there was a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21673)|
| 6:01:15| We've got to get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21675)|
| 6:01:16| I mean, that's likely to happen in Sections 9 through 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21676)|
| 6:01:20| You know, so, I mean, I don't have the expectation we had to vote on it on May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21680)|
| 6:01:25| And then we still have the big discussion on the maps of just the plan on what to do with the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21685)|
| 6:01:31| And just for the record, I don't have an expectation either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21691)|
| 6:01:34| If we were at some point where it felt right and council wanted to do it, then good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21694)|
| 6:01:38| But that's not our driving expectation that there's a final vote on this on May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21698)|
| 6:01:44| But I did want to just caution everybody in the terminology and the way we discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21704)|
| 6:01:52| Nobody's, we are not driving this, we're not trying to drive this too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21712)|
| 6:01:58| We're trying to do what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21718)|
| 6:02:00| And that's why, you know, that's why in the very beginning we talked about everything now is in this public setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21720)|
| 6:02:07| We're going to take the time we need to go through everything that people want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21727)|
| 6:02:12| We've been, you know, suspended a lot of our rules on how we let people come up at all different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21732)|
| 6:02:18| But I think it worked tonight for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21738)|
| 6:02:21| And so I think this is how we will get through this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21741)|
| 6:02:26| And this is how we'll get through the map to figure things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21746)|
| 6:02:30| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21750)|
| 6:02:32| Did you want to say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21752)|
| 6:02:33| I just wanted to say we thanked you for pizza or whatever part that I didn't eat of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21753)|
| 6:02:39| I wanted to thank you for the leadership and everyone's patience and guiding our own patience with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21759)|
| 6:02:47| And I want to thank the staff and the, I apologize for the lack of sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21767)|
| 6:02:51| I think this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21771)|
| 6:02:52| It's important to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21772)|
| 6:02:54| They wanted us to thoroughly vet this and go through it and to give people confidence in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21774)|
| 6:03:00| So I appreciate everybody going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21780)|
| 6:03:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21783)|
| 6:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21784)|
| 6:03:05| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21785)|
| 6:03:06| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21786)|
| 6:03:08| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21788)|
| 6:03:09| We haven't voted on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21789)|
| 6:03:10| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21790)|
| 6:03:11| Thank you, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21791)|
| 6:03:12| I'm in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21792)|
| 6:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21793)|
| 6:03:14| So the motion is to vote, is to postpone any action on the amended ordinance to date until May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21794)|
| 6:03:26| And then, again, it can be postponed again, which we probably will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21806)|
| 6:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21811)|
| 6:03:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=21812)|
