| 0:00:00| All right, it's 5.30, I'm going to go ahead and call this Knoxville City Council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| for complete streets and some discussion on changing times when we start our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=7)|
| 0:00:17| Councilwoman Palmer, if you'll lead us in the pledge and Mayor Brown, the invocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=17)|
| 0:00:23| will come up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=23)|
| 0:00:25| Let's bow our heads, dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=25)|
| 0:00:30| to serve our city, as a special blessing upon each and every person that's here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| Thank you for our police and our firemen who protect us, go with us and guide us, give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=38)|
| 0:00:45| us fire, and many saints, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=45)|

| 0:01:39| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| All right, now we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Could you give your name and address, please, for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| My name's Amy Benner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| My address is 402 East Oak Hill Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| And I want to thank you all for allowing us to have this workshop this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| I think I'm familiar with most of you all, and I believe that you are familiar with our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| which is Bike Walk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| I'm the immediate past president, thank goodness, and Caroline Cooley is our newly elected president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| Monica Miller is going to be our secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| I think she stepped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| She'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| But the three of us are here today, and some of our larger membership is also in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| to talk about a complete streets ordinance and how we think that that will benefit the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| A little bit of background on me is I'm a local attorney who has an interest in transportation planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| and administrative law professionally as well as personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| I like to get around by bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| I'm an active or lead an active lifestyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| and I think that this is something that's economically viable as well as healthy for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=154)|
| 0:02:41| Caroline is a local physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| so obviously she shares a healthy background and is also very active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| She commutes by bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Monica is a local architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| so Monica can speak to just as far as design and livability of cities that include complete streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| and she also is a bike commuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| We are a 501c3 nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| We formed in January of 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| and our mission is to create viable, active, healthy, safe communities on the streets of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| Can I interrupt you for one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Can we turn the lights back on until we begin to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| And this past fall, among many activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| we applied for and received a grant for technical assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| and the proposal that we submitted in our grant application was to help design a complete streets ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=215)|
| 0:03:42| for the city of Knoxville and implement that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| So as a part of that, we are here to present to you all today on complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| The city of Knoxville is ripe for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| and I think that city council has shown and demonstrated in the past their support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| so I think that this is just the next step in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| So without further ado, I'd like to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| I'm Caroline Cooley, and I'm going to go ahead and start the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| I'm a little worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| It's all behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| Also, Nick, can you see the slides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| We've got them on your screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| All right, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| I'm just not familiar with all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Well, first of all, I'd like to just define a complete street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| A complete street is simply a street that is for everyone, no matter who they are or how they travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=273)|
| 0:04:42| Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transit users, as well as motorists and bus and trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=282)|
| 0:04:52| It's for all ages and all abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| Simply, it's safe, comfortable, and convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=295)|
| 0:05:04| Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transportation users of all ages and abilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| are able to safely move along and across a complete street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| So we wanted to take a look at some examples of complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| If you could give your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| I'm sorry, Monica Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| On this first slide, this is probably what you think of as a complete street, and it is a complete street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| It's sort of the deluxe version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| We have clearly marked bike lanes, sidewalks, planting strips, and enhanced intersection for pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=338)|
| 0:05:51| But not all complete streets are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| This is a complete street as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| There are no bike lanes on this street because it's a neighborhood street with low traffic volumes and speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| It does, however, have a nice sidewalk that's separated from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| And this is a complete street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| It's an urban street with a dedicated bus lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Not all streets need to have the same facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| Some could serve just buses and cars, others cars and bikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| while others could be dedicated to pedestrians and not such as pedestrian malls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| The complete streets approach is all about creating a street network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| This is also a complete street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| It's a greenway that parallels the road, and it can serve both cyclists and walkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| This might be more appropriate in a rural setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| Finally, this is also a complete street because on the rural roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| simply providing a paved shoulder at least three feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| is sufficient to provide a level of service for non-motorized users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=427)|
| 0:07:20| I'd like to review our Knoxville accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| In 2009, Knoxville City Council passed a complete streets resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| In 2012, Mayor O'Hara joined the Leaders Council for Smart Growth America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| Smart Growth America is the umbrella organization of the Complete Streets Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| It provides resources and guidance to communities developing complete streets policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| In 2013, the city created the Alternative Transportation Coordinated Position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| This individual will work with other agencies to develop and connect a complete streets network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=478)|
| 0:08:07| In 2014, we have a bike facilities plan that's beginning very soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| and this is being undertaken to give guidance on developing a comprehensive bicycle network in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=494)|
| 0:08:24| We are very grateful for the progress that has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| and feel that Knoxville should build upon these successes by passing a binding Complete Streets Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=508)|
| 0:08:37| Other cities in the area, their accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| First, I would like to say that in 2009, when Knoxville passed the Complete Streets Resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| they were the first community in Tennessee to support this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| The other cities followed along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| In 2010, Nashville also passed a Complete Streets Policy by executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=541)|
| 0:09:11| In 2012, Asheville, North Carolina adopted a Complete Streets Policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| And in 2014, Chattanooga has a task force that's drafted a Complete Streets Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| and is awaiting approval by their city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=564)|
| 0:09:33| I don't want to ride there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Yeah, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| It's funny because it's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| So we've heard about what Complete Streets are and what they can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| and what we have accomplished here in Knoxville and in our region towards creating Complete Streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| Unfortunately, at this time, most streets here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| and in other cities across America can be described more accurately as incomplete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| So this image here is kind of for fun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| but at the same time it actually speaks to how non-motorized users of our street network can feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| where there are no facilities to help them safely get where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=613)|
| 0:10:22| Incomplete streets aren't safe for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| A 2011 study found that in areas where more than 20 percent of households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| have incomes below the federal poverty line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| the pedestrian fatality rate is over 80 percent higher than the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| Incomplete streets aren't safe for bicyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Here we have a cyclist making the most out of the three to six inches of shoulder on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| between Paper Mill and Wesley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| Now, this is actually on a bike route because there's no other parallel roads that one can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| and the city is working on fixing this particular stretch of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| Incomplete streets are uninviting for bus riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| This, for example, is a bus stop across the Gallery Shopping Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| where we have Stir Fry Cafe and the new Tomato Head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Now, I took the bus there one day and I got unloaded into this pile of round diameter gravel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=687)|
| 0:11:35| so I'm glad I don't have mobility issues and then I had to cross five lanes of traffic without a crosswalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| For the fans of 1980s arcade game Frogger, this might look familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| However, it did not amuse me and I have not taken the bus to that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| and I'm just glad I don't work at one of those restaurants or stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| and I'm not asked to risk my life on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| Finally, complete streets need to work for motorists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| They're still our primary users of our street network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| and still most of the time and design is spent thinking about making the streets work for cars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=734)|
| 0:12:32| You might be wondering about who will be using the complete streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| and whether we should devote our resources into turning our existing incomplete streets into complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| Studies have shown that people will walk to destinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| 46% of people from a survey said they were more than willing to walk one mile to church or school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| and 35% are willing to walk one mile to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| And there is also a growing trend in that the younger people are driving less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| Annual miles traveled by car among 16 to 34 year olds dropped 23% between 2001 and 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=788)|
| 0:13:19| Young adults are driving less and getting their driver's license at an older age than what we have seen in previous generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=799)|
| 0:13:32| In the Knoxville TPO region, 16% of trips are less than one mile, which is an easy walking distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=812)|
| 0:13:40| and 44% of trips are less than three miles, which is also an easy biking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| And you will notice that this is the Knoxville TPO region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| That includes all the rural areas as well as the urban areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| and the percentages would be higher if you just look within the city itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=834)|
| 0:14:05| Who will use complete streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| There are plenty of people who are already using our incomplete streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| and this fellow, I call him Timmy, that's what he told me his name is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| and I caught him at the McDonald's on Kingston Pike and interviewed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| He rides exclusively on Kingston Pike, that's about the only road he knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| and he uses that tricycle for his only mode of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| He was thrilled that I was asking him to pose for a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| He looks like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| We also have non-choice users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| These are people who are waiting for the bus on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| right at the Dean Hill Library, the West Knoxville Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| and you can imagine that it's embarrassing and uncomfortable to wait in the muddy grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| to get on a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| It doesn't appeal to most people who might otherwise use the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| for their commute or to get to their destinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| And this is also right across the street where the new REI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| and Whole Foods stores are going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| This whole area is the home to many restaurants and retail stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| and a lot of employees there that probably have some difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| paying for their transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| And having adequate streets and facilities would certainly facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| getting them back and forth to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Currently we do have kids that do get back and forth to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| even on incomplete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| And they certainly would use complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| The upper right-hand corner is Sequoia School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| That's their bike rack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| So there are kids that are riding to elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| The lower right corner is Whittle Springs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| And I know if you're familiar with that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| which is the neighborhood we used for our Ride for Elected Officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| back in September, some of the roads there have decent sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| and some of them do not have good facilities at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| especially for children that are trying to get back and forth to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| Also, older adults, they will use complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| By 2025, 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| Complete streets policies are important to older adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| because they do want to remain in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| They want to remain mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| They want to stay active, involved, and fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| An 80-year-old person is more likely to walk to a neighborhood church or school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1029)|
| 0:17:17| or to a grocery store than drive their car to a gym to get their exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| As a physician, I have seen the terrible consequences of unhealthy lifestyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| The obesity epidemic is very alarming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| Our health costs keep going up and up because of all the different comorbid diseases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| that we accumulate when we're not active and, of course, don't eat properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| But if seniors can remain active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| there are more benefits than just the physical conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| because when someone is isolated and not able to get out on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| they have an increased incidence of depression, dementia, and poor balance causing falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1084)|
| 0:18:17| Complete streets are for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Sixty-six percent of Americans want more transportation options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| so they have the freedom to choose how to get where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Two-thirds of Americans say they would like transportation choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| Even though we love our automobiles, we do like to have other transportation choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| Knoxvillians will use complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| As you can see, there's a Christmas photo up there with someone on a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| We have about 600 to 700 people that show up for the tour delights in the winter, in the cold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| to ride on the neighborhood streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| We also have lots of people who are using the outdoor trail network in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| both walkers, hikers, runners, bicyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| We have lots of people who would like to get out and recreate in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| and these same people would use a complete streets network if it was available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1161)|
| 0:19:32| So we have heard of who might be using our complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Now let's talk about some of the benefits of a complete streets network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| We believe these include improved safety, health, economy, design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| and the consideration of planning for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| Let's start with health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Here's a fun image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| So we've been getting heavier over the past five decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| And as you see, here's the little guy from the 60s, so skinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| Remember when everyone went to the gym in the 1960s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| Probably not many people did besides a few in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| So what's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| I mean, we've been going to the gym more since the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Well, we think part of the problem is definitely our eating habits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| but another element of this is that in the past people got a lot of incidental exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| simply by going to school or to work, whether walking, biking, or catching the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1236)|
| 0:20:45| Exercise just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Now we have to dedicate special time and place to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| and frequently have to pay for the privilege of doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| We think that's asking a lot and that maybe by improving our street network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| and making transit easier, we can get back to some of this past way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| The obesity epidemic is particularly hard on children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| These heartbreaking posters were made by a Georgia nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| and they're fighting childhood obesity in their state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Knox County is not doing much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Our childhood obesity rate is 30%, which exceeds the national average of 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| We believe complete streets could contribute to the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Spontaneous activity helps kids stay fit, but we need to make it safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| Simply by adding sidewalks, we can decrease the number of car pedestrian crashes by 88%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| Some of the complete streets design approaches help to slow traffic down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| in areas heavily used by pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| Decreasing that speed is critical to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| As you see, when pedestrians are hit by a car traveling at 20 miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1329)|
| 0:22:19| nine of them will survive, but only one will survive in a vehicle traveling at 40 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| Decreasing the speed also helps avoid crashes in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| This shows us a view of a driver traveling at 30 miles an hour down Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| which luckily is difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| The faster the car is moving, the narrower the driver's field of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| The field of focus expands considerably at 15 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Now you can see the entire crosswalk, and you can also see the surrounding businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| And you can be enticed to go to Mass General or join the Bluegrass Jam at Sutry's Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1382)|
| 0:23:10| So this is closer to the speed that people drive down Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| and we believe it's helped its economic vitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| Walkable neighborhoods mean higher real estate values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| but there's actually a more important component to the economy issue with complete streets than home values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1406)|
| 0:23:35| and it's the impact that lack of transportation choices has on our low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| In fact, the nation's poorest families can spend more than 40% on their take-home pay on getting to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1421)|
| 0:23:50| How is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Well, the annual cost of owning an average car is about $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| Now, if it's a less expensive older car, that might be much less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| but the number goes back up when you consider maintenance and inefficient fuel consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1445)|
| 0:24:15| Compare that to $300 for owning a bike or $300 for a discounted bus pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1455)|
| 0:24:26| Now, we can imagine with that kind of difference that this money could now go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| when people have a choice, that that money could go towards a local economy instead of just paying for gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1473)|
| 0:24:43| Another issue where we think that complete streets have a benefit is in planning for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| This is Atlanta, and this road's about as wide as a city block or two, yet it's completely congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| And no, this is not the snow day picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| And a 2009 urban mobility report said that in California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| adding road capacity through additional lanes on state highways did not result in less congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| Instead, 60% to 70% of increased road capacity was filled with the new automobile traffic in just five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1518)|
| 0:25:28| At the municipal level, 90% was filled over the same period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| So there's a saying that the city can't build itself out of congestion, but what if we change what we build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1535)|
| 0:25:45| Complete streets can move more people while using less space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Here's a great photo created by the urban ambassadors in Des Moines, Iowa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| showing the same 40 people being moved by cars, by bus, or by bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| The difference is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| And also, finally, we believe that because complete streets are designed for people at the human scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| and not just automobiles, the complete streets approach leads to more pleasant and attractive streetscapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| and gives opportunities for green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1580)|
| 0:26:31| We will discuss what constitutes a complete streets policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| but first let's talk about a complete streets policy, what it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| It's not for all streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| It's not one special street project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| We need to develop criteria for planned usage and use the most efficient movement of users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1612)|
| 0:27:01| It's not a design prescription, not a mandate for immediate retrofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1621)|
| 0:27:10| It's not a silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Other issues must be addressed, including land use, environmental concerns, and transportation demand management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1632)|
| 0:27:24| Some of the elements of a complete streets policy include a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| A vision needs to be developed by the community that includes what it wants for complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1651)|
| 0:27:41| It specifies that all users include pedestrians, bicyclists, transit passengers of all ages and abilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1661)|
| 0:27:50| as well as trucks, buses, and automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| It applies to both new and retrofit projects, including design, planning, maintenance, and operation for their entire right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1675)|
| 0:28:05| It makes any exceptions specific and sets a clear procedure that requires high-level approval of exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1685)|
| 0:28:17| It encourages street connectivity and aims to create a comprehensive, integrated, connected network for all modes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1697)|
| 0:28:33| It also needs to be adopted by all agencies to cover all roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| It directs the use of the latest and best design criteria and guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| while recognizing the need for flexibility in balancing user needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1727)|
| 0:28:58| It's extremely important that the complete streets complement the context of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| Every community is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| Also, we need to establish performance standards with measurable outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| and include specific next steps for implementation of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1758)|
| 0:29:28| So what will be our next steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| We actually took the first step five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| when the city council at that time passed this resolution that's shown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1778)|
| 0:29:46| Now let's look at some excerpts from the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| I'll let you read since you've got screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1791)|
| 0:30:04| So this is just one of the why statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| There were many others there that we thought sounded really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| Here's a section from the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| And here's another section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| That sounds really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| So have we said it enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| This is a great resolution and we're happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| However, what's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Oh, right, it's non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| And that's why we're here speaking to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| because we believe that it's time for the city to make progress on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| and pass a binding ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Now we'll open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| I'm going to hand out just a copy of the complete resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| in case you all would like to just see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| I'm going to hand out just a copy of the complete resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| in case you all would like to just look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1876)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| I don't know who would be best to answer this, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| What would an ordinance to you all look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| What would you all like to see if we were to pass something about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| And even more specifically, I guess what would be some priorities or costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| I mean, obviously those are things that need to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| I think that that's a part of this technical assistance grant we've been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| Pull your mic down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| I think that we're going to be going through sort of an educational phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| with the Safe Houses School folks who have awarded us this technical assistance grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| But I believe that we vision, and I think Monica and Caroline can speak to this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| the city taking, obviously, the reins in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| and having a task force that crafts the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| And I believe that there is a model sidewalk ordinance that did not make it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| that is a base to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| What was the opposition to that or any kind of turn-offs, if you will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Can we let Ellen Zaviska make an address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| I mean, obviously, like new construction or developments or road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| the infrastructure limitations or street widths that can't handle certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| I mean, I know there's a lot of variances to these complete streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| but, yeah, Ellen, why did people not want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Ellen Zaviska.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| I'm on the staff at the Planning Commission and Transportation Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| and I worked with a group that was my microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| I was working with a group that drafted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| It's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| There were concerns about the cost to developers having to put in sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| although it seems like, from what I hear around the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| there's an effort anyway to soon require sidewalks with new development anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| I guess it was just too early at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| I'd like to speak a little bit about the cost question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| As we mentioned, this is not a mandate for immediate retrofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| and it's just to put everybody on an equal footing and demand the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| In the past few years, the city has actually been doing a lot to improve our current streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| There's the Downtown North project and other streetscapes projects that are in the works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| that are working towards that goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| and I think that a binding ordinance would just help keep that going in case it becomes unpopular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2066)|
| 0:34:35| or just to hold developers to the same standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| So, in a way, if we keep going at the rate we are, it wouldn't have an additional cost to it for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2079)|
| 0:34:49| Yeah, I think we've got Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Dr. Lyons is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| I think it would be appropriate to hear from the administration's viewpoint here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you very much, Counsel and Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| From the point of view of the administration, we are definitely in favor of complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| I think we were in favor of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| I think I was a little disappointed that you showed examples of the bad situations in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| but as you say, Downtown North would have been a great example to show of the commitment we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| toward walkable, bikeable streets with less concentration just on automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| If you look, Downtown North, Cumberland is a total commitment to complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| It shows some of the limitations because of the width of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| We had to make some tradeoffs and go to the public for some tradeoffs between the amount of sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| and the amount of bike lanes, but the street diet, of course, is consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| Everything in the South Waterfront plan is dedicated very much toward complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| Washington Pike takes that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| So I don't think there's any quarrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| We were early with the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| We're definitely there with the implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I haven't seen a proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I know we've got Mr. Hagerman and Ms. Wallace here who can speak some to the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| and I know Jim can, that the subdivision regulations are going to make new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| probably require sidewalks anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| You asked about some of the pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| I don't think there was any conceptual pushback on sidewalks other than tremendous, tremendous amount of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| I think that was clearly it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I think we all realize how expensive sidewalks are, so it's just a matter of implementation at the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| So I think we can answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| We would have loved to have spoken with you folks from the administration viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| I don't think we have yet, but this is something that Mayor O'Hara was totally committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| and wanted me to make sure to come today and indicate that it's probably our top priority in all of our redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| and any place that's possible as we move forward is to implement very much a complete street policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| The bicycling, pedestrian components are more and more important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| and the alternative transportation coordinator sort of speaks to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| So I think we would say amen to this effort and to any educational effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| but we're really heading in one sense what I thought coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| We were doing complete streets and four complete streets before I even knew it had a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| Back when we conceptualized a lot of community participation in downtown north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| and began in earnest on Cumberland back in the post-2006 environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| So we're open for any questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| And Jim and Ann, who's very much been dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| and tremendously helpful in implementing the policy we have, are here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Bill, I guess it's appropriate then maybe to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| what's the administration doing with TDOT as far as getting the connection at Fountain City into the downtown area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| What's the latest in terms of what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| I don't know if we've heard back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| We've certainly, I don't know that we've heard any positive back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Unfortunately, we made it very clear we think it's very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| and it almost I would say borders on critical to have that pedestrian bicycle component there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| But we haven't heard that that's going to happen to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| Jim, do you know any more about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| They've pretty much offered to do partial connections because of their budget and the scope of their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2307)|
| 0:38:38| Their solutions are a little disappointing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| but they did put a serious effort into figuring out what was feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| And we will be, I will be asking for some capital money to put in some sidewalks on the west side of Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2326)|
| 0:38:58| And part of that connection was completely out of the scope of their project anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| So that would be our responsibility from the southern intersection of Broadway and Old Broadway up to their ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2344)|
| 0:39:15| That was completely out of their project scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| So that is going to be our responsibility anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| That is also happens to be a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| So we have rather more control over it than we kind of pictured at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| So we also have a little more responsibility perhaps, at least from their perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| So we're continuing to push them to do what they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| and we may just have to follow up behind them and improve what we can improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| So does the city have a plan is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| We're still discussing with them, but we may have to pick up some pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| I want to ask, and I guess I'll address it to Dr. Lyons or maybe to Ms. Benner, but this type of ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2407)|
| 0:40:16| are there any similar sized cities that have already passed an ordinance such as this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| Are you aware or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| I'm aware that there are cities with such ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I think, as they said, there's one proposed in Chattanooga that's being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| It hadn't been passed yet to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| So basically I would put us in the position that we're doing this through policy right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| administration policy, rather than through sort of the command of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| But there are cities that do have ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| And they can speak maybe if research did more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| Does any one of you want to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| I don't have all the details in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| but there's actually a really great document produced by Smart Growth America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| which grades to complete streets policies in all of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| And Knoxville is on there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| And so that would be a great resource that we can connect you with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| I'm not exactly sure who this needs to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| In today's Metropulse, there's a letter to the editor regarding railroad right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| That may be a legal sticky wicket, but are we looking at whatever may be available in that arena?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2492)|
| 0:41:43| I could briefly say one of the things we have on the supplemental budget we brought you is building some sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| in an area near the railroad to account for some limitations by the railroad right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| And, Jim, did you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| The letter in the Metropulse today was specifically asking about greenways on abandoned railroad right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| And there are some opportunities around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| There are also some sticky legalities involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| And that has been mostly an effort that has been spearheaded by Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| looking at it as greenway rather than as complete street or separate street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| In particular, the old Smoky Mountain Railroad right-of-way in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| there's some disagreements about what happens to the right-of-way when it doesn't have a railroad on it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2546)|
| 0:42:38| And there are, even if it reverts to the underlying landowner, which is the most common concept of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2558)|
| 0:42:48| there are still a whole lot of, there's a lot of connectivity that's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| So it is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| It may not be an easy opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Dr. Lyons, maybe you're the one, or Jim Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| Last year I believe that when the mayor was talking about a new position in engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| part of the qualification was that the person had background experience that would be more aligned with complete streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| than simply building a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Did that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Did we hire an engineer with a broader background than building roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| And I'll let Jim be more specific to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| We hired a very serious cyclist who has worked in the city engineering department in Stormwater for, if I remember right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2610)|
| 0:43:43| what, eight years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| Eight and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| He's driven to work twice the last time I checked with him, the rest of the time he rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| So that is his perspective on streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| So we have taken an initial step without an ordinance mandating such a step to begin to look at this from a different set of eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2641)|
| 0:44:10| than we originally used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| And the way I look at that, having that person in the traffic department pushes the whole department to a different culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2652)|
| 0:44:26| It really prioritizes things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| It institutionalizes a different way of looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| That was my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| And that was, again, a step toward moving beyond just building a road and putting a car on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Well, and I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| People are talking about ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| One of the opportunities that we're currently taking is also the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| Working with MPC, the current draft does have a requirement for new development to build sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2694)|
| 0:45:05| There is some cost involved for the developer, so they don't necessarily like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| But building a sidewalk in a new development is much less expensive than going back and fixing it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2711)|
| 0:45:21| It also has some language specifically recommending complete streets approach in new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2721)|
| 0:45:29| and that will probably get tweaked a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| I mean, it's a little weak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| It probably can be juiced up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| So those two items are being addressed directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Probably this spring we'll see a draft, and it will go out for some more review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| You know, Jim, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Jim, the problem, or I think the challenge there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| is there's not a whole lot of huge developable tracks anymore within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| It seems like to me the focus should be on what's existing rather than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| And, of course, the existing stuff is a much greater challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| Topography, right-of-way, those are giant challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| and just the willingness to pay the costs to make that happen are big challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2776)|
| 0:46:26| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| I definitely support taking a look at an ordinance that would include adding sidewalks to new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| That's something that we should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| And, actually, I've talked to Mr. Hagerman and Mr. Lyons, the mayor, about this a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| I think it's something we need to get on track with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| There are not that many developments left or large parcels left in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| but that's the time to get it done, and they're in a position to do it at the most economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| They've got the construction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| You do run into some great issues from time to time that's going to be a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| and there's always ways to look at exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| But, overall, it's the right step, and it has to come as an ordinance, and now it's a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| But you've got to give these guys the proper backing to demand it be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| And it could probably stretch further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| I mean, it's just something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| When it's going in, new construction, you think about a new hospital down on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| I mean, there's a lot of opportunity there that we could, you know, that's just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| But I think it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| I think it could go even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| So this is a good idea, and it definitely needs to be an ordinance, not a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| and I look forward to trying to bring it together and give us something to look at to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| It's just like when we started on our Greenway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| I mean, it was 10 miles, and I think we've got over 70 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| So it kind of feeds on itself, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Yeah, I echo what George has to say about the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Again, if you would refresh my memory a little bit about Cumberland Avenue, did we end up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| I think Dr. Lyons was saying about how we had to make some compromises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| did we end up compromising the fact that we don't have bike lanes on Cumberland Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| And if that's so, has the city looked at another way to get through Fort Sanders or something to help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| It kind of puzzles me that we have a university area where that's probably where an awful lot of bikes are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| and yet here we're talking about that we do one thing, but in the major area that we have students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| we've done away with the bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| So could you give us a little history on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Well, yeah, I'd be happy to talk about Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| One of the challenges with Cumberland Avenue is that there were assumptions made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| when the original planning process was being conducted about the right-of-way width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| and what we found upon more detailed study was that that right-of-way was wider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| the assumption was wider than what we actually had to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| And in order to meet the goals of the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| which were to create a more economically viable, safe, vibrant Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| one of the keys to that was the sidewalk experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| and being able to provide for wide sidewalks, especially during pedestrian-oriented events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| and because we do see a significant amount of pedestrian activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| In fact, I would say I would have to look at the counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| but I would say you'd actually find more pedestrian use of Cumberland Avenue than you would bike use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| Part of the reason for that is that our traffic counts on Cumberland Avenue are so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| We're talking about, on average, daily trips of 30,000 to 35,000 cars per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| Most cyclists who are not expert riders don't want to compete with that kind of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| You also have challenges from the left turn volume where both motorists and cyclists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| and even pedestrians aren't able to predict where that turn movement's going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| And so by putting in a median, by reducing the number of left turn movements on the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| you create an opportunity for a safer environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| It'll actually, we've seen the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| We anticipate a slower but more consistent speed of traffic along Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| And so that means if someone were a cyclist and they wanted to use Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| it would be more conducive for them to use it once this project is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| But that being said, White Avenue and Lake Avenue, parallel Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| will be making the side streets all along Cumberland two-way directionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| so it will provide easier access for someone who wants to bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| who would feel more comfortable on a much lower volume street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| such as I believe White Avenue is less than 10,000 average daily trips, same on Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| So you're dealing with a third of the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| and folks would feel more comfortable using those streets to bicycle in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| and then using the side streets that connect to Cumberland to get to their destinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| In addition to that, we did look at the opportunity to connect better to Tyson Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| because we know that that's a trip generator for cyclists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| and for people wanting to get to the recreational activities at Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| And so we will be providing a wider sidewalk with the Phase 1 project of Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| Unfortunately, it won't be able to have the pedestrian buffer that will have the rest of the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| but we will be able to make that sidewalk somewhat wider and make it feel safer to use that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| especially under the railroad overpass, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| So with that said, as Dr. Lyons mentioned, we did do a very intensive public discussion and process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3075)|
| 0:51:23| and debated and looked at different options and alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And what we found was the best workable solution with the right-of-way that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| to be able to accommodate for the most number of users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Of course, we also have public transportation along the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| and we will be including bus shelters and stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| that will really raise the elevation of public transit users in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| So we felt like, while it's not the perfect solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| it's probably the most ideal solution for this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| and it gets back to the question of retrofitting and how do you do that in the most cost-effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| I will mention also, just sort of tying into the conversation that Jim was having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| with regards to the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| a standalone ordinance is a real challenge for developers coming in who are doing new projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| because the way they approach development in the city is to go to the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| see what's required of them, and then that's their guiding document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| So if there's an ordinance that sits outside of that document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| it's sometimes difficult to direct people and make sure that they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| that that's part of their requirements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| So as we have the opportunity to coordinate and work with the folks at BikeWalk Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| I think we might be able to find some ways to, as Jim was talking about, amend what we currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| so that it works better and has more teeth to it, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| but that it helps the folks know where they need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| without having to find different places in our ordinance to be able to get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| I think we've got one closing comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| I just wanted to say that, first of all, that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| I guess I thought we included some of these things in our presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| but we actually wanted to focus on how much we appreciate the city's efforts towards complete streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| and how much we're doing, and actually this idea of the ordinance is to hold everyone else to the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| so it's not just the city putting in these projects, but actually developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| whenever there's redevelopment or something new, that they're doing this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| And for future generations, so that's always just on the same sort of commitment waiver in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3211)|
| 0:53:43| And as far as the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| I think a complete street policy includes an ordinance, the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| and departmental policies that support complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| So it's actually part of a larger set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| So, yeah, I think we definitely support subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| I don't see any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| I know some council members have other obligations tonight, and we've gone about an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| It seems like there's momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| A very nice presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| We appreciate you all's time and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| I will ask if there's anybody from the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| before we move on to another subject that you all probably won't care about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| if anybody has any closing comments for the complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| We'll look forward to next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| I think there's some support here, and it would be interesting to see how this works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| Thank everybody for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| It's a large crowd for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| And now for the fun part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| It's been brought to my attention, there's been some discussion around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| that I've heard about perhaps changing the start time of our city council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| which would also necessitate a change in the time of our beer board once a month as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| So I had Ms. Mitchell in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| You all have before you the average time of, you know, of completion for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3309)|
| 0:55:16| And I'll just kind of open the floor up and hear what council members have to say about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3316)|
| 0:55:25| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Well, I'll start since I brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| It goes back to our workshop that we had a few weeks ago on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| And the question was, what's one thing you could change, if you could change about council, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| And I threw out the idea of moving the start time to 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| And it's mainly, we all keep, I keep, I'm not trying to say I have any more time or any more demands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3345)|
| 0:55:54| but I keep a really busy schedule and start at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| It just extends the day a lot later than I'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| And I've noticed many times when we get into a really long meeting like we had last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| it's 9-9-15 before we're into the depth of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| And, honestly, I'm worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| I think the people that are here from, you know, from all of us are worn out or tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| We're trying to get through it fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| And, you know, we're just not as sharp as we'd like to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| And I just wanted to bring it on tonight so we can talk about it openly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| and just see if there's any support for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| But, you know, I have a lot of commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| And moving it back an hour would mean me getting home an hour earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| and that would make a tremendous difference in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| I don't think it's any less restricted to people coming and coming to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| We meet every other week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| They meet maybe once in a lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| They get a chance to come to city council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| And I think it's still a very open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| This meeting tonight started at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| It certainly presents its own set of challenges coming at 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| for beer board in this case and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| But I think, in the end, it would serve the people in Knoxville better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| and I think it would probably serve us on council better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| and certainly serve the city administration pretty well, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| But, you know, like you've always said, Vice Mayor Pavlis, this is a democratic world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| So, you know, that's just one man's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| So it certainly has its thorns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| But that's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Well, I'm probably just the opposite of my colleague, Mr. Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| because I know some of my, if I'm talking about personally myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| I know that some of my clients, we don't start meetings until 5, 536 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| And so the 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| The other thing I worry about is also traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I know trying to get back here from Farragut to here from, to be here by 5.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| I was a little concerned about the traffic on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| I don't know what that does to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| I think that before we just automatically make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| I think we ought to know what that does to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| If beer board has to start at 5 and then city council starts at 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| I think that's something to really think about on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| I do agree with Mr. Wallace that it's a democratic situation and whatever we decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| But presently, I personally prefer the 6 o'clock beer board and the 7 o'clock city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| I think, if anything, maybe some of the issues that we get into at city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| maybe we don't need to spend so much time talking about those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| And that would certainly speed up things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| So I personally like the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Mr. Wallace, I respect your need for a little shorter time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| but I must agree with my colleague, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| I did make some phone calls today to some people who appear from time to time at city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| just to kind of get a feel for the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| And nobody seemed to be thinking this was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| They liked the 7 o'clock time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| For people who work and they need to get home and take care of some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| that gives them time to take care of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| It may be an inconvenience for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| You know, personally, it would be better for me to start sometimes a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| But when I took the job, I knew that the hours were 6 o'clock for the beer board and 7 o'clock for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| and so I just had made those personal adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| We also have a colleague on council who maybe doesn't, I guess two colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| who don't have three colleagues whose hours are not as flexible as some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| And I think that it could make it difficult for them to get here at 5 for the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| and 6 for council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| I think in the future it would impact perhaps people who are considering running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| And I know we've discussed getting really good, competent people who follow our footsteps down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| for 4, 5, 10, whatever years it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| But I would be supporting Councilman Gray's thoughts on this, that we leave the times alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| I noticed in the ‑‑ thank you for getting this prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| We've had four meetings in 2014, and each one of those has had something that was extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3617)|
| 1:00:25| And we typically don't have all of those kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| We also have meetings that have ended at 7.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| So, you know, there's not any real ironclad way to know about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| But I would not be supporting changing the hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| You know, I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| I mean, I'd like, you know, a little bit earlier I wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| I think the 5 o'clock is really pushing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| I mean, I know it would push for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| I mean, I have to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| If I've got a 5 o'clock downtown, I've got to leave Blount County really 4.15 to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| because you never know what you're going to get on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| It can be pretty hairy out there at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| And I know that there's Councilmembers who have work schedules that are more flexible than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3669)|
| 1:01:19| But I do think that it could be a detriment in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| If you knew it was a 5 o'clock hard start, I think it's hard for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| We don't get that many people anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| We used to have a lot of people that would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| or some people that would come just in the general audience for beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| We don't seem to have that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| But I think, you know me, I mean, maybe we might look at a 5.30 and a 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| I don't know if that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| You know, 30 minutes is enough time to really make a change, I mean, to make a difference in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| We all seem to be able to get here at 5.30 for workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| And I just throw it out just as an idea as a compromise or just another suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| not a compromise necessarily, but just another suggestion for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| I mean, just my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| I'm probably like everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| It's not a life and death issue for any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| But, I mean, I think it makes a little sense to move it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| But I just haven't had time to talk to people to see really where they're at on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| You know, the couple of people I've talked to, they say a lot of their groups, church groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| have been meeting earlier over the, you know, if you look at the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| And I know I'm on the symphony board, and our shows used to, Thursday and Friday night shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| used to start at 8, and we moved it to 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| And we found that our audience generally liked it, but for what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| I would mirror what Marshall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| I'm comfortable with the way it is, but I wouldn't mind meeting a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| 5.30 would suit me just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Any of the times would suit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| But my schedule is very flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| So for others whose schedules are not quite as flexible, maybe that would be something to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| It's going to be interesting to see what comments we get because presumably, well, Tony's gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| so maybe this won't get reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| He's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| He's not listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| He's not listening to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| He's falling in the forest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| He doesn't start until 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Anyhow, it's going to be interesting to see what comments we get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| And we'll maybe, like Brenda has checked with some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| and I think all of us will talk over the next few weeks and we'll just see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| because I'm quite willing to consider moving it to 6 or 5, 6.30 or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3815)|
| 1:03:43| a half an hour or an hour, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| Councilman Campen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| You know, I'm certainly open to trying a 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| I told George not to get too close to me when I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| Getting off work, I didn't have time to shower and clean up, shave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| So, you know, it is challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| Shaving is a big deal to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| So is showering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| Well, you know, I mean, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| I try to cut out of work early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| I mean, on county commission we met at 2 p.m., and that was very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| And, you know, I think, you know, and we sometimes went until midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| So, you know, that is a little crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| But I'm certainly willing to try a 5.30 start time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| If that's the will of this body, then I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| I think we do need to consider the public's input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| and people that work full-time nine-to-five jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| and trying to get down here to be at a meeting if they care about an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| So, you know, maybe we do need to field some public input before we make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Well, I, too, I'm flexible as far as a starting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| But I kind of like the time as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| And I'm thinking about the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| and especially people that come down here to speak on issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| We start early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| A lot of people get off around five, roughly, I guess, average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| And I think if people want to go home and eat before they come here for a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| that kind of squeezes their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| And then, as I said, with the people who come down for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| I think we have to be mindful of the public and what's best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| So Councilman Wallace pointed out we had a very good crowd here for this workshop this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| which started at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| So I guess people can, he said, all his friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| He got on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| How important it is to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| But those are my thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| And I want to ask the question of you, Vice Mayor, or Mr. Frost, if we decided to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3947)|
| 1:05:55| how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Does it have to be an ordinance or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Actually, it is set by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| So, I mean, I can prepare an ordinance fairly easy, setting the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| If I'm hearing right, this council would be starting at 6.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| and beer board once a month meeting would be at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| And, I mean, we could easily prepare that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| As Vice Mayor and I discussed earlier, I'm familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| The recorder's office every year places an ad in the paper that basically announces the time of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| And, you know, you'd have to run that ad again, which I don't think would be that big of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| And then you'd have to give plenty of notice to the public that the time would be changing by half an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=3996)|
| 1:06:47| Yeah, I wouldn't want to do it any quicker than, if we even do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| I mean, I don't want it to sound like this is a done deal because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| the one thing that I want to do is make sure we've got a lot of workshops coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| We have monthly dinners that are sunshine that we can discuss it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| But, you know, I would like to challenge the council over at least the next 30 to 45 days, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| to talk to your constituents, get feedback from them, and see, you know, what the true feeling is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| Because at the end of the day, I mean, we all care about each other's feelings and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| but it's about, you know, we've got to serve the public right and make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| And I don't think the 530 and 630 is a tremendous detriment to the folks that could get down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| I mean, like you see tonight, a lot of folks came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| But, you know, we could debate it all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| I guess Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Yeah, I just wanted to say I think that, first of all, I think it's a good idea that we do talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| especially if we have constituents who come to an awful lot of the meetings and we can talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| But I also think that we better we really need to take a look at the parking situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| and the traffic at those particular times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| I know coming in tonight at 530, I was amazed at the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| So I think there's a number of issues then for us just to say we're going to start at a certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| that we ought to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| The parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Some of us walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| No, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| The other thing is that maybe we make sure that the city county garage is more open than just the top level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| Yeah, the level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| The parking garage, the top level, is open to the public starting at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| So, I mean, I guess I would suggest that we, you know, as we go to our monthly meetings, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| poll people and see what they think about the start times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| And let's, you know, keep it on the forefront and we'll keep looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| I don't see anybody else to speak to us, so I think we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140227?start=4125)|
