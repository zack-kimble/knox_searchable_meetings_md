| 2:26:12| and you'll have up to five minutes to address counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| Hi, Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| So it's no secret I own a lot of property here in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| and pay a lot of property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| I pay a lot of sales and use tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| That's local tax option stays with the city to a great degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| So I have a fairly vested interest in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| and I'm glad that we've got through that and passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| I'm very supportive and happy that our police department got a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| I'm disappointed that we don't see a comparable pay raise for our fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| They also wear a uniform and conduct very important and dangerous work for our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| without which we would not have a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| And the fire department works closely on protecting property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| which is the basis of our property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| That funds the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| So I think that was a very unfortunate event that we didn't find funding for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8825)|
| 2:27:13| I'm also disappointed with all the talk about housing and affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| and increasing our housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| that some very low-cost options are not being pursued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8838)|
| 2:27:24| and that would be a reform of our plans review and inspections department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| We have a clunky system at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| We've had numerous consultants over the years give us recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| which still have not been fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| And we have, quite frankly, from my point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| an out-of-control administrator, Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| that is complicating the process to improve homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| to restore homes that have been blighted to the property rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| and to have them as functioning housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| He is currently trying to administratively destroy a single-family home in the Park City area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8874)|
| 2:28:00| by claiming that because the homeowner turned off the power for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8880)|
| 2:28:05| to save money during the COVID crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| and now she has tried to turn the power back on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| that somehow it's lost its status as a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| and now is only an accessory structure that cannot be habitated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8893)|
| 2:28:18| This has been going on since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| These are the type of frustrating problems that are being presented by Mr. Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8901)|
| 2:28:25| and his department that are stopping and slowing our increasing housing stock in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8905)|
| 2:28:31| That cost virtually nothing to fix the bureaucratic nightmares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| to lower the bar with what's required to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| We don't need tons and tons of drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| The state doesn't require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| And, you know, we've also, the state's been very proactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| and I find this shocking as an individual who's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| I'm both a resident of the city of Knoxville and of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| and in a lot of ways, I'm frustrated with our state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| and some of their roles and positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| but when it comes to housing, they're doing more than we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| as a city that claims to be committed to housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| and I find that utterly flabbergasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| For example, the governor just a few days ago, or a few weeks ago, on May the 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8949)|
| 2:29:14| signed a bill into law that allows us now to build triplexes and quadplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8954)|
| 2:29:20| under the residential building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| That means no fire sprinklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| That means they can be built at a much lower cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| and the state fire marshal says that they will be or are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| just as effective for life safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| Why are we not discussing adopting that immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| That, paired with our missing middle that we've already passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| would be a huge incentive for making housing more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| And in Ms. Parker's point, if we take the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| that we're handing out in the Affordable Housing Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| and we look at the doors that we're creating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| it's $400,000 per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| The units being built by Mr. Boyd down by the baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| are $300,000 a unit in their market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| How is this affordable? How is this sustainable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| I don't think it's the very good stewardship of our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| So if we want to get to the heart of affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| we need to use the tools and resources that our state legislature is giving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| and that are right here in our own house and getting it in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| streamlining the process to get permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| reducing the burden and the delay in issuing permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| having administrators that don't start with the position of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| no, you can't save that house, or no, you can't get that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| And let's get to an operating philosophy of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| yes, we will help you get where you want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| That simple change in mindset of going from an automatic no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| we're going to frustrate you this and make this as complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| and as cumbersome as possible, to getting to a mindset of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| we're going to help the people as they come in to get to yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| Whatever you want to do with your property, within reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| we will help you get to yes, would be a huge and low-cost method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9054)|
| 2:30:59| to enhance our affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| I guess I'm out of time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| Thank you. The next person signed up to speak is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9065)|
| 2:31:22| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| Just sitting in the meeting, watching and observing primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9085)|
| 2:31:32| I know government is supposed to be semi-functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9092)|
| 2:31:40| And this budget process, again, I'd really like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9100)|
| 2:31:47| what each council person would have in mind to adjust the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9107)|
| 2:31:53| what amendments you would just like to put on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9113)|
| 2:31:58| before you vote on the entire budget that the administration presents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9118)|
| 2:32:08| And maybe be a partner, a partner, true partner in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9128)|
| 2:32:17| Maybe you all talk and help formulate some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9137)|
| 2:32:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| But priorities are not lining up with the needs of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9146)|
| 2:32:37| to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| Mr. Marlowe said something interesting about the whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9162)|
| 2:32:48| don't start with a no, okay, just in the functioning of governing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9168)|
| 2:32:56| And we've had multiple people get up here who are working out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9176)|
| 2:33:05| doing good work, hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| Well, I want to thank you for mentioning low barrier housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9190)|
| 2:33:19| But I wish we could get into the nuts and bolts of why we even have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9199)|
| 2:33:27| that conversation about low barrier housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| Because when I was, when I bogarted the Justice Knox City County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9211)|
| 2:33:39| coming together to talk about homelessness, one of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| I had to bogart to get in, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| But then I was told, oh, well, Mr. Roach, you're, you know, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| you know what, you're considered a member of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| an advocate in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| Okay, well, there are other people who are doing the work who weren't invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| The people who are really doing the work are and are doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| And some of them have had the rug pulled out from under them, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9251)|
| 2:34:18| in terms of funding and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| And the city won't make a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| The city wants to give us all these explanations about why it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9262)|
| 2:34:28| quote, not their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| You know, you don't want to take responsibility at any level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9275)|
| 2:34:36| But, man, we can't continue to keep doing this kind of stuff and think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| it's going to be helping people because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9282)|
| 2:34:48| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| And we need to be seriously talking about the relationships between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| county government and the city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| We create an entity, Office of Housing Stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9296)|
| 2:35:02| But you have to partner with, oh, and by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| you create a task force for one simple item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| one simple item that would benefit the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| I'm going to say it, alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9316)|

| 2:35:22| And you create a task force that's going to make it take another year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9322)|
| 2:35:25| year and a half to get something established and get an entity that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9325)|

| 2:36:00| You got priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| Priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| And you can talk about, you can, every time somebody criticizes you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9365)|
| 2:36:08| Mayor, here's what you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9368)|

| 2:36:15| And it really doesn't amount to diddly squat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| And you need to cut that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9378)|
| 2:36:22| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Because it's disingenuous at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9383)|

| 2:36:26| Next person to sign up for public forum is Mr. Smith, Dan Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9386)|
| 2:36:32| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| I'm still on the road, so everything's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9395)|
| 2:36:41| I want to take a page from Abdul, Umoja Abdul-Ahad's book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9401)|
| 2:36:51| He's a wise man, and he said a lot of things that are true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9411)|
| 2:36:58| although he's been poo-pooed sometimes over the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| But I agree with him that that $40 million grant that we got from DOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9422)|
| 2:37:17| should not in any way go toward the $100 million initiative regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9437)|
| 2:37:25| urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| They are not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| There's just no way you can rationalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| You may say, well, he's a white boy, and he don't know what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9458)|
| 2:37:44| You'd be 50% right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| I've read often about Knoxville's plight with regard to urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9468)|
| 2:37:54| and I've heard what Bob Booker had to say about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9474)|
| 2:37:58| and what he had to write about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| The $40 million is going to go in, and if we're careful with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| other than what we've done with some other federal grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| we'll have something to show for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| But it's not going to make up for the chaos and the loss of urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9498)|
| 2:38:24| There are answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| Other cities have taken action, checked them out for best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| I think that's a proper term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| Look right here in our own city at the Central Business Improvement District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| which has been around for over 20 years, which is a special taxing district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9521)|

| 2:38:53| It's worked. It's been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| And there is a way to develop some money for just African Americans where it would fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9537)|
| 2:39:13| There are people who work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| and I know some of them and there are some other ones who are gone now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| but there are a lot of smart people who work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| and there are a lot of smart people in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| who will be more than willing to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9568)|
| 2:39:31| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| I appreciate the opportunity that there is a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240528?start=9577)|
