| 0:01:28| I think everyone got the notice on this, but the annual workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| previously scheduled for September 22nd and 23rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=92)|

| 0:01:41| A meeting agenda with specific times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| and a location will be provided closer to the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=103)|

| 0:01:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=119)|

| 0:02:11| members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| I had the pleasure of spending a day with them prior to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| being sworn in, of course, and we had a really good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| And I'm really looking forward to working with each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| So we have Reverend Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| Butler from the 1st District, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=146)|

| 0:02:31| Steve Triplett from the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| And we're just really glad to have you all on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Not to put you on the spot, but would anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| like to say anything or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=165)|

| 0:02:52| We are so glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| And Superintendent Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Roswick, I believe you have a report for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| I have a few brief updates since our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| I'd like to begin by saying thank you to the First Lady of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| the United States, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Jill Biden, and U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, for visiting Sarah Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Green Academy this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=202)|
| 0:03:22| Biden and Secretary Cardona were in Knoxville to highlight the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| Grow Your Own program, which provides incentives to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| who want to pursue teaching as a profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| I was very proud that they were able to see the amazing work of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Sarah Moore Green and their students and teachers, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| appreciate Principal Robin Curry and her team for making our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| district proud of their visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| I also want to extend a thank you to First Lady Biden and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| team at Pinterest for giving the staff at Sarah Moore Green a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| teacher lounge makeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| This is an incredible gift and one of the many ways that others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| in our community can support teachers at our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| So I was able to go to not the Sarah Moore Green event today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| because there was a lot of logistics from the White House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| obviously that didn't allow that to happen, but I know some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| you were able to join, too, at the event at UT, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| that was pretty exciting for us to see that in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| Last week, there was another important event that took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| that I want to highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| As you know, Knoxville hosted the annual Medal of Honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| celebration this year, which recognizes recipients of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| nation's highest military honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| It was a great privilege for me to meet Medal of Honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| recipients who visited Bearden High School, and I was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| pleased that students at Farragut High School were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| to host a celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Service to our country is a tremendous calling, and I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| that the KCS students have a new appreciation for that mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Very moving stories to hear the folks tell how they served the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| country and just what that meant to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| And I think I was kind of left with just the humility they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| Like, none of them felt like they were heroes, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| that's one thing that made them heroes for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| So great for our students to be able to hear that and our ROTC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| units to be there and watch that happen from our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| The state of Tennessee also today released designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| related to school achievement, and results highlight several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| opportunities for growth for our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Specifically, 29 of our schools received designations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| reflect a need for additional supports, and the district's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| overall accountability score was in need of improvement, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| reflects a ranking in the bottom 5% of scores statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| Academic growth and chronic expertise were the areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| significantly impacted our scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| So I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Our achievement scores, we did see a slight rise in those, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| as we get the other data that's coming out, it's kind of, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| think, in some ways what we've expected for the impact for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| But to be in the bottom 5% of overall accountability is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| where we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| We'll talk about that a little bit more on Wednesday when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| host a press conference at Copper Ridge to talk about some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| of the designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| So we'll talk through some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| But on a positive note, we did have nine of our schools honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| with the reward designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| So I want to say congratulations to those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| That is Bluegrass Elementary, Copper Ridge Elementary, Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| Intermediate, Farragut Middle, Farragut High, New Helpwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| Elementary, Sequoia Elementary, Shannondale Elementary, and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| So I said before, we'll be holding a press conference at 930| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| on Wednesday morning at Copper Ridge to address the data around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| these school designations and to celebrate our gains and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| great work of our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| And then finally, I want to remind everyone that the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| coupon book campaign begins Thursday, September the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| This important fundraiser helps address school needs such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| playground equipment and technology, and all proceeds will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| go directly to the school where the book was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| I'm thankful for the merchants who are participating in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| campaign this year and look forward to seeing our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| join forces to support their school communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| And Madam Chair, if I could, before I end my report, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| also like to call on our Assistant Superintendent, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=412)|

| 0:07:36| Thank you, Dr. Eiswink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| And next up, Ms. Kelly, I believe you have an ESSER update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| Madam Chair and members of the board, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| Eiswink, thank you for giving us this opportunity every month to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| provide an ESSER update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=471)|
| 0:08:00| Or maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| So before I start with our spotlight for this month, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| want to go back and revisit some of the things that we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| about last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| We talked about having an extremely high cost of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| service, as I said, no cost and no service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| So it's a little different than this one, but the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| public service is double that of public service, and that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| something differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| The cost of public service is three times similar to what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| had in the COVID pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| about last month. We talked about having a community meeting so that we could get input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| from the community. But instead of having a one and done, we've decided to have an ESSER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| link that will be on our website so we can get ongoing feedback from the community. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| we're also going to distribute our ESSER fall newsletter the week of September 26. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| the link will also be in our ESSER newsletter so community members, parents can also give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| us ongoing feedback through that link. So again, as a reminder, the KCS strategic priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=538)|
| 0:09:06| are directly aligned with our ESSER focus areas. So for this month, we will be highlighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| success for every student. Under each focus area, we have strategies. And those strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=553)|
| 0:09:22| are going to be measured by what we call impact metrics. For coherence, we have four guiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| questions that we use to determine how we even decide what an impact metric should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| And so we talk about how or what are we trying to improve? What is our system to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| it? At any given moment, how will we know whether we're on track or not? And if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| not on track, we need to pivot and we need to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| So when thinking about impact or impact metrics, we have to be clear on two things. The first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| thing is we have to be clear on the impact of what. The of what will be an intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| or a practice. And then we have to think about the impact on what. The impact on what will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| be the outcomes that we're trying to achieve. Impact metrics are specific, they're small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| they're focused, and most importantly, they're doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| So if you're a visual learner like me, the of what, again, is the intervention or practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| The on what is the outcome. And then there's a feedback loop. And the feedback could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| quantitative, it could be qualitative, or it could be both. It depends on what the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| metric is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| So to tell us more about the strategies and the impact metrics for success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| I have presenting with me this evening, Assistant Superintendent Jason Myers. I also have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| Director of School Culture, Janice Cook. And joining us will also be Dr. Andrew Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| the Principal of Central High School. So with that, Assistant Superintendent Myers, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| would take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Thank you. Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the Board, Dr. Ryswick. I'm happy to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| here today. I'm here, I guess, at all of them, but specifically to talk about the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| we're doing under Priority 4, Success for Every Student. Obviously, the Division of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Student Success is entirely committed to that work. So excited for the opportunity to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| Before we dig in and get to an overview of the work happening within the priority, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| wanted to refocus us on our belief statements. And really, I'm not going to go through and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| read every one. Essentially, what we want to do is keep student success at the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| of every decision that we're making as district leadership. So that's what it needs to, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| we're having conversations, what sort of programming, what sort of interventions, how is this going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| to impact student success? If we're not considering that, eyes off the ball, right? Also, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| committed to making sure that students have the interventions, supports, and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| for some of our students when they're necessary for them to be able to access their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| And then finally, we believe that it starts with a foundation of a safe and welcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| learning environment, and that the learning environment should be welcoming, rather, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| of your cultural differences that you bring into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| So priority four is driven by these five strategies. The first one is our whole child support team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| I'm not going to talk, really, about that today, except for to say that it's in green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| so it's on track. Mrs. Cook and Dr. Brown will be sharing some of the work there. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| the one we're going to be diving into this evening. Intervention supports for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| you'll notice is yellow, which means we have had a setback. I wanted to be noted, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| that the setback is really only tied to two pieces of that strategy, and we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| through the procurement process currently to get those caught back up. So I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| any concerns about us not being on track as it relates to hitting the deadline to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| the ESSER dollars spent. Also important to note is that there's a lot of really great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| work already happening within that strategy, even though it's in yellow. So one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| biggest things that we've done under that strategy is we launched our second project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| search program, and that is our partnership with Covenant Health and Sertoma, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| an excellent post-secondary prep opportunity for students with disabilities who are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| their exit year of high school, and it's really focused on those job skills, employment skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| and if you ever get the chance to come to their commencement ceremony, as they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| through that process of graduating from that program, each graduate in the three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| that we've been with Covenant have exited that program with employment. So it's a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| great program and a great opportunity for those students. In addition to that, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| also expanded our alternate academic diploma curriculum availability also for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| with disabilities, so we're really pleased with that. And then finally, we've made significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| improvements to our independent living curriculum as well. So while we have that coded yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| we are doing a lot of really great work within that strategy, and we're looking forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| getting again caught up once we get access to the additional programs. Intervention supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| tracking system, you'll see is on track. We already have that database built. Christine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| Pope and her team have done an excellent job, and really the focus of that strategy is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| gather data to help us determine how are these interventions and supports actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| impacting student learning, right, or student outcomes. And then we use those data to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| back to the whole child support team to determine is the intervention working, and if not, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| other interventions might we use. So the first three strategies there really build off one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| another as it relates to making decisions around how we're going to serve kids. Maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| of our technology investments. To date, we've installed over a thousand active panels in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| our schools. Freddie Cox's team is, I think, knocking those out at about 20 a day, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| to me seemed pretty impressive that while we're running schools, while they're running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| all of our networks and all our other tech programming, we're still able to install those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| active panels. And then finally, our facility investment is also on track. Again, bear in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| mind that's that fall 24 launch, and as a reminder, that facility investment under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| priority four is the upgrades to the Lincoln Park facility to bring it into ADA compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| and that is where we hope to house our Newcomer Academy, of course, which would be geared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| at supporting those students who are new to our country and enrolling in our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| So really excited to get that off the ground once we have the facility upgrade completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| So again, that's an overview of our strategies and sort of where we're at. Again, very pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| with the progress that the team has made in terms of getting as many of these pieces in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| place as possible, and I look forward to getting the final two pieces of the puzzle as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| as we can with that intervention and support for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| So with that, I want to turn it over to Mrs. Cook. Mrs. Cook is going to share with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| guys tonight the work that she and her team have done around whole child support. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| it's really exciting, and then once she concludes, Dr. Brown will come up and let you know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| it's like in practice. So thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, Dr. Reiswick. So it seems like it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=981)|
| 0:16:29| that long ago I was here. I remember I was taught for five minutes then, and I taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| for 13, so I'll try and keep it short and sweet to give Dr. Brown a chance to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| So let's go back to the theory of action we have for the whole child support teams. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| talked a little bit the last time about fall into your structures. So if we look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| this is our theory of action for our team. If we provide high quality professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| for whole child support team members and staff, then the whole child support team will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| able to align the interventions to student's behavior and academic needs. And then this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1018)|
| 0:17:06| results in improved student's behavior, attendance, and academic outcomes. So that really is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| theory behind the process that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| So if we look at where are we today, where are we from the last time we met? So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| going to look at a variety of different things. The number of teachers and staff that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| trained, the quality of information shared on referral. So that's what the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| that we get from the teachers to make sure that the referrals are appropriate referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| The quality of the whole child support team meeting, the actual process, how we get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| that. Are we spending too much time talking about things that are not related to or support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| appropriate outcomes? Do we run a tight meeting? Then we'll look at attendance, the trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| for attendance, behavior, and achievement. So it's the things that we can glean from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| the big picture as well as the specific students that we need to address maybe as a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| or is it something that we need to address just specifically as a child, each child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| So here we have how we report out. I'm not going to read how we're going to report out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| We can read it. But there's a variety of different places. So we're really at the point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| we're doing the work now and we're moving on. You don't get a variety of data back week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1107)|
| 0:18:36| by week. So we'll be looking at quarterly or semester results for some of these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1116)|
| 0:18:44| and some of these metrics. So to recap, when we met last time, I talked about we had met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| with administrators. So first of all, we started with administrators. We met with administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| We trained the administrators on the foundation, the goals of the whole child support team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| And then we brought members of their teams together. So we met, we had the principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| then we had other administrators, and then we had leading members of their school teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And again, we set the foundation. We basically did the same training for the staff. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| we did a make-up training for some staff. People moved around and there was additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| people added to teams. So we did a make-up training on that first foundational training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| in August. Also in August, we started identifying and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| providing training on some of the specifics for our teams. So we reviewed what the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| child support team was again. But then we discussed what are the specific roles of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| team members. We choose people specifically. It's not just, I'd like to be part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| team, come along. You have a role to play and your expectations of the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| that you bring to the team. So we reviewed what those were so that teams that did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| have members assigned to roles could start thinking about that. We then have produced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| documents that could be used. If schools don't have their documents set up and they haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| been using ones that have been ineffective, then they can look at some of these documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| that we have produced. So we have Google Docs that make it really pretty succinct and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| to address all the needs. So we shared those documents. Schools can take those documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| and they can modify them to suit their needs. Or they can make sure that what they're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| actually covers all the same areas as what we had outlined in our documents. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| we gave the school some reflection. We asked them to go away and then give us feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| on the defined roles and responsibilities they had within their schools. And then to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| look at what supports do you provide for students under Tier 1 and Tier 2. Because if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| going to match interventions with behaviors or issues, then we need to know what's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| and what you use in the schools. So we're having schools do a little bit of analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| of what they have within their building. Members of my team, the Department of School Culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1277)|
| 0:21:27| we have gone out and we have gone and visited with schools and provided them some support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| some feedback. It will take us maybe until next month to get through all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| And we've added more since this was typed up. But we have gone out and we have met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| And what we realized was that there really is different schools that are at different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| levels. We have great work going on in our schools. All schools have participated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| foundational training. Goals have been established. Most schools have assigned team members. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| schools are reflecting. And then the schools are self-identifying their level of implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| based on a rubric. And it's a pretty basic rubric. We do have some schools that are developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| which means that they're really putting together new teams and creating their process. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| have some schools that we're going to go in and we'll give them heavy support because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| we can come in and help walk them through so that they don't fall down any pit holes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1347)|
| 0:22:35| that we know that we can avoid. So we'll go in and we'll support them. We have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| schools that are in approaching where they've established teams and meeting outcomes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| implemented with moderate fidelity. The staff supporting tiers are identified. So they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| a lot of the framework put together, but they need to have it tightened up so that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| have the best bang for their buck when they're in that time. And then we have a few schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| who are reaching effective because they have been doing this for a number of years. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| they have action plans with comprehensive supports. A new element that most of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| haven't met is the root cause analysis because we haven't got to that place there with questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| to address whole childhood. It's actually the supports that kids need. And then we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| to look to see does the data prove that action plans have had a positive impact. So if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| looking at are we doing all this and getting an outcome, the outcome that we want. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| can say that we don't have any school at this point that is fully immersed and effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| but we have some, a few schools who actually have a very solid process to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1423)|
| 0:23:51| So what are our next steps? So the next steps we're going to have is the development of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| the differential training programs and supports for the school. Based on what tier they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| we will divide out the training. We don't want to have schools that have a good process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| sitting listening to very fundamental things where they need more detailed training, more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| training on the root cause analysis supports that may be there. We're also going to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| about the pre-referral training and begin training so that the teachers in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| can know have we looked at other things before bringing a child to the team so that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| getting the appropriate students who are coming to the team. An example would be if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| a child is having struggles with maybe there's some situation at home where the kids come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| in and they don't have socks on or that we're worried about something, that there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| going on at home. Maybe that's really not a whole child support team issue, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| social worker issue. So let's have we talked to the social worker, have we got the social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| worker involved and then go down that path before we actually take it to the whole child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| support team. Then we're going to work on that breakdown of the root cause analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| process and then in October we're going to start looking for our data on behavior and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| attendance. Then as our staff, we're going to have a walkthrough document that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| going to look and see how can we support these schools. So we're going to have a walkthrough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| document and then we're going to develop a library of ten minute trainings that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| can use at the beginning of teams, they can use in staff meetings so that we're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| capacity within our schools. We're building capacity not just in that team but maybe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| their staff meetings or some part that's integrated into their school plan. So that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| where we are at this point. The work is going on. We have the foundation there. Now we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1554)|
| 0:26:03| have to do the work for the next couple of months. It's just digging deep and doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| work that we need to do. So I'd like to call on Dr. Andrew Brown. Central High School has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| had the whole child process in place now for a couple, a year or so, and I'd like him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1574)|
| 0:26:22| share just some of his experience with you. Thank you Ms. Cook and thank you Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1582)|
| 0:26:30| and members of the board and Dr. Reiser for the opportunity to talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| what we're doing at Central High School around whole child support. I can tell you this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| my fourth year at Central. When I first came to Central, there really wasn't a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| in place. So one of the things we started with is how do we support kids, whether they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| struggling academically, behaviorally, with attendance from a social emotional standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| how do we make sure that we're meeting all of their needs so that they can be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| in school. I had some previous experience at Southville Middle School where we had put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| in a PIT process where teachers would submit referrals. So we began with that and started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| to try to do some of those things when I came to Central. Unfortunately, the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| were responsible for kind of organizing that kept changing. So what we had is we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| referral form that was created, we had our own little Google form, and then that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| left and people were still submitting and then those referrals were going somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| but no one knew. So last year, Mrs. Cook and the school culture department approached me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| and said, hey we'd really like to streamline a lot of these processes and we'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| try it with you if you don't care. So of course I was all on board, which was great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| because Jeremy Majeski came over and provided us with a Google form that was consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| and we knew who owned it and we knew where the results were going and so we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| together on a monthly basis and look at the referrals that teachers were making, address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| the needs, and the best part was as we got together as a group, which included administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| and included our social workers and our counselors and all the people who could sit around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| table and problem solve and come up with some solutions to help support our students, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| each time we would get together we would leave that meeting with an action plan for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| individual student who was brought to us from the teachers or from faculty and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| a point person who was going to be responsible for that. And so we left with some accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| knowing we've got a plan and this is the person who's going to implement that plan and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| the next month when we got back together again we would follow up on each one of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| as well as visit any new referrals that we had gotten. So I can tell you as a principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1722)|
| 0:28:51| who's in his 17th year of being a head principal, this process is probably one of the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| things we can do because again we're trying to eliminate any barriers that students have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and make sure that they can access school on a daily basis, whether that means finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| supports for their families like Janice said, if they need socks or if they need food or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| if they're having housing issues, social workers are a great tool in our staff that help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| to find those resources and things they need. It gives counselors and our behavior team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| and different people more information so we can begin building those relationships and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| having those tier 2 and tier 3 processes where we step in and do check-ins or we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| sure that we're supporting those students. And again it's individualized so each student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| we look at we discuss specifically what they're having problems with and how we address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| And the neat part for us is what we saw is throughout the year, last year was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| a change, at the beginning we noticed that a lot of referrals were coming from one or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| two teachers. And so as we looked into those things what we found is we started off by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| supporting teachers and making sure that they had the tools they needed and the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| and we would send in our interventionists or our behavior support people to those classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| and making sure that we were supporting the teachers so they could provide students with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| education they need. And as we moved on into the first and second semester, then we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| began to see as we worked with those teachers and helped develop, as Janice said, some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| the training for teachers and knowing how to refer or what to put into referral, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| kind of information we needed, that enabled us to then build those specific action plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| so that we could make sure we were addressing those students' needs. So I think it's a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| thing. I'm a huge proponent as the person who's in the building and making things happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| at the student level of consistency and I think that this is a great tool that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| can consistently implement this model, and I know each school has their own personality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| and their own unique differences, but I think in general this is a process that supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| kids and any time we can keep that focus, as Mr. Myers said, on the student, then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| heading in the right direction. So I don't know if I should field questions or turn that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1872)|
| 0:31:20| over to you. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, Dr. Brown. Sure. Thank you, Andrew. That brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| us to the end for priority four. So next month you'll hear from Ms. Hummelgarn about great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| educators in every school and we will take questions. I don't imagine that you'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| any for me, but Dr. Brown and Mrs. Cook are here as well. So I just have one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| I believe Mr. Watson has one as well. So the links for community input, are those on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| the website or are we saying we're going to have those on there soon? They are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| not on the website yet. We want that to correspond with when we release the newsletter. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| will be the week of September 26th. Awesome. Thank you. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| Dr. Brown or Mrs. Cook, I'm not sure who's the best to answer this. I appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| all emphasizing that this is really a process that we're talking about that's being implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| in schools. But in the context of that process, I know that there are certain tools in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| toolbox of those whole child support teams. Can you all just talk some about those really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| critical tools that are available for these teams and some of the most impactful trainings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I mean, I don't want you to belabor too much, but just some of those things that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| really key and defining of this process. So I think that if you remember way back when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| I did my first analogy about being at the medicine cabinet, you have a sore head. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| do you take for your headache? Because you have different reasons why you have the headache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| That's kind of what we're doing. As we go into it, we're building out training so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| when students, when we are presented with a student, we have looked at, is this a trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| informed situation that's going on with this child? Is this something that they're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| with culture? Do we need to look at that? Is this a skill deficit? These are all things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| that are obstacles. So as we look at what are we providing, we provide trainings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| all those schools. We give schools trainings in all the different areas that fall under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| the department school culture. What we need to do in this is we then make it really specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| That's when we go into that root cause analysis that we'll be doing in the future. We'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| looking at helping people work out what is the difference and how can we assess whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| it's a difference between a skill deficit and a trauma informed issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you. I really appreciate the clarity. I think one of the things that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| to note, and tell me if I'm saying this back correctly, is that really what we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| to do is help our educators and those in the school building to better understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| is it that I'm actually seeing in this moment. Then based upon what I'm seeing, then I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| able to help get them the appropriate support. Instead of having to own that all on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| own or making guesses about what might be happening or what might not be happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| that it's more of a team approach so that way we can get people to the right type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| support that they need. Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| If you're trying to support a child and it's not working, then you need to be able to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| what else can I think about that might be hindering this child. If you don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| else to think about, then you just, you know, everything's unhealable. You only have a hammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| That's kind of where we're looking at building the capacity within staffs to look at when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| children are struggling or they're facing an obstacle, there are different elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| they need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Yeah, well thank you to you and your team for the investment that you all are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| in our educators and our school based personnel to be able to do that effectively because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| at the end of the day it impacts our students each and every day. So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| Great. So do we have any other questions or discussion? Okay, well thank you Ms. Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2106)|
| 0:35:16| and Mr. Myers and Ms. Cook and Dr. Brown and the entire team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2116)|
| 0:35:25| So moving into discussion of our regular agenda, any comments, discussion on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2125)|
| 0:35:39| 5A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| All right. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| Oh, I'm sorry. I'm on contracts, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| Okay, well, moving on to that. Contracts, items 1 or 2. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2153)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you Madam Chair. Is there a, I know why we're having to do the contract amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| on item 2 related to our transportation services and I know this is probably hard to estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| but do we have any thoughts or guesses what the impact might be from a dollar perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| on a quarterly basis or on an annual basis? I know there's a threshold and we're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| to, we don't have to, we don't, you know, there's a threshold that we have to meet before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| we start paying into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you Mr. Watson. I'm actually going to defer to Dr. Adams and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| his take on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you Dr. Reiswig. Thank you Mr. Watson. Now that you're exactly right, it's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| difficult estimate, but I can tell you, looking at the range from $20,000 to $60,000, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| seen gas prices stabilize and so we're hoping it will be on the lower end, but when we looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| at the total cost of last year and with the increase of this year, that's what we basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| based those numbers on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| So you're saying the range is $20,000 to $60,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| For an annual, for the school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Yes, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you Madam Chair. I have, I guess, a follow-up to Mr. Watson's question. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| a cap that ensures that we don't go beyond the line item budget that's there for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2243)|
| 0:37:32| I'm actually going to bring Ryan up to discuss the contracts. He can get into a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| detail about the actual contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Thank you. To answer your specific question, no. This money comes out of the same place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| that our bus contracts are paid out of, our shuttle contracts, it's all the same line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| item. So there is a speed bump, if you will, built into this amendment, whereas if gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| eclipses a certain level, then we have to bring it back to the board to ask you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| to essentially reauthorize the expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| So if it were over $60,000, we would do this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| The speed bump is tied to the actual price of a gallon of gas as opposed to the aggregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| spend. So, yeah. I mean, the part that's difficult to this is our shuttles are a, pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2298)|
| 0:38:27| they're charged per student based on the distance that student travels. So a lot of how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| it costs is how we route things. So there's not, I don't know, it's a lot messier than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| buses. We use them for specialized populations, homeless population in particular, so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| also a very mobile population. So it's difficult to pull these sorts of things together. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| again, going back to a specific answer to your specific question, there is not a hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| cap that would say like, okay, we're done, we're not going to do this any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| So any other discussion on one or two? Okay. Items three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2350)|
| 0:39:25| Five or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2365)|

| 0:39:35| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you, Madam Chair. My question is actually not about one of the specific educator prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| agreements, but specifically, Dr. Reiswit, because of the Grow Your Own program and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| attention that was brought to that today, can you just speak generally to the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| and the importance of our educator prep agreements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Sure. Thank you, Mr. Watson. So I'll have Ms. Hummelgarn weigh in as well. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| they're extremely important. This is the way we get our teachers certified. What we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| find is the majority of our students who intern with us, this opens up the opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| us to intern a lot of our students and our student teachers and being able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| a lot of them actually stay on when we have positions that are open to be hired. Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| of them we even hire on before they're finished if it's a special needs area for us to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| able to do that. So in order to have the shortages, as you see nationwide and even here, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| more than one, I believe multiple EPPs or educational prep providers to do that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| so they are extremely important. We are our own educational prep provider for career and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| tech education as well, so we can certify teachers in that. But for the most part, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| you'll see on this list, I think, are majority ones that are kind of traditional ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| place interns with us and we very much value those. I don't know, Ms. Hummelgarn, if you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Madam Chair, Board Member Watson, I'll echo what Dr. Reiswig said, very important for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| placement of our interns for Job Embedded Licensure Pathway. Also, the partnership agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| I believe it's five through eleven that are on the agenda tonight, are state partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| agreements, so they're a requirement of the EPP to submit to the state of their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| Okay. Items nine or ten? Eleven or twelve? Thirteen or fourteen? Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2479)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you, Madam Chair. Looking at the community schools MOU, this is just something that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| would like to see in the future as a follow-up to this, since this is a little more general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| for whichever school they determine they want to be part of. Once that happens, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| hope to see also an MOU with the principal and the staff so that we don't go into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| partnership and then maybe we change administrators and they drop that before it gets very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| So I'd like to be sure that we have something in place so that the staff is committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| following through with it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Can I jump in real quick? Thanks, Ms. Owen, for that. So community schools are kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| in a position right now where we're trying to come together with a model, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| the Knox Head Foundation has been a part of that, UT has also been a part of that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| I think both of those entities are working together to try to come up with a model. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| conversation with both of those groups was I want to be able, as the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| to speak to this is what community schools is for every school, and I think that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| you're talking about, too, so that I know some communities have some different needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| and we adjust to that. But overall, we should have a view to be able to tell families and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| schools this is what they are. And to your point, it needs to be something that carries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| on, kind of like the IB program at West. Even if you have a change in leadership, how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| do and what we do on those are important. So I think some of this one in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| was tweaked because there's some change or some additional schools that wanted to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| on to it, and so I think that's why they opened it up for that one, but I think you make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| So items 14 or 15. 16 or 17. 18 or 19. 20 or 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2600)|
| 0:43:51| 22 or 23. 24 or 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2631)|
| 0:44:00| So moving on to grant six. Item A. B or C. D or E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2640)|
| 0:44:24| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Thank you, Madam Chair. On item E with the Elevate program, I know we've just had our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| inaugural year, and it's coming back before the board for this grant. Dr. Roswick, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| you or somebody else speak to that inaugural year and the success of that program and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| we've learned from it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Madam Chair, I'm actually going to have Mr. Meyer speak, but I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| been out to see that, and it is a pretty powerful alternative for those students to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| to have a chance to still attend school even after some different circumstances that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| in. So it is neat. It doesn't feel and look like traditional school the way they do think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| so it's pretty neat, but I'll have Mr. Meyer expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| Thanks, Dr. Roswick. Thank you, Mr. Watson. So a little bit just to, I guess, preface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| with, you know, this was the last year was the first year in a pilot, and honestly a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| pilot that was pretty unique in our state. We're the first, as far as I know, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| the first public school system to try to dive in and develop this sort of program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| So year one was a learning experience for sure. You know, so some of the established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| goals was the student enrollment of 10 students. They had 23 students actually pass through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| the program. Various circumstances led to not all those students staying for the entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| of the school year. They actually ended the school year with eight students, but at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| very end of the school year, three of the students, which would have been for a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| of 11, entered into a more intensive treatment program. So they were just given access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| a different program. So we do feel pretty strongly we would have made that goal. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| partnership with Helen Ross McNabb is essential to the success of that program, so it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| really put the recovery component really at best alongside academics, but honestly is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2766)|
| 0:46:15| even ahead of it as it relates to the amount of therapy that they get access to to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| support that recovery initiative. So that's all through Helen Ross McNabb. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| with that first year being such a learning experience, and we saw that there was a demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| Helen Ross McNabb actually moved the program into a larger facility. So our goal is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| end this school year with 25 students. They have 13 currently enrolled and five more awaiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| interviews. So that process to get, you don't just get to sign up and be in Elevate. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| an interview process that Helen Ross McNabb leads up to make sure that the student is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| actually ready to participate in a recovery program. We also, from lessons learned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| that first year, changed how we do the academic component of it. As Dr. Reisbeck referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| the academic piece there does look very different, but it looks a little bit more standard this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| year. They do have access to live instruction. We've partnered with the virtual school to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| provide live instruction around ELA and math. That's where we saw the greatest area of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| last year. And we're also trying to leverage more Canvas courses as opposed to just setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| students loose on our edgenuity platform to go that way. So we do anticipate that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| would be a higher rate of credit attainment this year. So really excited about the progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| they made in year one. But I think year two, I think we have a lot of opportunity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| Again, just with having more space, again, a shout out to our partners there. Having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| more space, I don't think they'll have any trouble getting that number up to 25 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Thank you, Mr. Meyer. So you mentioned that you said recovery is a little bit ahead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| academics in terms of outcomes, in terms of importance. Is the recovery measured in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| of sobriety, or how are we considering the impact of recovery in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| Yeah, so I mean, obviously, it is certainly the priority. If we can't get the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| past that recovery piece, the academic progress isn't going to come anyway, right? And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| they actually screened, last year they screened the students weekly on a pretty predictable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| schedule. They're actually changing that this year. And so in terms of the screening, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| not just do you pass or fail, but they actually look at the level of a given substance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| see. So like when a student first enters a recovery program, they're obviously going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| to fail the test, right? So the first thing you look at is the level of those substances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| in their system. And then, of course, after that, it becomes more standard in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| are you staying clean or aren't you? And so, again, that part of the program really falls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| more with Helen Ross McNabb. But that's how you track it. It's just a simple, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| you drug screen, and then you see if it's THC, what level of THC is in the student's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| system. And as it dissipates and is no longer there, you look for that consistency in clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| I think that's great. And I know all of us here would want to celebrate along with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| students around that recovery and sobriety and also those academic achievements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| I think it would be good to share with the board year over year some of that aggregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| information in terms of what are we seeing there in terms of specific, in terms of recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| and also the academic achievements. I think in general, we all know it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| I think it's also good to be able to specifically celebrate the achievement of those students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| who are battling a pretty tremendous barrier at the same time they're trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| accomplish things academically. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| All right. Thank you, Mr. Watson and Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=2996)|

| 0:50:06| I'm sorry. I do have a few questions tonight. On item F, specifically because we spoke about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| and this has to do with social and emotional learning, can someone speak to just the benefits of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| particular grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| Thank you. I'll pass to Mr. Myers, who may bring Ms. Cook up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| Thank you, Dr. Riesling. Yes, I think that Mrs. Cook is here, so I think that she'll be the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| knowledgeable person on the grant. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| So, to put this grant in perspective, we applied and received this grant a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3038)|
| 0:50:47| a couple of years ago, just as we went into COVID. It was a grant. At that point, we decided we were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| focus in on supporting suicide prevention in a number of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3052)|
| 0:51:00| We called it the Keeper Grant, and we did work in small groups in high schools and middle schools to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| provide support for students and teacher awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| So, this year, as we were applying for the grant, we were looking to broaden it out a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| We were looking to say, what is it, especially through COVID, that we need to look at to support the students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3080)|
| 0:51:28| And what we all know is that if students are not connected to their learning, connected to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| educational environment, they don't do as well academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| So, this grant is really about providing skill sets to a group of students, to six schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3099)|
| 0:51:49| We have leaders in the school. We have six students per school who are going to learn the skills to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| connect students that may be on the periphery, or to have conversations that are hard conversations with each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3115)|
| 0:52:08| other. It's not about changing people's minds about anything. This is about perspective building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| alliance, collaboration, education, and self-awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| So, these students, their remit for the year is that at the end of the year, they have to have gone through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| process with their leaders, and they're going to produce something for their schools, or something that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| use district-wide, that could build connection within the schools, within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| So, it's really about skill building. It's about how to have a dialogue, how to have difficult conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3163)|
| 0:52:57| people that you don't share the same perspective with, and it's really about creating a safe environment for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3177)|
| 0:53:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| Any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| Item G, under grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3204)|
| 0:53:32| Moving on to contract 7, discussion or questions on A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. Just a technical question. I'm not used to seeing two contracts in one item. Should this be two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| separate items? Is it two separate contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| Item A, since it's two different entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| You want me to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| Yes, procurement will send over more than one vendor if they're responding to the same RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3243)|
| 0:54:12| So that's what's happened here. That way the schools can use either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| I believe in this particular case it's because perhaps there's such a demand for interpreters that one company couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3257)|
| 0:54:26| handle the entire demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| I'm assuming it's a cap, so we're committing to $100,000. It's based on usage rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| It is a cap. I'd have to look back and see if it's per, but I was thinking it was just the one cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| So $100,000 total between both vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a question. I don't know if anybody can answer it or if it really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| But out of curiosity, are we talking about several languages, or is it most of the concentration in 90 to 95% of one language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3305)|
| 0:55:29| I don't have an exact number, but I can get it for you if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| We have a broad number of languages. Part of the reason we wanted to expand to have two contracts, and we also work with additional vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| This particular agreement is just with two entities, but we can also use other vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| The goal being to get our schools access to as many language options as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| We don't want to run into an instance where we have a rare dialect being spoken, and in a pinch we can't get access to an interpreter in a timely way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| So we're trying to cast a little bit of a broader net to make sure we do that, but there's a plethora of language need in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3359)|
| 0:56:12| Part of this decision also came from conversations with Bridge Refugee and Central Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| Again, that need to have access to interpreters so that we can be timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| Basically you've answered my question. If you run into, as you said, a rare dialect, it falls on them to find somebody that can interpret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3388)|
| 0:56:40| Yes, sir. We would issue a request, and whoever could provide that, that's who we would use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| Jim Hinton is here. I just want to make sure he has an opportunity to address us on the next one, on B, if he would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3413)|
| 0:57:02| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| So that was on item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| Any other discussion, questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| Or item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| Thank you, Madam Chair. This question is the same question. It's actually for item B and C, and that is, both of these have to do with additions for these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| Dr. Garfield, can you talk to us about what additional capacity this will bring to each of these schools, these additions, and how much we're currently over capacity in those schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| Yes, so the Hardin Valley Academy, you're looking at roughly 32 additional classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3464)|
| 0:57:55| Sturkey, you're looking at 10 additional classrooms. Hardin Valley, for the 2021 school year, ended the school year at over 138 percent currently. Well, that's 38 percent over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| But this school year, you're looking at 20 additional students. The last number we pulled was 2,128 students, opposed to the 2,108 students that Hardin Valley had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3481)|
| 0:58:20| So not a great change as far as classroom sizes, excuse me, as enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| However, we're still well over capacity. When you look at Sturkey Elementary, we were 107 percent over capacity, 7 percent over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3506)|
| 0:58:37| So they were over 22 students this year. Last year they were at 365. I'm sorry, last year they were at 343. This year we're at 365, 22 students over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3517)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you. I'm sure there's a lot of factors that go into when we start looking at building additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| But given the amount of percentage that we're currently over, is there kind of a threshold where we start looking at that, when we start saying we need to start looking at this for this particular school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3535)|
| 0:59:03| Well, I will tell you that the industry standard recommendation is for schools to be at 85 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| So obviously we're 100 over, we're probably too...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| Yeah, absolutely. And I will tell you, as a former high school principal, when you talk about classroom sizes, it really depends on your schedule, your master schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| There's some classes you have, or AP classes, and you'll be limited to 9 or 10 or possibly even 15 students, opposed to 25 or 30 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3560)|
| 0:59:32| So we would have to take some time to look at the actual standard for classroom sizes, and really dig into the master schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3572)|
| 0:59:41| So there's different formulas that we look at. This is looking at a combined of several different formulas of capacity, and what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| And basically the function of the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| One of the reasons I ask is one of the things that I hear a lot in the district from my principals in certain schools is talking about how much they feel like they're crowded, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| Like they're over capacity. And it's always hard going back to them, especially when they see additions being built in new schools, and they feel like they've had that same problem for 10 years or whatever, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3601)|
| 1:00:11| So I think the more educated we can be on kind of what are the things that end up causing that to rise to the level that we act, I think it's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3611)|
| 1:00:19| a good thing for us as board members to continue to be informed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3619)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to follow up with that and give a little background on why Sturkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| There are several elementary schools in that area that are over capacity, and Sturkey has something the others don't. They have land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3632)|
| 1:00:41| And so because they have so much land, it makes it easier there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3641)|
| 1:00:50| Okay, so item 7D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3650)|
| 1:01:01| Thank you. I had about 15 items in the middle that I didn't have a question about, so I just want to make that known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| So this is a pilot with Graphic Creations, and from my understanding, this is specifically for employees to be able to buy branded material with KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| What I'm trying to figure out is, will this also happen at the school level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3675)|
| 1:01:23| For instance, will somebody at Bearden High School now buy a Bearden High School cap if they're a teacher from this group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| And if so, have we thought about how this might impact the funds that schools are currently generating for these types of items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| And if this is a pilot, what's phase two to the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| Are we potentially looking at using this provider for also student access to branded material and that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3702)|
| 1:01:51| Dr. Reiswit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| I'll pass to Dr. Norton, and then she can pass to these two. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| Thank you, Dr. Reiswit, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| The pilot right now is just to provide a store for employees to purchase KCS gear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| We do not intend at this time to expand that to school-level gear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| Certainly that's something we can look at if there's a demand for that later, but we don't anticipate this taking any funds away from schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| It's also intended to remain an employee-only store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| But, Carly, if there's anything you want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| The main reason I thought to ask the question is because it was referenced as a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| There's always a next phase to a pilot, and I wanted to try to figure out what the trajectory was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| Regular agenda items. Item A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| Item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Thank you, Madam Chair. I actually had a question about Item B as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| Typically I don't have questions about line item adjustments, but the way I read this adjustment, it made me ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| because some of my schools have talked about the lack of personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| Is some of this being reallocated because of underspending in salary and benefits for this particular group of our personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| How are we doing on food service workers for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| It's a combination of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| Last year we fed more than 8,000 students a day because of the new law that was passed for all students to eat for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| That had a significant impact on our food costs, and that came out after we had already budgeted for that school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| Fortunately and unfortunately, we were able to absorb that cost because we had 50 vacancies last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3831)|
| 1:04:01| This year we have 30 vacancies in food services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| Last year we had 50 vacancies. This year we have 30 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| And I will tell you, Brett has done a phenomenal job with her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| Last year she spent little time in the office and her administrative team spent a lot of time in schools working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| That does create an issue at the central office level when you look at customer service for the entire district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| but they were able to do it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| This year we're in a much better place with only 30 vacancies, but we do need to fill those vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| But our numbers are more accurate this year because we're back to the normal cost that we budgeted for for the 2021 school year prior to the change in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3879)|
| 1:04:47| Anecdotally, have you all or Brett heard anything about the 15% increase that we gave this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| Has that helped any in trying to fill some of those vacancies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| I would say it has because we are up 20 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| But we're currently working really hard to recruit people, and Brett has done an exceptional job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| She's really good at advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| She takes care of that on her own and with her department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| If anyone's listening and you're interested, we would love to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| While we're talking about the nutrition department, she also does a fabulous job on social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| promoting the work that they do in our school cafeterias and all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3933)|
| 1:05:43| Hopefully, all the positive energy might help some with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| Item C, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| Thank you. I know we're starting with the collaborative conferencing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| Can somebody just remind the board of that timeline, mainly because when we were approving the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| we had a schedule study for the first time in 20 years, and I'm sure that these things will go hand-in-hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| Thank you, Mr. Watson, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| I'll say a couple of things about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| One, I see our friend Paula Hancock in the crowd, so we get to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| Last month, we talked through this a little bit, and I'll say a little bit about the Peckett team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| so the way that's set up is that is how we collaborate in conference with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| and for us, it's KCEA, the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| We've had a great relationship for a long time with them, and so this is really a setup for us and our Peckett collaborative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| conferencing where we meet once a month and kind of talk through the things for the next MOU that's coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| and everything from salaries and wages to grievance procedures, insurance, fringe benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| working conditions, leave, and payroll deductions are all things that are included in those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| that come to an MOU for you all when we meet monthly and kind of work through those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| So this item is for us to look at as we've done some reorganization, some different folks to be able to put on that team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| and I think, again, will come because of the timeline of things that are coming ahead in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| to have this team approved again for the new MOU that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, yes, the salary study, the team is preparing the language for the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| to put out for the salary study now, and we anticipate that when we receive those results back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| that may be something that goes to the collaborative conferencing team to consider in salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| but we don't, until we know what it says, we don't quite know how we're going to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| and who would have input into what portions are implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| Thank you. Can you remind us when the MOU would need to be enacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| Like, what's the timetable to have new things put in the MOU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| The MOU is good for up to a maximum of three years, and I believe the most recent one was entered into in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| so the new one would be signed in 2023. I believe it was 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| During the summer or early 2023?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| July of 2020 is when it was entered into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| So July 23. Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| All right, any more discussion on those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Mr. Watson, are you done with that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| One question about the salary schedule RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| What is the timeframe that you are expecting for them to have that work accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| I know you don't have the firm yet, but what is the timetable for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Ideally, prior to budget, but I don't know that that's going to be possible with the amount of time that the RFP process will take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| plus the amount of time it will take to actually do the salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| So ideally, before the budget, I don't know that that's going to be realistic, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| so we may be looking at planning for the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| Okay, so item D, reorganization of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| This is something that I think we decided to put on our work session agenda at a previous meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| so we could vote on it on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| So if anybody has any thoughts or discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| I think it's important for us to have this and to be able to have some intentional conversation in advance of our meeting where we vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| which will be at the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| For those who have watched the board for some time, you know in the past we used to have a short meeting before the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| Now it will happen in the context of the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| And Ms. Christie, I saw where, I think it was in the compass today, you mentioned that you would be willing to serve again if asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| I think given all the change that we've experienced in the district with the superintendent and also with three new board members in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| and a lot of that is very exciting, I also think for the board it would be good to have some consistency and leadership in the chair role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4231)|
| 1:10:39| And I appreciate you being willing to do that and would hope that you would be able to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| Obviously, we don't have somebody in the vice chair role, and so that's something that we need to be thoughtful and intentional about with Ms. Satterfield moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4244)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| So is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| Ms. Foy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| I agree with Mr. Watson. I think we have had a lot of change over the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| So I'm glad that you're willing to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| Over the last several years, we've had chairs continue for two terms, and I think that's been helpful and has contributed to smooth continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4281)|
| 1:11:31| So I appreciate that you're willing to do that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| Okay. So public forum. Ms. Kovner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| Thank you, Madam Chair. We have three registered speakers this evening, the first being Annabelle Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4308)|
| 1:11:56| And Ms. Henley, if you'll just state your name and county of residence for the record, and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| My name is Annabelle Henley. I live in Knox County. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| I also want to publicly thank Madam Chair for running such a positive campaign, and I'm looking forward to supporting this board and Knox County Schools as a member of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| So tonight I wanted to talk about the spending of the ESSER funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| And the current efforts appear to be well-researched and evidence-based and reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| And in normal times, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| But we seem to be a little detached from the reality in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| From all I'm hearing from teacher friends and other friends who work as support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| the problem is insufficient staffing, and I'm not seeing the staffing issues being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| A good analogy, I think, would be a parent who says, I'm not going to buy my kid any clothes this year because I have to save for college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4365)|
| 1:12:53| And we all know teachers who are being affected by these difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| I'm going to share a story from a teacher who wishes to remain anonymous, and we have another speaker who's going to share some other stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| But these come from elementary, middle, and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| The first story is, it's really bad at my school right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| Beside the normal sub shortages, we have several unfulfilled positions for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| A co-worker quit last month. Another was out with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| And because we don't have a long-term sub, we're doing all the work of our teammate who is sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| We sometimes have subs, but not every day. And I have to explain everything daily to the new sub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| So the kids aren't getting appropriate instruction or access to their technology in some classes for days at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| It's not sustainable. I can't do two people's jobs for an entire semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| I'm already trying to figure out what other options I have for employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| So from my own experience at the health department, we've been hiring educational assistants for clerical positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| We pay over $31,000 a year for those, which is way more than what they're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4438)|
| 1:14:06| Two of them recently hired were in CDC classrooms, and so they're experiencing much less job stress as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| Two of my friends with 15 years of experience have resigned over the summer, and a third just called to tell me she's leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| One of those is an educator of color who taught my son and was an incredible asset to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| I know it's a very difficult position for you all, and there's no easy answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| But we have to find a way to make our teachers and support staff feel valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| I remember when you were deciding on your compensation for our new superintendent, it was important to you to make sure you were offering a competitive salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| I think we need to use the same logic with our teachers and our support staff as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| The next speaker is Erin Keck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| Ms. Keck, if you'll state your name and county of residence, and you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| Thank you. My name is Erin Keck, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| Madam Chair and members of the board, I am sharing reports from three school staff members reflecting the critical staffing shortages in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4503)|
| 1:15:12| The first staff person said, at my school, we still need a regular ed teacher and a SPED teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| Our permanent sub and one instructional coach has been filling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| That means our permanent sub is not even available to cover any other classes if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| This is by far the worst year in comparison to even the virtual COVID years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| Special education is a complete disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| Due to the regional changes and several retirements last year, there is only one special education mentor per region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| There are new special education teachers in many schools who have limited, if any, access to a mentor teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| The mentor teachers are currently covering vacancies in buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| The SPED teachers have no idea how to do any of their paperwork, collect data, and even do basic functions of their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| These facilitators are essentially unavailable, and so the SPED teachers are lost already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| Finally, a staff member reports, I honestly do not want to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| There is no consistency in the school system for support of the educators or the whole staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| It seems that downtown wants things to go back pre-COVID, like test scores and teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| but we have to take into account that the students are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| We have to meet their emotional and physical needs before we can teach them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| but it is stretching the staff thin when we do not have enough to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| I urge you to make solving the immediate staffing problems in our schools the highest priority in ESSER and other funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| Lance McCold, Knox County. Madam Chair and members of the Board, thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4607)|
| 1:17:01| I think we have heard that our schools are in a staffing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| I want to say that I was really pleased with the way that Ms. Cook and Mr. Meyer are using the ESSER funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4626)|
| 1:17:16| They are using it to fund programs that our schools really need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| but I have to say that you cannot expect training in these programs to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| if you do not have staff to fill the basic positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| That seems to be where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| Teachers and support staff have long gone above and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| and the reports we are hearing are unsustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| I am very concerned that we are not hearing about this during these Board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| Worse still, our students and children are not getting the education they deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| because the staff are not available to do the job the way they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| We are asking far too much of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| Schools' wages are not keeping up. We cannot keep enough support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| Our schools do not have enough custodians, aides, substitutes, and other support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| This is a problem you know how to solve. Labor is a competitive market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| If you need lumber, you pay Home Depot what it costs to buy the lumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| If you need workers, you pay a competitive wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| Teachers and support staff can be solved by Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| That solution is clear. Pay the support staff a competitive salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| and lure them back from Target and other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| Paying teachers more is important, but what is driving teachers to quit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| from what I am hearing, is the working conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| Those working conditions can be quickly improved by hiring more support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| Imagine if there were enough custodians to keep the classrooms clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| without teachers having to clean their own rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| Imagine how much you could reduce teacher stress if there were enough aides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| so that no teacher had to work the bus lines or the cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| We don't have to imagine. We could pay custodians, aides, and other support staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| what it takes to hire them away from Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| Money, of course, is always a concern, but we have the money to pay competitive wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| In the long run, we have to pay a competitive wage. Let's do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| ESSER funds were sitting on $100 million for the pandemic and the fallout, and we are in the fallout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| Let's do it now. Let's solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| We've got the money. We've got an excuse to do it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| I just want to thank the public forum speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| and also share that I have a friend that is a teacher in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| She's been teaching for more than 15 years in Knox County Schools, and she also shared with me today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| that she cried in the middle of class because of how terrible it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| I know that this is definitely a problem that we need to address, but I think I've asked a few questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| about ESSER funds, and I'm still getting clear on all of that, but I wonder if there's someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| that can speak to how these are allowed to be spent and our restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4832)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| I'm probably not versed enough right now to speak to all of those, so I can give you kind of the overview of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| and then what's allowable probably through our finance department and Ron and talking to Cheryl Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| But overall, kind of big view of that, those were made available for a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| One was in the event the pandemic were to continue to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| for things like safe return to school as far as things like air filtration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4868)|
| 1:21:15| different types of equipment or things that might be used to make schools safer in that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| And then a large part of the other was learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| And so those were kind of the two big things that the dollars were put in for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| We did go through a process of talking to the community, talking within the areas that were laid out for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| for that to be put into, and then from there, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| created a plan with the community's input to draw those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| But we can make modifications to those dollars at different times, but there are pretty strict things that we can move those for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| So we could probably have, again, Mr. McPherson or Ms. Martin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| who's over at Federal Programs, come back at some point and maybe give a little more guidance on that than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| That's kind of the bigger part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| Thank you, Madam Chair. Dr. Roswick, I know we talked some about this conversation when we were first speaking about ESSER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| and you all were elaborating much more than because we had just gotten the guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| And I think one of the things that we talked about was salaries and how we can support our teachers and support staff and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| One of the things that we have to be careful of when it comes to our ESSER dollars is making sure that we don't create an intentional fiscal cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| And I think all of us would want to address that with those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| but I think that's one of the things that we've got to be really careful of is not creating a situation where we end up causing more harm than good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| So at the meeting today with Secretary Cardona and Dr. Biden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| one of the things that Secretary Cardona said that stuck out with me is he mentioned that the teacher shortage is a symptom of a lack of teacher respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4971)|
| 1:23:01| And that stuck with me, and I don't think that's reflective of us on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| I think we have respect for our teachers and our educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| but I think one of the things that we have to be thoughtful about as a community, as a state, as a country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| is that when we are entrusting educators to educate our children, part of that comes with some reciprocity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=4996)|
| 1:23:24| that we also have to trust them and respect them in doing that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| And I think the more that we can, as a board and as a district, continue to elevate our educators and our other professionals and our other people who are providing support in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5009)|
| 1:23:38| I think that will help bring people back to the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| I think that the problem that we're experiencing has not always been a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| and we have to be able to look ourselves in the mirror and ask, why are we experiencing this problem now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| And yes, pay is great. I don't know that ESSER funding is the way to fix that problem long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| but there's other things that we need to be doing and considering as a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| Sorry, I took a minute there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| I think part of the issue, if we're looking at working conditions, is not just the in-classroom working conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5053)|
| 1:24:22| but also all of the extra things that teachers have to do that cause them many hours beyond classroom time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| And if we are unable to use funds in a way that can compensate them for all of the things that we're asking them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5067)|
| 1:24:42| we need to be looking at what we can take off of their plates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| What things are we asking them to do that we really don't need to be asking them to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| I'd also say that district-wide, I've seen that it's not the same at every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| Some schools have a lot of extra things being put on teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| and other schools have a lot of autonomy for their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| And the feeling in those buildings is massively different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| When you walk into a building where everyone is expected to do the exact same thing at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5115)|
| 1:25:23| and be on the exact same page, everyone in the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| there's a feeling of stress in that building that you just really can't describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5128)|
| 1:25:36| And then when you walk in another building where here's our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| and here's what we're going to do, and we're going to help each other, it's such a different feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| And I think that the folks who are in those buildings where there are additional expectations being put on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5147)|
| 1:25:56| they are very, very frustrated. And I think that's where a lot of our losses are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| I'd really like to see what is being taken off teachers' plates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| I'd also like the community to know that I know Knox County Schools is reaching out and trying to find more teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| I know that we have people downtown who have been on the phone calling retired teachers and trying to fill positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| and that they're being told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| So I think we need to look at the positions that we are having difficulty filling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| and see if we can find some more creative ways to fill those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| Maybe not make it one full-time position, but make it two half-time positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| or four quarter-time positions, whatever we have to do to fill those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| Because we may have a lot of people out there who have an ability to work part of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| and I think we need to do whatever we can to fill our positions as well as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| And just briefly about the ESSER funds and speaking to what Mr. Watson was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| I think we were very intentional in how we were spending a lot of these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| in the sense that we realized they're non-recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| So if you invest a lot of money into positions, what's going to happen in two years when we don't have that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5240)|
| 1:27:31| And I think that's always something that we worry about, and all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| whenever we make these investments, we want it to be sustainable, whatever we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5257)|
| 1:27:45| All right, so moving on to Board Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| I just wanted to say that September is National Suicide Prevention Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| so I just wanted to remind everyone to be kind to everyone around you and to also be kind to your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| Thank you, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| I got to sub a couple of weeks ago in seventh grade science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| I got to meet a lovely snake, well, a couple of lovely snakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| One of them was just orange and white, actually, so that was great fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| And you're still available, right? Are you still available to sub?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| I will be happy to sub, but I will not sub in a classroom with snakes. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| I have to have a limit somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| I just want to remind our principals that we can do that, and I'll take the snake rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| I'm not going to touch them, but I can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| I am still available, but not with the snakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| So Ms. Bounds, I know, is in the room, and I'm sure enjoying retirement, so I'm wondering, why are you back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| But glad to see you again, and welcome to the new board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| And also thanks again to the district and to the state for the work around Grow Your Own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| We do know we have a teacher shortage, and I think this is a tremendous strategy to help provide some alternative pathways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| Real quick, for those who weren't there, I love that on the panel, I hate that I'm trying to guess this woman's age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| but she was probably late 50s, early 60s, and she's a first-year teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| So she's had another career and doing her thing, and through the Grow Your Own, she's like, hey, I'm going to teach and do this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| And then there was a high school senior on the panel who, for the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| has been investing in her own skills and ability to become a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| So I love that this program really broadens the net for those who we think would be in a teacher pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| and want to come into our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| So thanks so much for the district, John, and also for Penny and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| I just want to say that I'm so excited to do this and work with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| and please forgive me in getting acquainted with all of these procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5407)|

| 1:30:22| I just want to welcome our new board members as well. It seems like forever ago since we had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| It seems like it was so long ago, so welcome to our new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| Also for being a resource to me as I've started this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5438)|

| 1:30:48| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| Just a comment, and you may be aware of this, but the air show that was at the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| the person who was over the show was a graduate of Doyle High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5459)|
| 1:31:10| and he's trained numerous people, and it's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| I heard him talk quite a bit being interviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| and it was amazing some of the things that they had to do and go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| I just wanted to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| I did not know that, so thanks for the shout out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| So with that, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220912?start=5498)|
