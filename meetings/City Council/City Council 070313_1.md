| 2:29:16| that this council adopted says should remain residential and green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| And so I just appreciate the entrepreneurial spirit of these gentlemen and their willingness to take a gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8960)|
| 2:29:29| I don't feel compelled personally to try to do what turns out well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8969)|
| 2:29:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8978)|
| 2:29:39| The motion and second before us is to deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| All those in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8985)|
| 2:29:46| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| Seven ayes and two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| Did I hear all that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8995)|
| 2:29:56| I heard seven ayes and two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8996)|
| 2:29:59| I heard Peel and Brown right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| Yeah, I'll just comment on my no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| Because I've really thought about this a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| Stone is just a part of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9007)|
| 2:30:29| We finally learned a little lesson in West Hills a number of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| that we needed to determine what was a good transition from single family or from residential to other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9033)|
| 2:30:42| where a piece of property could be developed in a reasonable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| And so it just appears to me that this is a very low impact opportunity for developing this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9045)|
| 2:30:55| and having the unsightliness of it and some of the other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| that are often complicating having a piece of vacant land like that near a quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| So it just seemed to me like you had somebody there that was interested in trying to do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9065)|
| 2:31:11| And I realized that it was somewhat a gamble on their part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| but I couldn't help but appreciate their investment and their efforts in that little gamble to try to do something to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9075)|
| 2:31:24| and to take away something where it's going to be a property that's going to come before us before long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9084)|
| 2:31:31| in an area that's kind of in our district and that we share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| And it's where a lot of kids are just kind of hanging out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9095)|
| 2:31:39| because it's an area where it's very similar to this in topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| So I'm just kind of thinking about trying to take that away from maybe some of the areas where it's not a safe place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9103)|
| 2:31:52| and it's not a good thing next to some apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| It's so similar to what we're going to be looking at soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| Let me just say that I think that there's not precluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| the owners are not precluded from coming back at some point to MPC and to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9123)|
| 2:32:08| with working through some of these details that haven't been worked through yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9128)|
| 2:32:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| I think because that was denied, then the next motion is moved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9139)|

| 2:34:08| 12C is an emergency ordinance adopting a temporary 90-day moratorium upon issuance of new building permits in that portion of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| which is zoned C-7, accepting only those permits issued for the purpose of authorizing interior renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9255)|
| 2:34:21| requested by Councilmember Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9261)|
| 2:34:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| Councilmember Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| I just want to point out to Council this is just a short-term moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9266)|
| 2:34:29| And Mr. Donaldson may or may not feel like it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| If Council wants to hear from him, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| But the idea is to get this Council a chance to do two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9275)|
| 2:34:41| based on what MPC puts together, to respond to what MPC staff puts together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| and the commissioners act on, hopefully, interim guidelines for the C-7 district upgrading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9287)|
| 2:34:55| C-7 district now has guidelines, but they do not reflect the new Cumberland Avenue plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| And so interim guidelines that will reflect that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| and address it that would come back before MPC and this Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| until such time as the recommended form-based zoning could be processed through the public process, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9309)|
| 2:35:17| and go before MPC and Council, which could take several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| But I believe, Mr. Donaldson, that you think that you can get the interim zoning amendments through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| and to this Council, if MPC approves them, within the 90-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| He answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| I just wanted to know if he could do it in 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| Anybody else have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| Mr. Danstroth signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| Does anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| Give me 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| Basically, right now, the C-7 Design Review Board is in a really tough position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| We have very limited purview when it comes to looking at new developments that are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| And we're in a situation in which we want to see development happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9360)|
| 2:36:05| but at the same time we want to make sure that it's going to be positive for the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9365)|
| 2:36:09| And so with this moratorium and interim design guidelines put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| you'll make the job of the C-7 Design Review Board that much easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| until a full-scale design of the area can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9381)|
| 2:36:22| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| I just want to point out that you can wave to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| Debbie Billings is also in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9385)|
| 2:36:26| She wrote a short but articulate e-mail to council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| I think you all remember getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| Any other questions then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9396)|
| 2:36:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9397)|
| 2:36:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9398)|
| 2:36:39| We have three folks signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| I want to remind everyone that we have a five-minute time limit, which we will strictly observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| First is Charles Jetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| We appreciate all of you waiting through our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9411)|
| 2:36:53| Charles Jetter, 3624 Rockford Street, Rockford, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9413)|
| 2:36:57| I own and operate Gus's Restaurant, located on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9417)|
| 2:37:02| I've been there since 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| Previous to that, we were at 506 Gay Street until I believe it was the county decided to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| they thought they were going to be able to jail there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| So we moved up to Market Square and enjoyed all the renovations there and the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9434)|
| 2:37:22| I have a document here that I signed that the city council has given me permission to build a fence in front of the restaurant for dining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9442)|
| 2:37:30| And this was signed, I guess, September of 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| I never built the fence until just here a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| And after I built the fence, I was told by a gentleman from the City of Knoxville Engineering –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9457)|
| 2:37:43| I think department is his department – David Brace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| and told me that a Coke machine that's located on the corner of Wall and Market Square –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9466)|
| 2:37:54| it's been there for 25 years, this Coke machine's been sitting there for 25 years since the Peroles has had that restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9474)|
| 2:38:00| Mr. David Brace told me he wanted me to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| And he said that because of this lease that I have, I guess is the reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9483)|
| 2:38:08| I look through this lease and I really don't see anything that demands that I move the Coke machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9488)|
| 2:38:15| other than it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9495)|
| 2:38:18| use of the outdoor dining area shall be prohibited the placement of any permanent fixtures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9498)|
| 2:38:27| Well, I did not place that machine there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| and I don't think you could consider a Coke machine a permanent fixture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| because it probably could be moved by someone pretty easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| And I guess I'm asking city council to look at this and see if I could indeed be allowed to keep this Coke machine here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9516)|
| 2:38:43| I don't think it provides any imminent threat to anything in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9523)|
| 2:38:48| And also there is another statement that he told me that he didn't want me cooking anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9528)|
| 2:38:53| I have a little grill that occasionally will cook a few hamburgers there that are quite good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| Some of you folks, I think, have eaten them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| And whenever we have a festival, I guess it's okay to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9541)|
| 2:39:04| but if there's not something that's deemed by the city or someone to be a festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| then I can't cook hamburgers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| So maybe my two requests is that I'd be allowed to cook a hamburger when I want to occasionally there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9551)|
| 2:39:18| and also that I can keep my Coke machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| And I don't know the process that I would need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| I think you'd have to go back through, Bill, you might help me with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| I'd still have to come back through our codes folks to make sure that that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| I don't think that's an issue for council unless they want to change some rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| And it's also just the conditions of those sidewalk leases and what are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| And it gets into the market square plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| So there are a few controlling documents there that would have to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| Don't forget to check the downtown design guidelines also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9588)|
| 2:39:57| That would have been much funnier had I said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| Mr. Jetter, we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| We don't mean to blow off in coming for the commission or coming for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| But I think it is the appropriate is to work with the codes folks to see what's appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9607)|
| 2:40:15| And then also I think there's some sidewalk leases that are applicable in the market square district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9615)|
| 2:40:20| So who would I talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| Give me a phone number of somebody I can talk to to get going on this so that Mr. Brace doesn't pull my Coke machine out tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9621)|
| 2:40:30| I mean, I think one thing that I think some of us will ask David Brace what's happening is a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9630)|
| 2:40:38| I mean, if I were in the street, I'd actually say Madeleine Weil would be the person to holler at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9638)|
| 2:40:45| Madeleine Weil would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| She's right back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9647)|
| 2:40:52| No, she's right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| And she can give you a phone number and you can talk to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| Alonzo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9659)|
| 2:41:00| Councilman Bailey just said that you actually referred to us as the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9660)|
| 2:41:05| You might have opposition now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9665)|
| 2:41:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| You're not having enough fun, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| Apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9671)|
| 2:41:12| It's way past my bedtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| Alonzo Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9676)|
| 2:41:17| I filibustered two hours about something everybody would agree on anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| Y'all getting about like county commission slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9682)|
| 2:41:26| Alonzo Montgomery, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| Mr. Mayor, you owe me three extra minutes because I didn't show up two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9688)|
| 2:41:34| UT game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| I honored that, so I want my three extra minutes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9695)|
| 2:41:40| Really, I deserve ten, but since it's been a late day for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| and I've been filibustering county commission to go up under you all's format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9703)|
| 2:41:49| and start having commission meetings at 6 o'clock in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| And, man, have I been pushing your name, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| because I respect you because you'll come up if you get in here early in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9717)|
| 2:42:02| and you'll stay here until 10 o'clock at night until the last citizen is heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| And that's what I've been pushing on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| If this body right here can do it, they can do it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| Let's do away with that 2 o'clock agenda thing of being home by 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| eating your meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9736)|
| 2:42:17| I'm tired of hearing that junk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| Time for county commission to get on board with city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| and represent the people of Knoxville, point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| And when I speak before a governmental meeting on a Monday morning, buddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| they're going to hear it, and they're going to change that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| because you hear Commissioner Scott Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| oh, we've been doing it like that all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| Well, man, change is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| And we're a younger generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| Look here, all those old guys, they gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| They gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| So young folk, we ought to have a different mindset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| We ought to be one to really serve the people, Councilman Brown, and we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| Them boys don't have no business even having a meeting on the fourth Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| of every Monday at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| Because everybody in their audience is county employees, the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| Fifteen out of the 19 working in the county commission in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| all they got to do is come downstairs to commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| They have lost their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| And then Joe that wants to get up here and speak his mind, don't get off the 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| He can never be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| What kind of governmental body is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| Ronald Reagan would probably roll over in his grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| He said the government belongs to the people and not the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9806)|
| 2:43:31| But, Mr. Mayor, my last four minutes, I read in the paper yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| Alvin Nance, you, Dr. Lyons, all you guys wanting to turn down Walter P. Taylor homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| I don't have a big problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| But I want you all to sort of take a look at Weston Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| Weston Heights is, you know, I hear the mayor say he's for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| He's for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9831)|
| 2:43:52| Man, I want you all to put up and shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| Weston Heights is an eyesore in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| Anybody ride through Weston Heights, you think crime is bad in Walter P. Taylor homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| I've heard of more carjackings and more shootings in Weston Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| than I ever heard of in Walter P. Taylor homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9846)|
| 2:44:12| Those projects over there, they need to tear them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| If they're not going to do anything with them, they need to tear them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| They need to get a ball, Mr. Mayor, and go through Weston Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| Man, that's an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9864)|
| 2:44:25| Excuse me for calling you a man, Mr. Mayor, but that's an eyesore on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| I have a problem with the industrial board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| I have a problem with them, and they're representing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| I've been up there and seen these women many a days, and they know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| and poor resolutions and amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| Man, I could go through 15, 20 resolutions that IDB has dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9880)|
| 2:44:45| and I could right now go to my car and get them if we had the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| and I could pinpoint problems where some people other than I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| would come inside this town and ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| I don't have a BS degree, but I've got some colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| but I've got a whole lot of military time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| and the main thing, I've got a whole lot of faith and a whole lot of common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| I could pick it, and I could scrutinize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| and no one on this panel would be able to stand wind to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9911)|
| 2:45:15| Then the second thing, I've got a problem with, you know, if they want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| you're going to take those, turn those 530 units down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| What are you going to do, put the people right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9922)|
| 2:45:25| just disperse them like they did in college homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| Half of them still don't have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| Twenty more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| Give me three minutes, Mr. Hall, because I deserve my three minutes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9932)|
| 2:45:38| Mr. Hall, Mr. Hall moved for three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| Mr. Becker is nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| Hey, look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| I've got a good one for you before I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| We're going to talk about these issues more and more as they go and come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| I've got a thing with Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| When Mayor Ash was here, I loved when he took, what's his name, Ingram, and cut him off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9953)|
| 2:46:03| cut Chamber of Commerce, took that $400,000 away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| Mr. Mayor, y'all got $137,000 going over to that guy, Randy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| that was the finance guy for Mayor Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| He don't deserve that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| That's taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| Even though I know you're not accepting the salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| he still don't deserve that money to go over to a Chamber of Commerce to pay him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9981)|
| 2:46:26| I called over there, and, man, I got every resolution y'all have gave them money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9986)|
| 2:46:31| I've read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9991)|
| 2:46:32| I've looked at jobs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9992)|
| 2:46:33| Jobs now sucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| I'm not a white guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9996)|
| 2:46:37| I'm black, but I'm not stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| And I know it's a good old boy network, but jobs now sucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=9999)|
| 2:46:44| The guy sent me on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| I went on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10006)|
| 2:46:47| There's nothing on their website that commends them to get $537,000 from the city of Knoxville every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10007)|
| 2:46:54| and then another $545,000 from a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10014)|
| 2:46:59| I asked the guy in finance about the $145,000 because they got it broke down twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| I said, now, what's going on with this $145,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| And the guy in finance, in the county finance, couldn't even give me an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10028)|
| 2:47:14| So y'all finna go back into budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| I know it's a good old boy system, but if Cornerstone Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10037)|
| 2:47:21| I remember when Mayor Randville offered the gentleman at Cornerstone Foundation $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10041)|
| 2:47:26| that gentleman told him he didn't want it, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| He said, we can go out here and we raise our own money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10048)|
| 2:47:31| If Chamber of Commerce got all these businesses a member, they're getting a whole lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10051)|
| 2:47:37| I've been back home 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| I've watched them boys move three times, Mr. Mayor, on taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| Three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| They left there about a coliseum, sold the building for $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| Montgomery knows these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| Then they moved over into Old City Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| Then when we start renovating uptown and trying to get Market Square going and make Knoxville bloom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10074)|
| 2:48:00| you know what they did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10080)|
| 2:48:01| They moved out there and moved in prime real estate right there on the doggone square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| Now you tell me they're not abusing taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| I'll be back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10089)|
| 2:48:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10090)|
| 2:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10091)|
| 2:48:12| Jeff Tallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| Thank you, Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| Jeff Tallman, 1101 Luttrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| And I had the opportunity to go to KCDC-hosted forum this past, actually the previous week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10099)|
| 2:48:25| on the I-275 North Knoxville Urban Redevelopment Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| I just wanted to report to you my unqualified enthusiasm and excitement for what that represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10109)|
| 2:48:35| It's really very, very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| I want to appreciate MPC and Mark's staff time investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| I'm sure City and Dr. Lyons and your commitment and the good folks, staff and board members at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10121)|
| 2:48:50| It really is very, very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| And if we keep this up, we're going to have a real city on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| One of the things in looking at that was there was a comment about an aggressive look at the dereliction of property ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10136)|
| 2:49:03| that we are overrepresented with in our center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| And people who have back tax obligations that mean that their business approach going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10147)|
| 2:49:16| is basically just to let the property sit and rot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10156)|
| 2:49:21| I would suggest that that's something that we have a – it's a timely discussion in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10161)|
| 2:49:27| that we have a more sophisticated discussion about eminent domain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| and the rights and duties that come with property ownership in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10171)|
| 2:49:36| The conflagration just passed on Jackson Avenue, I think, is a timely – brings this situation to the fore in our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10176)|
| 2:49:48| We all have the right to own property, but those are not absolute rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| The property owner who owned most of the properties that were consumed by the fire on Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10193)|
| 2:50:01| became the poster child for a group in the community who sought to demagogue the issue of property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10201)|
| 2:50:07| And so the property owner – I guess it's sort of one of those things only in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10207)|
| 2:50:14| where you can be a champion for property rights with your hand out for the public dollar on the other hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10214)|
| 2:50:21| The property rights discussion needs to fairly ask, what rights does Ernie Gross have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10221)|
| 2:50:29| Because I think that man has property rights, and I think John Sanders, who was sitting here earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| and had his property put in peril across the street, has property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| And the reality is the – I think we need to have a – maybe it's an election year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10237)|
| 2:50:43| but this is a good time to have a more sophisticated discussion because you have the right to own your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10243)|
| 2:50:49| You do not have the right to set it on fire and burn your neighbor's property down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10249)|
| 2:50:53| And hopefully we can move that discussion back to a – what I'll call a common sense standard in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10253)|
| 2:51:01| We have the right to marry who we want, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| Yes, but you can't marry your sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| And the point is that those – we have duties that come with those rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10266)|
| 2:51:12| Just the discussion that preceded with respect to the downtown guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10272)|
| 2:51:18| I served on the nine-county-one vision downtown design guideline task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| and I want to say thank you, Mayor and your administration, for maintaining the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10283)|
| 2:51:29| and maintaining the continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| And I'm not commenting on the specific merits of that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| but just thank you for making good on that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10294)|
| 2:51:38| The discussion, to some extent, has been that George Crandall and Donna Ramble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10298)|
| 2:51:43| as if the other – that this was brought in from outside, and I want to correct the record on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10303)|
| 2:51:49| The reality is the downtown design guideline was a distillation of thousands of people's input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10309)|
| 2:51:55| who are citizens of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| It was not Don and George who basically imposed that on this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10317)|
| 2:52:01| That was the voice of the citizens of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10321)|
| 2:52:04| So in ratification of the vote that occurred tonight and your follow-through, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10324)|
| 2:52:09| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10329)|
| 2:52:10| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10330)|
| 2:52:11| That being said, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=10331)|
