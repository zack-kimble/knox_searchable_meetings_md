|  504.74 |  510.74 | As your commission is aware, Ms. Patel was cited at the end of June for a sale to a minor                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=504.74)  |

|  521.74 |  525.74 | If the Sheriff's Office would like to go first.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=521.74)  |
|  525.74 |  528.74 | We'll make that happen.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=525.74)  |

|  531.74 |  533.74 | That's no problem.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=531.74)  |
|  533.74 |  539.74 | The way we usually handle these is you stated your name and the business address,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=533.74)  |
|  539.74 |  547.74 | and the Sheriff will give his statement as to what happened with regard to the sale.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=539.74)  |
|  547.74 |  549.74 | You then can admit or deny that.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=547.74)  |
|  549.74 |  555.74 | And if you admit it, then you will have a chance to have your say to this board.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=549.74)  |

|  611.74 |  613.74 | She absolutely acknowledges that.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=611.74)  |
|  613.74 |  616.74 | And in the interim, she has completed an additional TABC course.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=613.74)  |
|  616.74 |  619.74 | I have that certificate, if the chair would like it.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=616.74)  |
|  619.74 |  623.74 | And so she has tried to take this as a learning opportunity that,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=619.74)  |
|  623.74 |  627.74 | regardless of how busy that store is, she absolutely needs to slow down,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=623.74)  |
|  627.74 |  630.74 | make sure that every single digit is checked and double-checked,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=627.74)  |
|  630.74 |  633.74 | especially when we have a card that does not scan.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=630.74)  |
|  633.74 |  637.74 | And so those are the circumstances we'd ask this commission to consider.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=633.74)  |
|  637.74 |  640.74 | She is very grateful that that store is doing well,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=637.74)  |
|  640.74 |  644.74 | but obviously that comes with the tremendous responsibility of carrying that permit.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=640.74)  |
|  644.74 |  648.74 | She understands that, and so we are before this body asking for some consideration                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=644.74)  |
|  648.74 |  651.74 | to allow her to continue to operate.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=648.74)  |
|  651.74 |  654.74 | And like I said, I can provide that additional TABC card that she received last week,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=651.74)  |
|  654.74 |  656.74 | if that would be helpful.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=654.74)  |

|  665.74 |  668.74 | Is Ms. Patel aware that in the state of Tennessee,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=665.74)  |
|  668.74 |  674.74 | that if you're under 21 years of age, the driver's license looks like this?                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=668.74)  |
|  674.74 |  677.74 | If you're over 21, it's this way.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=674.74)  |
|  677.74 |  683.74 | The state did that to make it easy for store owners.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=677.74)  |
|  683.74 |  685.74 | They made it idiot-proof.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=683.74)  |
|  685.74 |  688.74 | Is she aware that if it comes in like this to not ever sell beer,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=685.74)  |
|  688.74 |  690.74 | you don't even need to scan it?                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=688.74)  |
|  690.74 |  695.74 | Is she aware of that, plus there's also a red bar across it as well?                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=690.74)  |
|  695.74 |  697.74 | She is aware of those things, Commissioner,                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=695.74)  |
|  697.74 |  701.74 | and she is now duly informed as to taking that secondary class.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=697.74)  |
|  701.74 |  704.74 | And I will say that she came to this country legally.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=701.74)  |
|  704.74 |  706.74 | English is her second language,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=704.74)  |
|  706.74 |  712.74 | and so unfortunately there are some times where her language barrier is not to her benefit,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=706.74)  |
|  712.74 |  715.74 | and I think that may have been one that it was helpful for her to hear                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=712.74)  |
|  715.74 |  719.74 | all of those explanations a second time through her second course that she took                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=715.74)  |
|  719.74 |  722.74 | so that she duly understood that that is the easy,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=719.74)  |
|  722.74 |  726.74 | no-nonsense way to make sure that this does not happen again.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=722.74)  |
|  726.74 |  727.74 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=726.74)  |
|  727.74 |  730.74 | And then the other thing is when we issue a beer permit                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=727.74)  |
|  730.74 |  734.74 | and then they violate it nine days later, I mean,                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=730.74)  |
|  734.74 |  737.74 | the community finds that unacceptable.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=734.74)  |

|  771.74 |  774.74 | Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=771.74)  |
|  774.74 |  780.74 | I do commend Ms. Patel for operating a business in the 8th District.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=774.74)  |

|  783.74 |  787.74 | However, I do echo my colleague's concerns about the nine days,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=783.74)  |
|  787.74 |  793.74 | and I think it is true the community would be quite disappointed in that.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=787.74)  |
|  793.74 |  796.74 | And in keeping with our protocol,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=793.74)  |
|  796.74 |  804.74 | I am going to offer a motion that we follow our precedent on first offenses.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=796.74)  |
|  804.74 |  810.74 | However, if there is a second offense, especially in a short period of time,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=804.74)  |
|  810.74 |  817.74 | I don't think this body will be disposed to be quite as lenient as we normally would.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=810.74)  |
|  817.74 |  819.74 | Maybe lenient is not the right word,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=817.74)  |
|  819.74 |  823.74 | but we might have to break precedent if a second offense occurs too short a time.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=819.74)  |
|  823.74 |  829.74 | So I will offer a motion that we impose a 30-day suspension of the beer license                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=823.74)  |
|  829.74 |  835.74 | or a $1,000 fine, whichever the owner would prefer.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=829.74)  |
|  835.74 |  838.74 | Ms. Patel would appreciate the Commission's leniency                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=835.74)  |

|  841.74 |  843.74 | She'd be happy to pay that fine.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=841.74)  |
|  843.74 |  845.74 | So my motion, Madam Chair, is a $1,000 fine.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=843.74)  |

| 1326.74 | 1331.74 | So we might need to take this discussion up next month.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1326.74) |
| 1331.74 | 1334.74 | We can't hold, even though I don't drink beer                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1331.74) |
| 1334.74 | 1338.74 | and I wish it was never invented as far as I'm concerned,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1334.74) |
| 1338.74 | 1343.74 | but we cannot hold up a business from being sold or opened                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1338.74) |
| 1344.74 | 1349.74 | because the state of Tennessee don't want to go and do a health inspection.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1344.74) |
| 1349.74 | 1353.74 | I agree with that, and I don't know why it got turned away                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1349.74) |
| 1353.74 | 1357.74 | from the health department to the state.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1353.74) |
| 1357.74 | 1361.74 | Because as soon as you get the bureaucracy of the state, you're exactly right,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1357.74) |
| 1361.74 | 1366.74 | and it's not fair in my opinion.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1361.74) |
| 1366.74 | 1369.74 | I don't know why we can't get it back with the health department                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1366.74) |
| 1369.74 | 1376.74 | because they can act as they used to do and sit down there and say yea or nay.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1369.74) |
| 1376.74 | 1378.74 | I don't know the answer and how to get around that,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1376.74) |
| 1378.74 | 1383.74 | and I don't know why it got transferred to the state.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1378.74) |
| 1383.74 | 1391.74 | Anything to do with the state is just bureaucratic mess.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1383.74) |

| 1399.74 | 1404.74 | In other words, the state of Tennessee allowed the Knox County Health Department                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1399.74) |
| 1404.74 | 1407.74 | to do their inspections for them under a contract,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1404.74) |
| 1407.74 | 1410.74 | but we were the only county in Tennessee that did it,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1407.74) |
| 1410.74 | 1414.74 | and that's why they took it back over under their wings.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1410.74) |

| 1431.74 | 1435.74 | I have a question for Mr. Daly.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1431.74) |
| 1435.74 | 1439.74 | Mr. Daly, do you have a suggestion or a recommendation?                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1435.74) |
| 1439.74 | 1442.74 | Well, Mr. Moyer said that we could go ahead if that comes up again.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1439.74) |
| 1442.74 | 1447.74 | He thinks that we, according to our ordinance, we can't approve the beer permit,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1442.74) |
| 1447.74 | 1451.74 | and it's up to the state to go out and do the inspection.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1447.74) |
| 1451.74 | 1456.74 | If we approve the beer permit, the sale can go through.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1451.74) |

| 1461.74 | 1466.74 | if the sale goes through and inspection fails, it's on the new owner.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1461.74) |

| 1468.74 | 1473.74 | It's up to him to repair or whatever they've got to do at that point in time.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1468.74) |
| 1473.74 | 1479.74 | But they're not going to close on the sale without that permit.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1473.74) |

| 1482.74 | 1484.74 | I can understand why.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1482.74) |
| 1484.74 | 1489.74 | I wouldn't want to buy a piece of property that is now selling beer                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1484.74) |

| 1496.74 | 1500.74 | I need to know that up front, and that's only fair.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1496.74) |
| 1500.74 | 1503.74 | All right. Mr. Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1500.74) |
| 1503.74 | 1504.74 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1503.74) |
| 1504.74 | 1510.74 | So, in other words, it was a contingency sale.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1504.74) |
| 1510.74 | 1514.74 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1510.74) |
| 1514.74 | 1518.74 | But if we issue a beer permit to somebody,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1514.74) |
| 1518.74 | 1522.74 | is it the state doesn't want to come out until they actually own that property?                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1518.74) |
| 1522.74 | 1523.74 | Yep, that's what we were told.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1522.74) |
| 1523.74 | 1524.74 | That's what it is.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1523.74) |
| 1524.74 | 1525.74 | They have to own the property.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1524.74) |
| 1525.74 | 1526.74 | Yeah, I can see that.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1525.74) |
| 1526.74 | 1527.74 | I can see that.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1526.74) |
| 1527.74 | 1530.74 | I don't know if the chair's office knows anything or probably not.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1527.74) |
| 1530.74 | 1532.74 | Yeah, that's what I was told.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1530.74) |
| 1532.74 | 1535.74 | That's what Mr. Moyers is looking into.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1532.74) |
| 1535.74 | 1539.74 | And it sounds like if we can get it back, we're better off.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1535.74) |
| 1539.74 | 1540.74 | And it's confusing.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1539.74) |
| 1540.74 | 1543.74 | You know, does the state do convenience stores that sell food,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1540.74) |
| 1543.74 | 1548.74 | or health department does restaurants, or, you know, which is which?                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1543.74) |
| 1548.74 | 1550.74 | And who determines which is which?                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1548.74) |
| 1550.74 | 1553.74 | It's confusing.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1550.74) |
| 1553.74 | 1557.74 | Yeah, because the state can't then issue it to the former owner                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1553.74) |
| 1557.74 | 1559.74 | and then have that transferred, I don't think.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1557.74) |
| 1559.74 | 1562.74 | Because that's the problem.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1559.74) |
| 1562.74 | 1565.74 | The health department still goes in,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1562.74) |

| 1569.74 | 1573.74 | I mean, there's no question about that.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1569.74) |
| 1573.74 | 1578.74 | They can pass or not pass or close down an eating establishment.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1573.74) |
| 1578.74 | 1581.74 | That's strictly within the county.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1578.74) |
| 1581.74 | 1584.74 | Madam Chair, I suggest you put that on the agenda next month.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1581.74) |
| 1584.74 | 1589.74 | We'll have Mr. Moyers, the law director, tends to research and see what we can do.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1584.74) |
| 1589.74 | 1592.74 | But we can't hold a business up.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1589.74) |

| 1598.74 | 1602.74 | and so he is aware that this is information that we will be looking for.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board-b?start=1598.74) |
