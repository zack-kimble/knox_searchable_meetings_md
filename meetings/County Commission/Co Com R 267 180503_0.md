| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| The budget has about a total of $35 million for the employer's share of insurance in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=30)|
| 0:00:37| Then there was also a TCRS increase, Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| The legacy plan, which is the plan most of our teachers are on, a couple of years ago it changed to a different type plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| But most of our employees are on the, certified employees, are on the legacy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| So there was a slight increase there and a slight increase because there are so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=53)|
| 0:00:59| It is $2.1 million, the cost of that increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| So $2.1 million for Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| And as you know, we're opening up two new middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| So the projected, the incremental cost or the additional cost for both middle schools, $4.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=73)|
| 0:01:22| And we have, in our transportation department with our bus contractors, made an arrangement with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| that we would do a million dollar increase over a three year period for our contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| The margin of operation has shrunk down pretty drastically for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| So this will be the third year of a million dollar increase for our contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| And then there's about another $200 due to some bail changes at two of our schools and a little bit of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| So transportation was about $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| Emerald Academy is, they're increasing by two grade levels, so about 125 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=115)|
| 0:02:04| So $1 million would be the flow through money for Emerald Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| And one thing we did early on in this budget was with our teachers who teach at our priority and CUSP schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=130)|
| 0:02:18| And let me identify what a CUSP school is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| A CUSP school is a school that's in the bottom 10% in terms of academic achievement, bottom 10% in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=141)|
| 0:02:30| And we certainly have to submit a plan to the state, work with the state on what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| to try to increase the academic achievement at our CUSP schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| We want to increase it at all schools, but in particular our CUSP schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| because if you fall down in the 5% range and lower, then you're in danger of state takeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| So you would become a member of, rather than Knox County School, it would be an achievement school district school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| So we don't want any schools in the bottom 10, bottom 20, bottom 30, bottom 40 if we can help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| So we set aside approximately $910,000 to extend teacher contracts in our CUSP schools because, again, there's quite a bit of turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=182)|
| 0:03:14| Teaching is difficult work in any school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| But in some of our schools where the students are more at risk, it's a very difficult job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| So the turnover sometimes is pretty drastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| You lose that consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Also, we want to make sure that we try to do everything to get our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| We want best teachers everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| But we also want to try to make sure we keep our best teachers at our schools where the work is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| And as I said, it's difficult everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| So those extended contracts for the teachers, again, about $900,000, $910,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| Some of the schools will use that for staff development, for teachers, for their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| And some will use it for an extended day for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| But we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Dr. Ryzwick's working with and his staff working with the principals to make sure that we are doing the things that we think will move the school forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=240)|
| 0:04:09| So those increases right there around $14.2 million, and that's before we've done anything else, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=249)|
| 0:04:19| So the only options we would have had, basically, out of that group, out of those items identified, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| we wouldn't have to increase the length of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| But, again, to get teachers to give them some incentive to work in those schools to earn a little bit more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=269)|
| 0:04:38| And then the transportation, of course, is not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| But, again, we did a gentleman's agreement, I guess, in terms with our contractors, so for that increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| So once we receive the additional revenue from the state, what are recommended, presented to the board the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=289)|
| 0:04:58| Monday night, was a budget of $484,530,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| And that is within the current revenue projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Again, working with Chris and working with the state in terms of revenue, it is within the projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=308)|
| 0:05:17| And there were, as you might determine from what I've said, several significant challenges with balancing this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=317)|
| 0:05:25| But even so, I still believe that we will work towards increasing student achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| and eliminating disparities within this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| And just to recap what is in that recommendation to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| in the initial recommendation there was not funding for Project GRAD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| but worked with Project GRAD and worked with Ronnie Chandler, who is the executive director of Project GRAD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| and also Stephanie Welch, who is president of the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| And looking at what would it cost to fund the work that they do in two of our high schools, Austin East and Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=358)|
| 0:06:08| And where there was a million, roughly a million and $40,000 in the budget for the current year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| Project GRAD came back and said, we will do the work in the two high schools for $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=374)|
| 0:06:24| However, just know that that is not the true cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| What they are providing in the two high schools is more along the lines of $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| So they agreed that it would take some fundraising on their part to make up that difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| If this is the way that it ends up, they would have to raise an additional $200,000 in order to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=399)|
| 0:06:48| And they said, along with that, if we continue after this next year, just know if the board renews the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| that it would at a minimum need to be $700,000 to provide these services for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=415)|
| 0:07:05| Again, I talked about this a minute ago, but those teacher contracts that we extended, roughly $910,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| Also in this budget, placing a full-time reading facilitator at three of our CUSP elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| That's Lawnsdale Green and Syramore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| And in addition to that, the equivalent funding for three educational assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| And that was within the recommended budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| And that would cost approximately $500,000 to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| Then, as I mentioned a minute ago, continue with the funding for the incremental cost for Gibbs and Hardin Valley, $4.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| Gibbs is roughly $1.7 million of that, and Hardin Valley is roughly about $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| Then, as I mentioned, meeting our commitment toward increased expenditures for health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| and in the mandatory contribution rate for TCRS, $6.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| Then our transportation commitment, $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| Then Emerald Charter, $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| And then we also set aside what was not in the previous recommendation was an allocation for magnet schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| So what we did is restored that allocation in current years, $320,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| We set aside $160,000 for this next year for that allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| And principals would have to apply for that through Dr. Roswick's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| It's just to ensure that those funds are being used in a way that benefits students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| Then there's also within this recommendation $330,000 to comply with a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| This was not in the earlier version, but the state board, and we kind of missed this because I think it happened in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| but the state board has passed a ruling, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| that we have to put adult monitors on buses that transport students or kids six weeks to pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| So we've estimated that to cost about $330,000 for this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| And so you can see that the items I just talked about represents an increase of about $15.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| The projected revenue increase, $13.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| So we tried to, as best we could, preserve the spending in our classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| and we tried to minimize the impact of staffing reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| There will be some reductions, but we tried to minimize that as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| We've reallocated funds that will allow us to increase spending in our schools with the most need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| And in looking at that, when we look at the 14 schools that are in the most need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| we're spending this year about $6 million in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| Next year, this budget would spend about $6.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| That's over and above the staffing formula that we use for other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| So, again, keeping those teacher-pupil ratios low and trying to provide more resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| so that we can improve the academic achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| And one very important omission in this budget, not purposely omitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| but the funding with the limitations is a salary increase for our certified and classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=622)|
| 0:10:30| They will get a step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Those that are entitled to a step, there's roughly 20 steps, I think, in the certified scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| and maybe 14 steps in most of the classified scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| So those employees who are eligible for a step increase will get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| but the employees who are topped out in this budget would not get a raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| and there's not an overall raise in addition to the step raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| And just to tell you what that looks like, a 1% raise for certified employees costs about $2.3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| and for classified, $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And the board had a discussion about raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| and also restoring magnet school funding and project grad funding, and looking at all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| there was discussion about presenting a budget greater than the one that we actually submitted to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| but that motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| But I think it's important because what we've tried to do over the last few years is raise teacher salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| and we need to do more with that because some of these smaller districts are able to cherry-pick our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| come in and take our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| So we do need to improve our teacher salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| and we've got an MOU where we say we want to improve teacher salaries by 4% every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| until we get up into the competitive salary range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| And, of course, with no salary increase, we make no progress towards that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| and that is written in the MOU, and it is provided that the funding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| So that kind of, in a nutshell, I guess, takes you through the last three weeks, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| So, Commissioner, whatever you wish the format to be at this point in terms of questions and answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| and we'll try to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I appreciate the binders that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| Can you not hear my loud voice, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| I appreciate the work going into the binders and having those available for us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| Do you want to get, just ask your finance team if there's certain things on certain pages that they'd like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| to say here's where we saved money, here's now, other than what you just said, where we're getting killed on in costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=765)|
| 0:12:56| So, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| You all have the books in front of you right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| To me, the best overview to look at would be, of course, the revenue and the expenditure overviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=783)|
| 0:13:12| Those don't exactly point out exactly cuts that were made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| but if you look at the expenditure overview specifically, what page number is it in that packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=796)|
| 0:13:25| If you'll give us the page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| And while you're looking that up, I did want to see that the chairman of the Knox County School Board is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| but it was kind of hard to see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Patty Bounds is with us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| The expenditure overview should be in your summary tab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| I believe it's recommended expenditure is page three of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=825)|
| 0:13:58| So, just looking through this one quickly, I'm going to mention some of the things that Mr. Thomas mentioned there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| but this kind of groups it into different sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Of course, the negative numbers are the areas where expenditures have been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| I don't want to read through all of those just for the sake of time, but that's one snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| The other one is right after that, which is the line item expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| There's three pages of that, and if you look over to the right where it says percentage change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| you can see there those that are in the red are the expenditures that have decreased over the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=868)|
| 0:14:40| You're talking about the last two pages under the summary, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Okay, just make sure we're on the right page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| No, it says operating budget, that says one of three, two of three, three expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| It should be right in succession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| It says general purpose school operating budget FY 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=897)|
| 0:15:16| What was the in-service and other supplements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| Which page are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| I'm looking at page one of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| It was a 271.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=927)|
| 0:15:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| About halfway down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| I'm looking at it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=945)|
| 0:16:02| Give us a second to find the answer to that one, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=965)|
| 0:16:29| Just for a guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=989)|
| 0:16:51| I mean, that wasn't critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| I just happened to see the large number and thought, well, that's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| My first thought is, and Dr. Isaac was talking about our cultural competency training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| I believe it has to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Oh, right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Yeah, you briefed us at commission about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| And there were some other line items that we reclassified from last year to make them a little more accurate for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1026)|
| 0:17:14| But we'll find the exact answer on that and get back to you here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| And then, I guess, about a third of the way down, there was a 66.9% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| Something what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Other full-time regular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Just a new employer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| No, in the budget, there's a new program this year, and it's part of the superintendent's reading and underperforming schools initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1055)|
| 0:17:47| And we had 20 FTEs at the time of publishing the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| We were still working with Dr. Isaac and his team as far as what exactly the makeup of those FTEs were going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| So at the time of publishing, we made them just full-time regular employees, and so that's why that item has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1079)|
| 0:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Yeah, hey, I've got a – it'll probably be an easy question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Can you hear me if I talk like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| I'm sure you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| You know, our debt service funding, the amount that you budgeted for a debt service has actually gone down this year on here by about $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1099)|
| 0:18:27| Can you elaborate a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Is it because your principal has gone down a little, so your debt payment, or did you guys restructure any debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| If you could kind of elaborate on how we got that $300,000 positive change related to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1114)|
| 0:18:45| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Three of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| So what I have on that is – and, again, Mr. Thomas mentioned that Mr. Spencer, our CFO, retired recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1128)|
| 0:18:57| I do have his debt service schedule, and based on what I can tell from looking at this, it looks like for fiscal year 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1137)|
| 0:19:08| it looks like just a decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| I can't tell if it's exactly –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| on the sheet I have, I just have the cumulative decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| So to answer your specific question, I'm not sure if it's interest or principal on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| Normally what happens, too, because Chris can really talk about debt because we work with Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| a portion of debt is paid out of school construction and then out of general purpose as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Normally what happens, like a project may have fallen off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| I mean, it was paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| Something could have gotten off the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Could have left a last payment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Or if some of our principal had come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| And, again, we'll make sure we get with Chris and figure that out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| But generally speaking, because there's multiple bonds and issues and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| when something is paid off, it does fall off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| It lowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| So Chris, it looks like you may have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1198)|
| 0:20:08| One of the responses would be from 2011 to 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| the board's portion of overall debt service dropped from about $286 million to about $243 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| That will cause a reduction in overall payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| And so they did see a spike in 2017 because the third portion of the two middle schools got it back to the $280.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| But that's the smoothing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| And it really wouldn't have a lot to do with interest from the standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| that we're always going to budget variable rate debt at 4.5% or 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| Now, they won't ever pay that rate unless interest rates spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| But I think from a budgeting standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| it's just because the last five or six years we've decreased our total level of bond debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| So that's a reduction in payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| It is kind of the principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Can Chris step there just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| When we're figuring, we talked about our debt on the general side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Is the school debt, as we look at the interest rates creeping up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| is the school debt figured in at a conservative rate as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| So we've got some room to, you know, if we miss a couple of percentage points, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| And so basically their debt along with ours, we will budget our variable rate debt at 4.5% or 5% in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1277)|
| 0:21:25| And I think we've been paying probably 2, 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| So we've got that built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| And so their rates would be the same as ours because their bond issues are all in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| and we just tell them what their payments are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| You figure that, Chris, at the worst case scenario if cap were to maximize during that period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Yeah, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1311)|
| 0:22:03| Operating budget area of utilization by program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Area of utilization program, page 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Contracts with other as a 10% decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Actually, it's a 41% decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| What are those contracts that we are no longer going to be participating in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| I'm sorry again, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Which page are you looking at exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Did you say page 404?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Page 404 of which tab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Right before expenditure detail, the last page before expenditure detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| Does everybody understand where he's talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| He's on areas of utilization by program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| If you look at your expenditures detail page, it's the one just before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| It's the page that precedes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| The contract services that I believe that's referring to was the reduction in the project grad contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| And that went from a little bit over $1 million to $500,000 in the latest revised board-approved budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| Also in this areas of utilization by program under initiatives, I see that reading and underperforming school support has went up 158%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1404)|
| 0:23:40| Could you please explain those programs and what they're intended to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Because that's a large, significant investment into something I think is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| So that's the program I referred to earlier that Mr. Thomas started with the literacy initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| Several different FTEs make that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| I'm going to let Dr. Reiswick speak or Mr. Thomas speak to exactly what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I think John can speak to it more eloquently than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| But, again, part of that is work in progress as well in terms I know John and his folks have been working to identify what works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1449)|
| 0:24:19| Because, again, we in some of our schools, the reading proficiency is not what it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| So we want to make sure this next year that that is the focus and that we start seeing some gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| The state has I think the state's goal is 75% of third graders reading at grade level by the year 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1474)|
| 0:24:44| Right now we're around 40% with proficiency, which is not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| In some of our more schools, at-risk schools, the percentage is even less according to the testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| the last testing we had, the benchmark that we got back in the fall, roughly 11% proficiency in some of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1499)|
| 0:25:10| So, again, I want to make sure that we put in place a program that's going to make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| and that we are able to measure that throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| I don't want it to be a situation where we have to wait a year to see if there's been progress or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| But I think we're going to have to do a better job of finding out what works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| and making sure that we take that model that does work and we're doing it everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| But I know John has done a bit more work with that, so I'll let John speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| So these positions basically at three of the schools, our three priority schools that do hit the category Mr. Thomas spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| the bottom 5% in achievement in the state, those schools are Lonsdale Green and Saramore Green currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| On our last look at grades three through five that are tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Lonsdale had like a 6.1% rate of literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| So when you put that to the number of students, just to give you a perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| it was 15 students that were reading on mastery or above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| And, again, to say this, that's not because those schools aren't trying extremely hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| They have lots of challenges that are in that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| So I think what Mr. Thomas is proposing here is basically a reading facilitator to be assigned to those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| along with three educational assistants that can help do some pull-outs for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| and intervene with students for additional things that they need and supports they need for reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| Let me say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| It's not that these schools haven't been doing any literacy or any reading support for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| Some of that has been funded by state grants and things that have been there at the school levels that have now expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| The state's ended those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| So we would lose a lot of the supports that we currently have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| But I think this is a much more concentrated effort to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| He mentioned formative assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| There's something, as well, that we're looking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| There's always a balance of how much do you assess students, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| you do need something that kind of breaks it every quarter to tell where students are performing so you can intervene quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| And then we also have assigned teams of our executive director of elementary education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| who has a stellar record of being a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| She is assigned there, as well as a literacy person and a math person from the district level that will be surrounding that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| I think since January she's been in there 18 times, speaking to each of those principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| and having talks through those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| So it's really about carefully monitoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| There's still no silver bullets, but we think this is the right strategy to put forward to try to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Yeah, I guess Mr. Thomas, Mr. Ross or Keith, you're the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| So as we looked at the discussion prior to the vote, I guess we're talking about Project GRAD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| and we're talking about TAG and all these things that we've eliminated or partially eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| So if we're going for literacy early, which I think is the key, obviously, we all agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| We're kind of leaving the middle school and the high schools behind if we're not paying some sort of attention to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| So as we gather the younger grades and try to improve proficiency in literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1691)|
| 0:28:20| the Gifted and Talented Program is an amazing program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| and these kids are going to get bored and not want to be excelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| And so how do we measure those and why are we taking those away that matter in those programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1708)|
| 0:28:39| Thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I think as this team's worked on this budget, I don't think any of those decisions are ones that we wanted to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| so it's not about being ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| I mean, it really has come down to budget, as we've talked a lot about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| In the core academics, if you kind of think about a bell-shaped curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| we're at a place budget-wise where we have to protect that core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| and when you protect that core, it's the two fringes that typically suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| And what we heard in this budget cycle over the last three weeks were both ends of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| the supports for the impoverished and the lower achieving and then the high end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| So, you know, we really had to double down on core literacy, math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| the things that state holds us accountable to, not that those other things are necessarily expendable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| but when it comes to, you know, making choices of where we have to make those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| And so we stand behind totally what people are saying about the gifted and talented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| We had a situation where we began with 20 positions that were supporting gifted and talented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| There's a lot of different strategies and philosophies about how to best do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| but the important thing is that you're doing something for those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| And about halfway through the school year, two things happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| One was, you know, as an overall district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| we have two people at the district level to support our math for over 90-plus schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| We had new math adoptions, and our schools were drowning in support for math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| so we made a decision to shift some of those folks in to support math and reading at a deeper level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| which cut that number down to 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| We had 13 for the rest of the year, which, you know, which is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| So it's really not enough to serve the kids that we're looking at and how broad we want to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| So we were kind of forced to look at a couple different service models moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| One would be you can coach teachers over time to be able to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| We do, you may be familiar with RTI, the response to intervention that we deal with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| for the lower end of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Well, this is no different for the upper end of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| So the strategy we had to use there is kind of coach our classroom teachers up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| and they have intervention periods during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| You can use that same strategy for the upper end where you're coaching teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Bottom line, though, is you're putting all this on the same classroom teachers that are teaching during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| and now they're differentiating for the lower end and the upper end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So that's not an ideal strategy, but it is a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| It would probably take us about three years to get to a place where we had a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| and that much competency buildup without the pullout service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Another model would be to do the pullout, which we're kind of more used to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| where we kind of have these kids identified and we send these people to different schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| these coaches and teachers to pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| And the problem is they have to focus on that almost solely if you had 13 doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| They couldn't coach and support teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| And then the third model would be you raise the standard for what you identify those at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| so you identify fewer students, which is not ideal either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| So none of those are ideal scenarios, but what we landed with in this one was the continue to pullout service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| We've heard that loud and clear from parents and also from principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| But still, you know, it's inadequate for what we need to do, but the best we can do in this budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| I know it's never enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| I've already asked this question before, but how much money is it to maintain that talented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| and gifted tag and also the project grad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| Because I feel like what we've done is we've had this conversation as a system in private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| The public really didn't know what was coming until the budget was about to get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| and it created an unnecessary chaos where we didn't have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| So what are we losing in tag money-wise, and what are we losing in project grad money-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1915)|
| 0:32:04| So if we're talking, Mr. Anders, you're talking about funding project grad at the full level that we did last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| Yeah, what did we cut, and what did we cut in tag this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| So the project grad, it would require another $500,000 to fully fund it at its current level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1934)|
| 0:32:23| The gifted, talented, John, is it three coaches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1943)|
| 0:32:36| So currently we are at 13 gifted and talented instructional support positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| so that's approximately $230,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| Dr. Reiswick said to get back to where we really need to be, you're talking about having 20 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| So you're adding, if you add 10 more back, you're talking about $770,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| Randy gave me this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| It's about 1.3 total is what we cut out of grad, magnet, and gifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| 1.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| That's the difference between what's funded now and what it would take to fully fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| That's for project grad and the GT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| So 1.3 would bring us back to where we were last year until we can have a discussion about what programs are effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| Because that's been kind of my desire is to calm the conversation down a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| until we can have a rational conversation about what works and what doesn't and why we're doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| because the community just went up in arms whenever we ended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| So I'll work toward that, and as a commissioner I'll try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| I think the mayor's office is already, Chris and the mayor's office is already working toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| But hopefully we can find a way to maintain what we got for a year to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| I hope that's what we can get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Yeah, Mr. Anders, just to be clear, I misspoke there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| The 1.3 would fully fund project grad, magnet, and the GT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2040)|
| 0:34:07| And how much money do you all have in undesignated fund balance over the required state monies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| It is approximately $7.5 to $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Over the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I know we want to try to maintain a balance, but I was just checking to see where we were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I think overall we're right at about $25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| Of course, hopefully we'll close, some will close in for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| I know the goal is to try to get up to $30 million, which is one month payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| And out of that $25, I think there's about $1.8 to $2 million designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And then if you look at the 3%, take that off, that leaves you somewhere around $7.5 to $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| I think we can get to where we need to be then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Mr. Chair, if I could, I just want to go back to the question you asked to lead off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| The 271% increase on that in-service line item was for the 16 extra days that we're paying for the priority and cusp schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2091)|
| 0:35:02| That's right at $1 million that we didn't have in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| How many total teachers do we have in Knox County schools presently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2112)|
| 0:35:25| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| We've got that number here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2126)|
| 0:35:53| Mr. Thomas said it's roughly 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| I believe the exact number is 3,870 roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| And then how many of those would qualify for the step increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| So I believe with our current year numbers, 21.7% of that number has topped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2167)|
| 0:36:17| So you're talking about roughly 79% would qualify for a step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2185)|
| 0:36:33| Obviously a lot of us, I'm assuming, my colleagues have received a lot of emails about the different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| There seems to be some confusion among some of the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Actually, how many schools are classified as magnet schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| So could somebody address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| That is interesting because magnet has kind of taken on some different definitions through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| And so we have some schools that are fully unzoned schools like the L&N STEM Academy that's a full magnet school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2222)|
| 0:37:10| So they would have no enrollment if it weren't for students electing or families electing to transfer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| And then we have other schools that have magnet programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| And that would be like Fulton High School that has a communication magnet program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| They take about 25 to 40 students a year who qualify just for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| But all in all, if we put all of those together, there are eight schools that we classify as magnet schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| How many would classify as a full magnet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| That would be the Career Magnet Academy at Straw Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| That would be L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Those are the only two that are fully unzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2261)|
| 0:37:50| And I have one more quick question for Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Will the two middle schools open on time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Absolutely, they're going to be ready to open on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| All right. I had a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| It looks like the total cost to operate both schools is $8.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| What is the incremental cost? I'm getting different figures on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| I've got a $4.6 million figure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| What is the true incremental cost of operating these two schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| So the incremental cost, and I don't think this worksheet is in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| but we have a worksheet scheduled for each of the new middle schools, and we'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| But just to answer that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| incremental cost is anything above and beyond what we're currently spending in this current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| For example, we had to hire, obviously, new teachers for these two schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| but a portion of that teacher base is already under contract with us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| They're just going to be placed there through transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| So that's where the incremental comes from, is how many total teachers do we need there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| versus how many new ones are we going to have to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| And that difference was the incremental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Go ahead, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| I was just going to say, I think the total in middle school is roughly 19 more positions for this next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| than we currently have in middle school now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Of course, you've got the administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| You've got the operating costs like utilities and transportation and custodial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2371)|
| 0:39:39| and things of that nature that add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| So 4.6 is the number for both schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| Yeah, we round it to 4.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| It's 4.69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Okay, which is actually, I believe, lower than the figure we were assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| whenever we decided to build the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| I think we were told anywhere from $4 million to $6 million would be the incremental cost difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| I think I remember those conversations, so I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| I'd like to change and go, I guess it's Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| Let's go to the capital projects, the paving projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| Since nobody's brought that up, this is on the memorandum here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| So we'll change the pages if anybody wants to follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| Go to the last, well, I guess the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| I appreciate the putting in the $50,000 for South Dole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| We do have a safety issue out there that we're very concerned about, kids crossing the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| This you're not going to be able to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| This might be for Doug, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| I'd like to have an update on the cost savings of the HEBAC that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| the improvements for the energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| You don't have to answer that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| You can do that unless you know what that's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I don't know it off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| I know that we've avoided millions of dollars in utility costs over the last several years since we put that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| but we'll get our energy manager to run those numbers, and I'll get it for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| We'll share it with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Yeah, I noticed we got, what, $3.21 million that we're trying to budget for this year for the energy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| That's ñ show me the page you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| Page two of this memorandum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Third paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Third paragraph down where it says PPE roofing in HVAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| There is a lot of cost savings in upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Well, what we're looking at is those are our physical plant upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| and there is a list of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| I believe it's attachment B to this memorandum that details what we're looking at those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| and that is not directly related to energy costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| Those are more broadly throughout the system, a number of different projects that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| I was looking over the ñ my schools in South Knoxville, I go there quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| and the parking lots and the driveways are pretty bad, disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| How did you come up with the asphalt evaluation process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| I know they're rated like Moreland Heights I show on page ñ probably next to the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| It's rated at 80.95, which I think is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| But then you go down to South Dole Middle, rated at 70, and that parking lot is in terrible shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| It's lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| And Gap Creek's at 10, which I agree with that 10 at Gap Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| So what was the process in doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| We went through a process over about three or four months where our grounds department went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| and looked at every parking lot that we've got, and I've got photographs to back up all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| So if you want one, we can share all that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| But it was Chris's guys that put all that information together and went through the detail of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| So I let him explain exactly how they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| They went to each site and took photographs, and then they just compared each location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| and they put a priority list of what they felt was good asphalt versus bad asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| and just put a priority list together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Now, are you going to go off this priority list by number system, who comes first, second, third, fourth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| or is there another criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Our intention is to work down that by priority as it's established on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| but I think the funds we have available will drive some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| For example, if the third item on the list is a $100,000 project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| and we've only got $50,000 left in the budget for that year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| we may go down the list and see if we can pick up a smaller project for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| But our intention is to stay with this priority list as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| So the priority list is the list without the grades of 80, 95, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| The first one would be North Knox Vocational, Cedar Bluff, Christenbury, down like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| Is that correct, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I think we're looking at the worst is Gap Creek, and then we were looking at Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| Okay. So we'll go back to where the numbers is, where Gap Creek shows being a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Yes, sort of, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| It really starts with the first page in attachment D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| and it's just the list of schools in priority order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| and that list is built on the percentage numbers that are in the subsequent pages of that attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| We're only looking at $450,000, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| That's just for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| We have not had a—and, again, we're talking about the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| so we're talking about pieces of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| We haven't walked through the whole plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| but we are limited this year by the agreement between the board and the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| on capital $12.4 million in our capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and that's what we've drawn this plan to try to accomplish all the projects that we've laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| I can tell you that $450,000 is not a dent in what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| but we need to get a line in our capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| where every year we're doing something to address our asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| and I'd like to do a whole lot more than what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| We haven't gone through and tallied up all the work that we've got to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| but it wouldn't surprise me if we've got $30 million worth of asphalt work that needs to be done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| So we need to have a process to address it, and this is really just trying to start that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| I guess a follow-up question, I guess, Chris or Russ, either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| would be some of the areas like South Dome Middle, you know, the main driveway area looks good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| but then the parking lot's got chugged hoes, broken pavement, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| Would you do partial there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Would that just be a partial repair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| We have looked at doing most of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| I think we avoided the very bottom section, but we have a price in place to do probably 80% of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| Yeah, because it will vary because some spots are great and then some spots it needs to be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| Thanks for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Can I follow up with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| That's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Is it all or none, or is it like, you know, we can just split it up to where, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| there's a section that's 20% of this can be done in parts, or it's all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| It varies by location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Oh, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| So there's some you may go there and it's three parking lots that are kind of divided and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| well, this one needs a lot of work and that one can be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| And we can do it in pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| What we don't want it to look like is a patch job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| No, I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| I was just trying to figure out, though, how it was measured, the percentage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| And we've had opportunity in the past to address some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Like when we did the addition to Moreland Heights Elementary School two or three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| we had the opportunity to redo most of the paving out there as part of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| So when we get an opportunity to do this as parts of other projects, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| But I think we really need a concerted effort to where we're every year doing something with our asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| I just wanted to add the reason why I'm late is I had my budget meeting with Mayor Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| and also Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| So we have been in the building and that is why we're just now here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| So I just wanted to clarify to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| Mayor Burchett was running late, and so that made my meeting with Mayor Burchett late and then Miss Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| Mr. Chair, I've got about three more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| So we've got to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| I've got two operational questions based on some stuff that you all shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| and then one probably easy capital question after the capital request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| The capital request, you're requesting one modular classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| Which school is that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Is that just for temporary growth or is there a plan to expand there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| If you could clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| That's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| I can answer that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| We have budgeted $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| That will get us at our current price as we think about one two-room modular classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| We've got that money also is available in the current year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| So we have programmed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| We're currently in the design process for one at Hardin Valley Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| that we're going to try to get in over the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| and then we're looking at one at Starkey Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| that we'll try to start over the summer and we'll probably get in early in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Then a couple of just operational questions based on some stuff that you all shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| One thing, Bob, you had mentioned is that we may be getting some more state funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| based on at-risk students or an increase in the appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| We're not sure exactly where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| State funds related to at-risk students, are those designated for a particular program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| Are those just for general operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| What is that appropriation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| How is that determined, and do they say you need to spend them in a particular manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| if you don't mind me asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Just, again, basic education program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| you don't have to necessarily spend them in the area that you earn them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| unless you're salary-wise below the state minimum in terms of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| So those funds that come can be budgeted the way the district, I guess, sees fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| But we earn, I think in the formula, it's about $855.75, something like that, per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3018)|
| 0:50:31| So the at-risk number of students, that is the part of the BEP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| And that's the thing that is to be finalized in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| And we think there's a possibility that some additional kids, students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| have been identified as at-risk based on direct certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| So right now we're working with the state on that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Now, the $855 that you earn per student does flow through the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| So it's not a straight $855.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| It's not like you're going to have one check for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| It just increases the total amount to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| But that is the ratio in the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Another question, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| you mentioned the extended contracts to help improve the outcomes in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| But you did mention that in some of those extended contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| some of them can be either to extend the day or to extend the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Is that something that is determined at the school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| or is that something that you kind of let –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| how is the determination made when we invest in extended contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| Is that – do you give each principal kind of the opportunity to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| how they're going to use that for their budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Or if you could elaborate on that a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| I think that's pretty relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you, Mr. Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| As Mr. Thomas said, the six schools that were identified on the CUSP list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| are the ones that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| are trying to intervene because they were falling in that range of the bottom 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| that the state gave us, the bottom 10% achievement that the state gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| So one of those plans was to have the 216-day contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| Currently, as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| four of those six are going to use it for professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| and two for extending the day for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| And the rationale that goes into that, I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| there's a team, our executive director of elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| as well as our – for secondary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| and they have a reading person, which is our reading supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| and our math supervisors at the top of those divisions that work on that team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| working with the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| And some of the major things that went into that decision were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| in the places where they're opting for professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| they've had high rates of turnover at Green and at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| Those two schools, Green Elementary and Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| they've had a 40% turnover of their staff this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| And so kind of the rationale for that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| instead of giving them longer time with, you know, kind of new teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| it's better to grow the teachers first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| so you get more bang out of your buck in future years if you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| So you have to make sure you're maximizing the ability of the teachers first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| Other schools at Saramore Green and Lonsdale, they're going to extend their day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| They had an extended day this year off of some state funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| and their staff didn't see as much turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| so they felt like they were getting more benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| of having their students for an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| That was a good outcome of the measure, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| I have a question about the priority school state grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Back in December, that was designated for Green Magnet Elementary, Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| Saramore Green, and Vine Middle Magnets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| And can you talk about the $531,000-plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| that are going to be dedicated to those schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| and the impact of what that means for the grant breakdown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| There's actually, this is kind of another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| that complicated our budget a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| Those schools did receive school improvement grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Vine was one of the schools that was in a cohort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| that received school improvement grant of over $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| And then also the iZone grants that you're speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| about being priority schools for Lonsdale, for Saramore Green, and for Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| Those were grants that existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| Federal law went through adoption of the ESSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| as opposed to No Child Left Behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| They passed the Every Student Succeeds Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| And with that and the new list of priority schools coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| the state made the decision to end those grants this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| So June 30, they'll end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| And then the new crop of priority schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| will be eligible for those new grants, new dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| but that won't come until the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| So we're kind of in a tough spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| because in the good side of that, as Mr. Thomas has spoken to before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| we didn't have any schools on kind of the warning list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| that came out last year that were bottom 5%, which is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| The bad side of that is we may not be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| for any of those state dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| which you just mentioned how much those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| So we're kind of in this in-between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| Last year, out of the SIG grant at Vine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| it funded 221-day contracts for all the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| When those grants dried up this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| we were forced to kind of go back on our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| and make that investment out of the general purpose dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| that had been grant-funded before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| So extension of those contracts fell back on general purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| where grant dollars had done that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Where we are right now, we're told we can apply in June for July monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| but we don't know how much that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| And if, you know, I know we've had a few glitches in testing in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| so the termination of priority schools moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| may be that we don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| And if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| we would only receive one year of funding on a three-year cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| and then our dollars, we wouldn't receive those dollars anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| So it's hard for us to count on those long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| which is a good thing, again, because we're doing better academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| But, you know, to be 6% versus 5%, we still need those levels of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| So that's why, you know, our board kind of filled in with general purpose dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| which is a big cost to the budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| So it would be the same schools that are identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| and if you don't receive the funding, does the iZone still impact those schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| Those six schools would be now, because at Austin East, Bell Morris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| and all those with the four priority schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| so Austin East and Bell Morris would come into that mix as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| Any of those could potentially be bottom five schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| That's why they kind of give us that warning from the bottom ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| So if none of them are whatever the priority rankings are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| then none of them would receive that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| The iZone is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| So the iZone grant was similar to the SIG grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| in that both of those dry up this year, June 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| and we won't have those dollars unless we can apply for the four priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| to potentially get money again, but there's no guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| And on the same line of my questioning, under the fiscal year 2018 BEP plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| the $1,073,000 that's going to Gibbs School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| how is that, I guess it's for the startup of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| or the infrastructure of the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Could I have some understanding associated with that amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Ms. Gill, I believe the item you're referring to was an additional BEP appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| That the board voted to approve back in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| And so at that point we had conservatively estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| how much our BEP allocation was going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| and after the final July estimate we had that much that we could ask for appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| At that point we asked our school board for a $489,000 appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| And that was a portion of the $1 million figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| And the $489,000, and I'm not sure we talked about this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| I'm not sure if you were in here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| but the $489,000 was the additional appropriation we asked for startup costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| for both Gibbs Middle and Hardin Valley Middle School for this current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| So you're just dividing it in half because the startup staffing committed is roughly $236,000 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3481)|
| 0:58:10| Is that dedicated for Gibbs or is that dedicated for Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| I don't have the exact figure in front of me, but yes, to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| the $489,000 was both schools combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| So the only expenditures that we budgeted from that extra million appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| was for the new middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| Is our BEP final, which is the number indicated in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| for July final is $207,819,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| Is that number still good or is this fluid because that's what it's indicated in here for FY18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3523)|
| 0:58:54| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| So for FY18, I believe the adopted budget BEP number was $206,746,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3535)|
| 0:59:04| And if you look to the next line down from that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| the final allocation was additional appropriation we received in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| So that number is the 2.674 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| So those two combined was our final current year BEP allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3562)|
| 0:59:36| Yeah, just a quick question on Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3576)|
| 0:59:47| Do we have a figure on what, and I'm assuming you can do a little bit or you can do a lot out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| Do we have a figure in our mind of what it would take to do some of the things we'd like to do at Adrian Burnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3594)|
| 1:00:05| Let me hang my toes over the precipice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| What I'm going to talk to you about is not something that we've talked about in detail with our board yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| So I'm limited on how much detail that we can go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| The way we've got it written in our capital plan is that there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| there's two issues that we feel that we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| One is we call the Northwest Elementary Solution and the growth that we're seeing in the northwest portion of the sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| Hardin Valley Elementary School and Carnes Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| The other that we've been struggling with for a number of years right now is what we call the North Central Elementary Solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| And we think that an Adrian Burnett solution needs to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| Whatever the whole solution is, Adrian Burnett needs to be a subset of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| And we've had discussions with Ms. Bounds and Commissioner Busworth as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| We previously recommended doing an additional renovation to that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| which would add administrative space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| It would add gymnasium space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| It would address cafeteria space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| It could address the aesthetics of the school on the exterior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| and give it a stone or brick facade if we wanted to go down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| That process, as we looked at it, given how tight that campus is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| and the extent of work that we would have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| and where all of the portables are sitting is where we would need to build an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| We looked at that and said, well, this needs to be tied into another project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| so that we can reduce the population on that campus of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| and then go back in and do the additional renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| But we've also talked to, as we talked to Ms. Bounds and Mr. Busworth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| they've indicated a preference to put a new school on that campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| And we've looked at that, and we think it's probably feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| I mean, I'll let Mr. Dillingham talk to that because he's the one that sketched it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| It would be a difficult and tight project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| But like I'm saying, we haven't talked to the board in depth about any of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| and we haven't made a recommendation to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| What we're talking about is just stuff that we've kicked around back and forth at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| May I be hearing you wrong, but correct me if I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| that if there were a new school built down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| doing a lot of these renovations may be something that might not be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| but it would solve the problem if we own down the road, build a new school in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| and then Adrian Burnett just goes away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| What we had talked about was the possibility of if you built a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| you zone a portion of the Adrian Burnett student population into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| It makes the population on the campus smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| We don't need the portables anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Those go away, and then you still come in and do an additional renovation to that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| to serve the rest of the population that remains there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| Commissioner Brantley, nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| Okay, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| How old is Adrian Burnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| Ms. Bounds knows that better than I do probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| but I think it was built in the late 70s or early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| How many students are at Adrian Burnett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3831)|
| 1:04:00| Don't quote me on this because I don't have the numbers in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| but we've got about 500 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| This is a really good object discussion for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| because our current five-year projection doesn't show a lot of growth at Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3852)|
| 1:04:22| That's built on numbers that we had available to us last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| What is occurring right now is there's an action working its way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| through the Metropolitan Planning Commission and the various approval processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| There's a developer looking to put a small subdivision in out on Crippen Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| very close to, well, it's actually property that's adjacent to where the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| and the senior center are, and that could give us or generate as many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3886)|
| 1:04:54| as 30 to 40 elementary grade students that would be in the Adrian Burnett zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| that we're not capturing in our current projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| There's a similar issue that we've got in the Brickey zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| with a development that's working its way through the approval process out on Copeland Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| which I think they're looking at putting in about 400 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| and we anticipate that that would generate about 100 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| 100 elementary students in the Brickey zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| So that would throw our Brickey projections as they are currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| or it would throw them way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| It would give Brickey about a 9% or 10% growth number over the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| and that's significantly more than we're showing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| To answer those questions, it was built fall of 1976 when it was opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| and it was all temporary, and it is still very temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| So there are about 500 students there, which they took from Brickey kind of at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| But as we all know, that area is fast-growing also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| I mean, just go check 1-8-zip codes and see how many houses are out there for sale right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| So these students and these families have really put up with a lot of stuff through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| and we have owned property, and this school has been neglected for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| and being born and raised out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| That is not my district, but at one time it was, and it will always have a place in my heart for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| So I'm speaking for your Adrian Burnett, and there is work to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| and we are expecting a lot more to be going into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| Planning ahead there will be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| Since I've reached my limit, I'm sorry for coming in tardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| Have we already discussed or had a conversation centered around teacher pay increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| and the cost of the health care associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| I mean, okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Okay, so then somebody else will catch me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| I just needed to touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| That brings up a good point about has the staff discussed at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| because of the health care cost increases, of moving to a system of being self-insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4037)|
| 1:07:26| They're all looking at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| We several years ago, I guess, had that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| In order to be eligible for the state funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| you have to have a plan that's equal to or greater than the state plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| Also, at the time, in order to make a move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| it would require a vote of the teachers to actually make that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| Then some of the systems that have been self-funded, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| have actually come into the state plan because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| you're sort of out there by yourself if you're self-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| So being a part of the state plan I think has been good for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| It's a little bit richer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| In hindsight, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| Again, this was several years ago when we looked at the possibility of moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| and it's costly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| But as I say, you remove yourself from the pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| so you're really subject to whatever increases might come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| We got that, but that was six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Have we thought to open this conversation again or to look at what it's going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| We haven't looked at it since we did it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| but it's something we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| There is some problems with the retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| Our system doesn't offer insurance to employees after they retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| whereas part of the school system does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| and we would have to have a plan that did that in order to match the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4131)|
| 1:09:06| What other questions do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| Any other comments from you or your staff that we need to be aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4151)|
| 1:09:20| No, sir, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| I think we said it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Again, as Commissioner Gill brought up, salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| that's the part of this that's not in the budget, and the 1% for certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4168)|
| 1:09:36| we talked about 1% I think is $2.3 million to do 1% for certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| and then 1.2 for classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| I'm sorry, I did come in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| I hate I missed probably the conversation centered around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| because in your address at the school board meeting talking about the issues of literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| associated with Green, Magnet, and Sarah Moore Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| did I miss the discussion of the plan to deal with the issue of literacy at those schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| I'm sorry, did I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| I've already missed all of the hot topic on that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| We did talk about that, and what we've got in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| I think the cost is roughly a little over $500,000 to focus on the three schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4221)|
| 1:10:29| Green, Sarah Moore Green, and Lawnsdale, three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| We're still in the development phase of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| but putting a reading facilitator full-time for each of those schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| and then some pull-out programs for students that are deficient in reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| I know Shannon can talk about this much better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| but the year-long reading program that we've been doing in terms of expanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| Maybe let Shannon, if you will, talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| We have a reading course that we offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| and we'll be working through that course with our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| We actually pay for subs and pull them out for ten half days during the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| so that we can work with them not only on understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| how you take the letters off the page to make the sounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| but also to work on meaning and that there is a knowledge base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| that we need to build as we go through our reading courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| We go through our curriculum materials to ensure that students are getting exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| to the knowledge they need in order to build background knowledge to read texts later in life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| and to be able to write to the texts that they're reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| We also have a student work protocol that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| It's the equip protocol, helping to make sure that our tasks that we're giving the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| are aligned to what they need to be doing at grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| and coming back together as a group and looking at what the students are producing in their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| and then determining from there what specific interventions the students need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| in order to build their reading proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| John, I had just one question, and I might have missed this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| It may not come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Do we have out a list of what positions each school is going to be losing for this next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4327)|
| 1:12:15| or what they'll be gaining in terms of counselors, teachers, office workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4335)|
| 1:12:23| in each of our schools to be able to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| We have, I believe you're referring to our staffing allocation sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| Those are not part of your packet, but we'll get those to you as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Okay, because I would love to have that because I do have a lot of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| for my schools in District 2 on our positions that we're going to be told that we're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4361)|
| 1:12:51| Mr. Chair, may I make one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Joe reminded me in the past we've met individually with commissioners, board members, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| and I'd still like to offer that to anyone who would like to have an individual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| We thought this would be a good test to see because it tied up a lot of time for your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| to have 11 separate meetings with the 11 commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| but hopefully from the commission standpoint, hearing a question from Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| or Commissioner Smith or Commissioner Denton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| we've all now gained some additional knowledge that we wouldn't have thought to ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| so I'd like to see us do this again if it's agreeable with you and your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| And you say again, you mean for this budget this year or for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| Next year, yeah, but obviously we can talk individually with the staff on any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4420)|
| 1:13:48| Mr. Thomas, if you'll send out available dates, I'll respond to one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| and I would love to have a sit-down meeting, but send out available dates to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| and whoever responds first gets the first slot or like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| Yes, sir, we'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| Was there any other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| Yeah, just a quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| I'm sorry to back up the capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| but normally every meeting I've had with the school board always gave me the five-year kind of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| Do you all have one of those you can just shoot me in an email or something of what's coming on down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| We have not built it out beyond five years because of where our revenue has been set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| and I think that's a conversation that we'd like to have in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| This is only two years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| But you do have a five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| We have not built it out because of where our revenue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| So those are discussions that we'd like to have with the board in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| I mean, I think the average is $12 million, $15 million, or $10 million or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| Outside of new construction, in the past we've asked for $15 million a year in order to maintain what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4500)|
| 1:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| I didn't know if there were other things you've kind of in the back of your mind you've got planned out that you know is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| Maybe you haven't made an exact plan out of it, but you know there's things coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| We've got things in our mind that we think we know are coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| but until we have those discussions with the Board of Education, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Thank you very much for all your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| I really appreciate everybody being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| Thank you again, and I appreciate the members of the Knox County School Board being present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| We are concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180503?start=4542)|
