| 0:00:00| Okay. Welcome, everyone, to the special called meeting of December 3rd, or excuse me, February 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=8)|
| 0:00:09| And I would like to ask Ms. Pelow if she'd ask the invocation and Mr. Becker if he'd lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=9)|
| 0:00:21| Ms. Bower-Heads, our father, we come before you with a very special task this evening, a very unusual one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=21)|
| 0:00:31| We pray that you will give us clear minds and help us to come to a decision that will honor the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=31)|
| 0:00:40| and be in the very best interest for the taxpayers whom we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=40)|

| 0:01:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| I think we have two items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| The first is to consider the election of a new vice mayor, and the second is to consider the process for selecting a new representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=95)|
| 0:01:45| from the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| I see a couple of lights, and I'll come to you right in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| Well, actually, I'll just go to the lights and I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| I saw Councilman Hultquist first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| In thinking about this and talking to Mr. Swanson or reading Mr. Swanson's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| we've got some important business before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| I'd just like to, I know council's all aware of this, but I just want to remind everyone that the charter is silent on the selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| of the process for the selection of vice mayor under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| And while we all want to get that out of the way, we want to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| So maybe we can do it tonight, but I just want to remind everyone that we don't have to do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| We're looking at setting up a process for naming a 6th District replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| and we could have more of a process, should we choose, for naming a vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=150)|
| 0:02:39| I'd hope that we would have done that at the last vice mayoral election, but we didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| And I would hope we might have a chance to do that this time if that proves appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Well, I was just wanting to voice my opinion and my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| And I've had a lot of thoughts regarding the process that we should use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| And how the 6th District can best be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| We've lost a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| The 6th District has lost a very good representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| And it really troubles me to think that the eight of us remaining would elect a vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=191)|
| 0:03:21| without the 6th District's representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| So I was going to say something similar to what Mr. Hawkins said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| But I think with me it's a very philosophical discussion that we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| Because I truly, truly feel that every district needs to feel completely represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| And to have that advocate who would be sitting here and be able to cast a vote for something so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| as the vice mayor who's going to lead us in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| I think it's kind of cool not to be the only one with my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| That's kind of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| It's a little scary for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| I guess I wanted to say it's kind of interesting to hear some folks talk about not doing an election tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| because I think there is a challenge about how we actually vote on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| I've been joking with a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| They say, you know, what's the vote going to be like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| And I say, well, it will be an eight-way tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| And there is that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| And we've got the real challenge because there's some level at which an eight-way tie makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| because I think we all can do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| I think we all can do this job well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| They were talking about minor variations in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| So it's a very hard decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| And I want to ask, really, does somebody have some sense, and Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| if you have any experience on this question of doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| is it something where we just start voting and whoever has the least votes is eliminated until we get somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| Have we got any agreement or any previous process on how this works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=293)|
| 0:05:02| Well, I've researched that to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| We have both a historical context and we have a legal context in which the selection process occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| The legal context is that essentially the default position for city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| when it's not otherwise provided in the charter, the code, or your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| The default position is Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| And I have spent an uncomfortable period of time researching Robert's Rules of Order with regard to what it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=326)|
| 0:05:34| about how you elect officers of an organization in these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| It says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Essentially, in these circumstances, the preferred method, apparently, under Robert's Rules of Order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| is to have a nomination and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| And if there is a majority vote for that person, then that person is elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| And if not, then you move on to the next nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| I have to say that that is not the only method by which it could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| There are certainly other methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| And I think reading Robert's very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| I think there are other methods that could be condoned by Robert's as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| and one of which that seems more practical to me under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| And it's strictly up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| I do not feel that you are compelled to follow a single process one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| by the legal rules in this situation because you can always move to amend the rules to adopt your own process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| If you find that your own process for accomplishing a task is more efficient, is more fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| is more reasonable under the circumstances that you face to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| then you can always set aside that default position of Robert's Rules of Order and adopt your own process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| Giving consideration to this particular process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| and knowing that I have heard from a number of council members some interest in this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| it would seem to me that the fairer process, the more reasonable way to approach this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| is to get all of the nominations, all the persons who wish to nominate themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| or somebody else out on the table first before you do anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| Get all the nominations that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| And then once the nominations are out there, frankly, there are a couple of ways you can handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| One way to handle that would be to, once the nominations are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| and the nominations have then been closed, then hold a vote with each council member when called upon to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=455)|
| 0:07:44| voting with someone's name who they wish to vote for for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| Then if no one has achieved a majority, you've got to have five votes under the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| and in the code in this instance, which is different than Robert's Rules of Order as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| But there's no doubt that you have to have five votes for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| And so if you don't have five votes for a particular name at that point, one way that you could do it would simply to be out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=484)|
| 0:08:12| would be to drop from consideration the person who received the lowest number of votes and then vote again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| and keep doing that until you reach a point where somebody either has five votes or you've reached an impasse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| Another way to do it would be to not drop out the lowest vote getter and just continue to have votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| and hope that something would happen to cause the situation that results in impasse to change over the course of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| There are other things that you could do as well, and you all can imagine them as well as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| There's no reason for me to try to throw them all out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| But to me, the most fair method by which you could ultimately end up with a vice mayor being elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=530)|
| 0:08:59| under these circumstances would be get all the nominations out there, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| If you don't have five, then drop the lowest number and keep voting until you either reach impasse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| at which point I think you move to adjourn the meeting until a later date and see if the log jam will break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| Of course, there is a tie-breaking vote available if the tie-breaking vote elects to cast that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| So that to me is kind of where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| And there has been some expression about whether or not you should go ahead with the vice mayor's election tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| And I really don't have an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| That's entirely up to you all whether you want to proceed with this or not is entirely up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| But I am not saying to you that we have to proceed at this date with an election of a vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| I have contacted you all because of the circumstances that existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| because I felt like it was important to go ahead and move forward one way or the other in getting things underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| And also with respect, you know, we only have 30 days under the charter to replace the sixth district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| And so that process and this process needed to be faced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| I wanted to go ahead and give you all the opportunity to address it in whatever way you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| If you all feel like it's a better idea not to elect the vice mayor at this meeting, that's within your prerogative, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| There certainly is no time limit within which you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| I would suggest to you that the vice mayor does, in fact, serve functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| There's some amount of administrative activity involved in running the council office where it's very useful to have a vice mayor on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=634)|
| 0:10:47| And so all things being equal to those of us who are in the office on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| I think having a vice mayor is better than not having a vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| But you all can decide the timing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| And I don't think it's a legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| It's just a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| I saw Councilman Roddy's light next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| I guess I'd just like to echo what my colleagues have said already, and that is I think we are blessed with a very talented council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| And I think any council member sitting here tonight could serve well in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| I think our challenge is to continue the same kind of cooperative leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| and consensus-driven process that's been the hallmark of this council up until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| I think the other thing that's probably on all of our minds is just an acknowledgement of Mark's leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| You know, it happened so suddenly, and I hope we'll have a chance to acknowledge him publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| But it feels really strange not to have him here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| And I just would like to say publicly to all of us that we all miss him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| and we'll miss his leadership because he certainly led this council in a very fine way over the past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| We will acknowledge Mark at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| I think Councilman Woodhull is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| It is hard for him not to be here, especially under these sort of abrupt conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| And I appreciated Councilman Pilo's comments about the sixth district participating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=731)|
| 0:12:20| but I'm not sure that that's really something that we can do in terms of participating in selecting a vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| I'm not sure if this is proper, but I do like the idea of former Councilman Brown having some expression in terms of who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=747)|
| 0:12:42| not necessarily who, but what kind of leadership he advises for the next ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| I mean, it was so abrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| He had some ideas and movement that he was working on in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| I'd like to know what he was thinking and what he was working on and what kind of a person he would advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=777)|
| 0:13:07| I realize it's our decision, but I would like to hear from him if that's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=787)|
| 0:13:15| I'm going to go to Councilman Bailey next since he hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| First of all, Mayor, I'd be interested in seeing what else you had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| because I'm sure you've come prepared to address these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| and it might save us all some time to hear what else you had in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| I really do think this is Council's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Council is choosing their leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| I mean, if you want to know the bottom line, if it comes down to we're hopelessly deadlocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| and nobody can get five votes, will I vote in that occasion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| But I really do think that should be the choice of last resort, that Council should pick their vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| And like I said, if it's hopeless, I will vote in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Other than that, in terms of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| I tend to personally like the idea that Charles suggested in terms of putting all the names out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| who are interested in having a discussion rather than putting one person out for a vote up, vote down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| But that's a personal preference against Council's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| If we were going to consider some of the Council members' thoughts on having the sixth district represented before we take a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=843)|
| 0:14:12| for the vice mayor, what are your thoughts on the length of the process, how long it would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| And that would be something I'd want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| And or, you know, if some of my colleagues have some ideas on the process and the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| The outside time limit is 26 days from today, since the 30 days started when Mark resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| I think, obviously, again, it's Council's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| I would think you'd want to have some sort of public meeting to give people a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| But, again, these are your all's decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Give people a chance to come and present themselves and be interviewed by Council in a public way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| That's just my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| So, obviously, you have to have time to set up a public meeting and do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| That's not a two- or three-day process, would be my only thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| So, but, again, I do want to say this is Council's call in terms of both the process and who you pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| And that would only turn to me in the last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Well, I'd be interested in your or any of the other Council members' thoughts on do we want to announce the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=901)|
| 0:15:09| publicly, do we want to announce it a week from now, do we want it to be two weeks from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| What should the process be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Should we have a meeting in the six districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Should we have it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Should we have a couple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Those are what, you know, what I would want to know before I make a decision on voting for the vice mayor tonight or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I know there's lights, but Councilman Bailey, I guess, asked a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Would anybody like to address the specific question he asked in terms of the six-district process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| If so, just signify and let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Councilman Becker had his light on first, and he indicated he wants to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| So let's let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Yeah, I was just acknowledging lights for a prior order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Well, I guess, I mean, I think two thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| I think that the county commission has developed a process over time with a lot of stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| and starts that we can learn from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| And at some level, what theirs is, is you have a period for nominations for anybody who wants the six-district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| seat can come in and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Then you have a public meeting, then a vote after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| We're truncated in time, so we have to hurry through things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| But I think that the period for nomination has to be long enough for people to think it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| So at some level, deciding in a week is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| I mean, I think we're deciding 24 days from now, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| And we're having the public meeting a little before that, so there's time for people to get involved in us to check them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| And that's my comment to that, and I've got others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Specifically, I'm just looking for maybe raise your hand if you have a comment to Councilman Bailey's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| I'll go to Councilman Frost and then I'll come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| First, we are in the six-district right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Second, we could flip-flop what's on the agenda to take up the process first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| if folks wanted to for figuring out the process and the timeline for the six-district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| Councilman Pelo on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Well, I spoke on it earlier because I really feel so strongly about the district representative being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| to advocate for the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| I just simply do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I guess my ten years of working on the city charter back in the 70s when it was totally revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| and then considering metropolitan government on three different occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| I just have a really strong personal philosophy that each district needs to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| I think each district is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| I think the leadership that comes from that district is critical to us being able, as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| to reflect the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| And I really would feel badly about being put in the position of having to vote tonight for the representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| from that district and that individual then serving with us for the next ten months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| and not being in a position to say that was my choice also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| I participated in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| So I just think that we have been a very connected, very, we've had a very good relationship on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1081)|
| 0:18:09| Councilman Brown has been the epitome of bringing us together, keeping us unified in purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| and in respect for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| And I want to honor that because I feel that that's what he would expect of us in terms of our leadership now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1098)|
| 0:18:27| and going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| So I have strong reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I've thought about it a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| District representation is so critical in my mind, but so is the at-large representation important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1113)|
| 0:18:42| And I don't mean to diminish one or the other, but I think that we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| Personally, I would like very much to hear from those individuals we'll be working from who can speak for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| and would want to give us some indication of why they would like to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| I liked Councilman Woodhull's comments about being interested in knowing if Councilman Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| as citizen Brown now, would have some input that he would like to put to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| and some advice that he would like to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| That would be his decision, of course, but I personally would welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| On this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Okay, go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| I agree with Councilman Pelow, and I really think it needs to be, we need to be clear about the fact that we do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| to select a vice mayor before we make the decision on the assist district position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| And I personally would be more comfortable having that person in place before we make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| And then, of course, worst comes to worst, we won't have to put the mayor in a tie-breaking position, which I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| I think this is Council's decision, and we should, it should be our responsibility to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| And that's a minor consideration compared to what you just articulated, Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| I think that that's really the key to it, though, is making sure that that district has a voice in that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| and I think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Chris, is this light on this or a different comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| No, it's on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| If this is speaking to the appointment of the Councilmember to finish out Mark's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| Councilman Becker, you made the comment about you were sort of suggesting a process taken from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| and when you said that people would provide nominations, what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Just any citizen would have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| It's a mid-resume kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| People would, okay, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Okay, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Yeah, I guess I actually, when I spoke to Joe's comment, I think I was only speaking at the end of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| because there's this interesting question that clearly we need to decide first is are we going to decide the vice mayor now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| or down the road a little piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| And I think Ms. Pilo and Ms. Rolquist, you make a strong argument for waiting on the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| and I can see going either way on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| I'm going to articulate the decide now, and I do that because at one level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| I think that the 6th District appointment is a lot more important than the vice mayor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| But I think that doing the vice mayor first makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Let me articulate doing the vice mayor's first better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| One is I think having a vice mayor to start that process will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| I mean, one of the, my sense is one of the biggest jobs a vice mayor can ever do is help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| with the process of selecting a new council appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| That is something that is a council decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| We do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| It's not an administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| So having a leader will help us a lot in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| The other side, and it's the kind of thing, you know, you hate to even mention things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| but if we're at a point where there are an even number of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| we can fall into a trap of making a decision of the representative for the 6th District based on how they might vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| on the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| And I can't picture people around this table doing that, but it would set up an incentive for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| And that gets a little scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| And I think the county commission, they actually had a case where they did something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| And I don't know if I want to be in a position where that's even something we can think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| Well, I don't want to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Let's stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Can you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Your council has a word that he wanted to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Council's council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Just one thing I wanted to bring to your attention, and I was reminded by Ms. Poplin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| and I thank her for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| It has been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| And, again, I don't have an opinion as to what order you ought to do this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| That's a matter of policy for you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| But I have heard a couple of expressions tonight of folks who have suggested that they would like for the former vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| to come and express his opinions with regard to these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| And I have to say to you that he is now, the vice mayor is now in a judicial position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| And because he is in a judicial position, he is governed by the canons of judicial conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| And the canons of judicial conduct would prohibit someone who holds that judicial position from coming before a public body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| and making any type of policy or public recommendation that has anything to do with anything other than the legal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| So he can't come and express an opinion to council about anything other than the legal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| Councilman Hawkins now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Councilman Becker, going back to your most recent statement, I'm not sure if I understand in part your logic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1420)|
| 0:23:49| which is a little worrisome, but I'm only kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| You actually have some very good logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| And I just want to respond by saying that I think we can make the decisions as well or better if we have nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1436)|
| 0:24:11| And to get to that point, we can have a temporary we've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| We could temporarily, we could draw straws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| We could let somebody chair as we go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| It's not that hard to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| So we can work our way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| I think I'm not trying to belittle your arguments or minimize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| I just think that I think we can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| I don't think there are any impediments of getting there the way that Councilman Pilo is suggesting we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| So in my mind, it's still the preferred way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| And I feel sorry for you if you understood my logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| That's just, but, no, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| And, again, I see strength on both sides of the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| I mean, the value of the sixth district being here is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| And you're right, we can have a, and I would go beyond just somebody as a person to run the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| I think there's some of the set up that we need the help in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| But, yes, we can do that, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Right now I see no lights on and there's no motion on the floor for either of the, right now we're, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| going to move into the election of the Vice Mayor because that's what's first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| I'd just like to make the motion that we take a vote on, I'd like to make the motion that we vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1516)|
| 0:25:27| or make the selection of the sixth district person before we vote on the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| There's a motion and a second that we would have before we elected the Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| we would have, we would select the sixth district rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| and I would assume that somewhere in there would be the whole process for how we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| And I heard a second from Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Then the lights need to be toward this motion at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| What I was going to suggest was we're talking about the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Let's just talk about the sixth district process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| That was going to be my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Well, I think we ought to maybe, we've got 26 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| So maybe we take two weeks to take resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| and after two weeks we have a meeting, a called meeting at some location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| whether it's here in the sixth or out in the neighborhoods where something similar like a debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| or a forum would take place where the community could have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| And we basically have an agenda where the candidates come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| and we can hear their pitch or their, you know, what they want to say to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| And then we might have a question period and then we take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| Right now that's the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| Any other comments on that or we're going to move to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| The motion is to hold off on the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| First do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| And so Councilman Frost asked the question, well, let's talk about what the process would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Councilman Bailey made one suggestion and that's all we have on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| If we're going to do what the current motion is by Councilman Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| I'd suggest a little bit of what Councilman Holquist suggested, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| in case something happens to you, Chrissy's out to get you or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Decent chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| That, you know, I don't know, draw straws or you start, you know, week one for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| first district has it, second, you know, week two, second district has it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| and so on and so forth until that gets settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| In the unlikely event that something happens, that was my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| I think besides, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| That way I wouldn't know who to look out for every week, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| That way, in the unlikely event, there's somebody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| I saw Councilman Bailey's light next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Yeah, I guess I've got just two thoughts on before voting on the Joe's idea that we wait on the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1683)|
| 0:28:12| We haven't really talked about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| Joe talked about something similar to what I talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| Is that kind of what folks are feeling what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| Because at some level, I want to make sure we know what we're doing before we decide we're going to put off on the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| And I guess just as that kind of process makes sense to everybody as a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| And I've got another one after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| I mean, I think that kind of process makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| We need to obviously be open and transparent with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| We need to have some kind of application process with a deadline and then some sort of public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| and then a designated day for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| And I think that, you know, the suggestion that Mr. Swanson made that there is some administrative functions of a vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| has some merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| And whether we do that by drawing straws tonight, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| it does make sense to have somebody just to propel the process of the selection of the six-district seat forward in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| accountability for calling those meetings and making that part happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| I'm going to go to Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I think I saw his light next, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Just so I understand the process that you're proposing, Joe, we establish a meeting in two weeks that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1753)|
| 0:29:22| and we're basically saying anybody who's interested in being appointed to the six-district send in a cover letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| and your resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| And as those cover letters and resumes come in, will they be distributed to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| And then when we arrive at that meeting, all the people who have submitted the resumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| and cover letters will speak, and then we will make a decision at that meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| And I think what we ought to do is go ahead and vote to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| to make the six-district selection first, and then we can start to talk about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I'm going to go to Councilman Hulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Well, I don't know that I have anything to add with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| I like the way Councilman Woodhull laid it out in terms of specifics, and I think I agree with Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| I think we need to establish that that's the way we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| I think we know we've got a good enough feel for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| It's not real complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| It's not rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| I think we've got a pretty good idea of how that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| So I think we ought to go ahead and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| All to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Well, I guess my only thought was, is it necessary to wait two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| We've been about a week into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| I guess I'm concerned about the number of applicants we might have, considerations we might have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| and whether we would need a second opportunity to hear those who wanted to put their name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1841)|
| 0:30:51| So that being the thought, I just wondered if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| I don't know, Mr. Swanson, how long actually it takes to go through that kind of a process with public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1855)|
| 0:31:05| and setting up a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Can we do it in ten days or is it going to take two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| That depends on how prepared the folks are to make decisions and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| We've got the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| And what I've heard suggested is a two-week deadline from today to get your information into the council office to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| express your interest and to let everybody know that you're expressing interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| You have a cutoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| That would be the 17th of February if you had a two-week from today deadline for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| We have a city council workshop day on the 19th that could be utilized to have public information session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1901)|
| 0:31:51| with council on that occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| That would be kind of a natural time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| And then if you wanted to simply schedule the selection of the sixth district representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| on the regular scheduled meeting of the 24th, you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| That would be kind of a natural time schedule that would fit within your workshop schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| and give people a full two weeks to make a decision as to whether they want to throw their hat in the ring or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| and then get the information to the city council office and let the city council office then distribute all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| You do need a couple of days after your cutoff to make sure that everything that has come in is able to be distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| to you and you've had an opportunity to look through it and feel comfortable with your knowledge of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| So that's why I'm thinking maybe the cutoff on 17th and then meeting on 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| But you can do it any way you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| This is just suggestions in terms of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Well, I guess then the follow-up question to your comments would be then the selection of the vice mayor could occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1966)|
| 0:32:54| What would be your thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| At any time after the 24th, if your motion is adopted to wait until the person is elected on the 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1976)|
| 0:33:09| and if that happened on the 24th, then you could either schedule it that night subsequent to that vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| or you could defer it until a later time, either at a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| or at the next regularly scheduled meeting of, let's see, the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| Then it would be the 10th, I think, of March would be your next regularly scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| So whatever way you wanted to do it in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| I just thought we ought to give the whole picture a thought while we're considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| That seems to take it out almost six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Well, if you took it all the way to the 10th, isn't that a little longer than six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| How long is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| One, two, three, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| One, two, three, four, five, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Is it seven or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Well, actually, it's just four weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| It's a short month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Seven weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Until the 10th of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Today until the 10th of March would be how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| It is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| That's a funny March count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| So we have five district representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| If you follow Mr. Holquist's suggestion to do one a week, you would have five district representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| We don't have a six district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| The at-large representatives are then left out in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| So you all decide how you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Councilwoman Roddy was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Mr. Swanson and Mrs. Pillow were speaking to some of the things I was thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| and that's obviously we have this beer board workshop coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Mr. Woodhull mentioned, and I hadn't thought of this, of having the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| when the declared candidates are interviewed, wherever that might take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| and then voting on that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| And I had, you know, assumed, as Mr. Swanson was saying, that we would vote later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| I really like the idea of bringing those candidates forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| and then voting that night before there's a chance for a whole lot more lobbying and whatever to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| I feel like the information that I will gain from those candidates based on their resumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| and their presentation that evening should be sufficient to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| So I would put forth that we might consider interviewing the candidates on the workshop date of the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2123)|
| 0:35:33| selecting a sixth district candidate, and then electing a vice mayor with that new sixth district representative on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| at the regular scheduled council meeting on the 24th at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| And then it would all be accomplished, you know, even within the 30 days, within the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Well, I could see that kind of a schedule working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| We could even have a special call council meeting at the end of the workshop on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| I mean, we do have some flexibility there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| I think I tend to lean more towards making those decisions on the 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| having the workshop on the 19th and making the decisions on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| I can see that working in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| We don't draw it out too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| But, again, I wouldn't object to going on to the 10th of March if everyone else thought that was better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| but I can see it working on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| I think Councilman Frost was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I'm fine with, you know, whatever the suggestions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| I would respectfully submit that the folks who turn in their resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| that the city's webmaster puts them on the city website and at the city council section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| so the public can readily, you know, have access to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| And then hopefully, you know, when that workshop's held or when the meeting's held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| it's not on a traditional mic, that it will be broadcast on CTV for the public to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Well, I really don't have a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Really, it doesn't matter either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| I think both ways would possibly work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I do have a tendency, though, to lean more toward Councilman Roddy's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| to where we have all the people interview on the workshop night, I think it's the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| and then actually vote and select that replacement for the sixth district on that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| and then elect the vice mayor on the following Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| On the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| So on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| I'm just going to throw a personal monkey wrench into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| As many of you all know, I am engaged to a woman who lives way too far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| We have no visible proof of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Hey, plenty of people around here do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| I mean, you've missed the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| One of the challenges, of course, of a relationship at that distance is driving up on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| and back on Sunday doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| So I occasionally have to be gone on nights of important events, and I will be in Richmond on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| And while I am quite willing to miss that, I would like to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| and I hope we can talk about dates and a way to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| Well, can I just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| We have something every week, so I just have to pick occasionally missing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| I just need to follow up and tell you that my husband could not be here because he is in a very important meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| at Hiawassee College tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| But we were going to be in Florida that week, and so the whole week is a monkey wrench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| And so you all may have to take me in because I may not have a place to go if we don't get to go to Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| for the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| But I understood that when we were discussing, we have been putting this off since last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| so I don't know what another couple of weeks would mean to the Pelos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| But anyway, I have a similar concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| I'm not engaged, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| I have a husband who's very tied down situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| And much closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| But I do understand, and I'm sure everyone would be happy to make some kind of shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| some kind of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Councilwoman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| For you, not for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| So are you saying you're not going to be able to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| You will be able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Are you talking to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Yes, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| I'm saying that this was my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| And I am so convicted about the importance that I will somehow be able to communicate that to my husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| And in Councilwoman Becker's situation, his fiancee is more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| Well, I feel that that's a little more tenuous than the situation that I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| She may be watching on the web.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Somehow you all would support me and explain to my husband that, once again, we are not going to have the vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2387)|
| 0:39:56| Let me just say, and I might need affidavits from you all, but in answer to Mr. Woodall's question, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| she is more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Good call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| That is the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| This doesn't speak to the calendar, but it does speak a little bit to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| And that is, Councilman Holquist, in his remarks, alluded to the fact that if we were to elect a sixth district representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| following the public meeting, whenever that might take place, that we would then need to convene as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| since we don't vote at workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| And I am wondering if we could also swear in that representative after that person's election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| simply because the Sunshine Law says, the Open Meetings Law says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| that we cannot communicate when all of us are sworn in as representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| And if we somehow wait for that selected person who's voted on by this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| there's just the possibility that communication could exist, which I don't think would be helpful to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| And others have alluded, I mean, Mr. Becker alluded to the fact that we really want to protect that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| and all of us in terms of the integrity of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| And so I would like to ensure, you know, no matter how long after the sixth district representative is appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2463)|
| 0:41:11| if the vice mayor's election is following that, that the integrity of our process is still very much at the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Right now, the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Go ahead, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Well, I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| The county commission has certainly done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| I've seen it happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| We don't want to do everything the county commission has done, but that seems to be a legitimate action on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| I'm wondering if the judicial commissioner suffices to swear somebody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Right now, the motion is to consider the sixth district first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| So the process questions we're talking about right now are not part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| So I'm going to go ahead and vote on the motion, and then we can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Obviously, there's some issues with Councilman Becker and Councilwoman Pillow that we'll have to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| Yeah, I'm never listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| No, because there's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Oh, because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| It's to select sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| The motion is to select the sixth district council member prior to considering the issue of vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| And I don't think you have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I was asking if it had to be something had to be postponed to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| So right now, the only question is that the one before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| We're going to you're going to decide on the sixth district rep first before you elect the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| The procedures for how we do that are still left up in the air to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Now, so right now then we're back to just that one agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Would you like to discuss that more tonight to try to whittle down that process while we're all together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| Councilman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| I guess, you know, the restriction that we have is that I believe Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| and I spoke to Ms. Mitchell this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| This has to be completed by Monday, the second of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| So looking at the first page on our calendar, we basically have the dates that are in front of us through Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| the 27th of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| We could jump forward to that Monday, the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| But to accomplish the appointment of the sixth district representative, we have to find a way to take applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| have a cutoff, have a time space when those applications can be distributed to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| and then some kind of public meeting session when those candidates can be interviewed before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| and including the second of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| So really it's until Friday, the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| I mean, that's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Let me, since I'm causing the problem, let me suggest a couple options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| One is you do it on the 19th and I'm not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| And if we do the interview then and the vote later, well, I don't like that one either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| But I'm tossing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| The other possibility we have is that the, and this is not good for timing, is to do the interviews on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| We could actually move the deadline for getting the resumes in a little bit, do the interviews on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| That doesn't help you, though, Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| I would say Monday, the 23rd is a possible date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| Unfortunately, I know that there's a significant meeting about the Burlington Library that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| which I don't want to do a conflict with the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| A possibility would be to do something on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| We have beer board already and council potentially do some of the hearing earlier to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2672)|
| 0:44:40| And then there's Thursday, the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| I think Wednesdays are not good nights necessarily, but we could do something on Thursday, the 26th, a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| a hearing or a workshop and a vote that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| It seems like there are options on this which could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| Councilman Hoekstra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Councilman Becker, looking at Tuesday, the 17th, it looks to me like that might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| TDOT has a meeting on the James White Parkway and alternatives for that project at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| So, you know, if we held it at our regular 7 p.m. time, I don't see a conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| It seems to me like that may be an alternative workable date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| And Councilman Pelo, I hear making a commitment because she initiated this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| However, I was hoping I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Did you ever want to just cut the baby in two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| And I was thinking, well, you know, I can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| We just won't stay as long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| But, of course, the 17th would mean we couldn't go at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| I'm just trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| I will do what's best for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Councilman Becker here and hopefully you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And I'm just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Well, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Couldn't we just go ahead and make a determination and have them next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| Toward the end of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Resumes next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| And have the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Wednesday, Thursday, something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| I mean, I don't know that you really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Most people that are probably interested in this position have a pretty good inclination as to whether they're interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| in doing it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| And so, they probably could get something together, get it to us if we wanted to have it on Thursday, next Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| and have something to us by Tuesday or something like that a week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| And then let's have it Thursday and then both of you all are in town, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| I'm going to go to Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| I'm sorry I'm not sure of the order, but go ahead, Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| I should say on Tuesday the 17th I will be in Nashville that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| So, I mean, that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Yeah, I think I like Councilman Hall's suggestion the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| The 24th that Councilman Becker suggested and starting earlier in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| I'm just really sensitive to folks' schedules, both who want to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| and both who are interested district members in this process not being available until after the workday has ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| So, I really feel that it's important that this process take place, you know, after 5 o'clock in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| But, you know, if we feel like we can get something out and have resumes due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| I think Mr. Hall's suggestion was a week from today, which is Tuesday the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| We do have a council meeting that night and then get the information to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| and convene on Thursday evening the 12th, assuming we can find an appropriate place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| I like Councilman Frost's idea that it be publicized for those folks who can't get out at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| particularly in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| That may limit how much we can go into a church or a school in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| I don't know what the capabilities are of CTV of bringing that technology out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| But, you know, microphones are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| and we want to make sure that it's conducted in such a way that everyone can hear who attends the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| and anyone who watches on television can also hear because there will be people who are very interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| who may not be able to attend at night in the cold or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| If we do that, then, well, I guess we need to decide on that first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| and then figure out when we would try to elect a vice mayor after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Yeah, I guess my tendency would be to take longer and make the decision a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| I'm not going to put up much of a fight because I'm causing the problem in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| And I guess I don't know if they're listening up in the CTV booth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| but do you all have any idea of how hard it is to get something set up for a location someplace else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2912)|
| 0:48:41| Remote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| We're actually going to get spoken to from the booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| To do it live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| And this is the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| CTV can't do a live broadcast outside of this building, can they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| Yes, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| And we used to meet and have council meetings, but they were not live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| They weren't live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Councilman Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Well, Councilman Becker and everyone else, based on that, this is not in the heart of the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2951)|
| 0:49:19| but the 6th District is probably the most gerrymandered district of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| It extends pretty far to the west, et cetera, and this is central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| It's got great transit access because of the hub right outside the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| The CTV is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| So it makes sense to have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| And I can see doing it on the 12th if this space is available on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| MPC meets that day beginning at 130, depending on when they're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| So if we scheduled it for 7, good chance that no one else is in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| Yeah, and nobody else wanted the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| There's a good chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| MPC has so much on consent these days on their agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| Well, have you seen the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| It's only about three pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| Yeah, and it's small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| I received mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| So good chance that we could do it even perhaps earlier than 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| So I think that that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| I understand Councilman Becker wanting to have some time, but Councilman Pelos' comment that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| even though this is happening suddenly, you know, people are responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| I think it's up to those folks and up to the people who would like to find somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| if they're not satisfied with those that have stepped forward so far, to just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| to get out there and make sure that people put their name in the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| No other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| There's really nothing else for us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| We just need to come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| So Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| I was asking Mr. Hall if he wanted to make a motion based on his proposed schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| Yes, I want to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| I have a little bit more of what that motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Then we make a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| You're not for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| You can't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| For all the people that are interested in the position in the 6th District to have their resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| applications, or whatever you want to refer to them as, to the council office by the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| So before 5 o'clock or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Does that affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| 5 o'clock deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| So that way they could, in all probability, give them to us at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| And then let's have a meeting to interview those individuals on the 12th and to actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3092)|
| 0:51:42| for it to be a special council meeting because we'll, at the end of this meeting, we'll vote and select somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| Councilman Hall, what if we made it 3 o'clock so that just in case copies had to be made, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| preparing for council meeting, give staff a little bit more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Right now the motion is that we would have a deadline of 3 p.m. on the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| which is next Tuesday for all applications to be in to the council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| Then the special called meeting of council would be on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| And I think we said we would do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| Was that part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| If we can, assuming we can, at 6 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Will everybody be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I'm seeing all nods from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| It's Thursday at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| That was the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Is there a second to all of that, Ms. Rodney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| I will second all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| And I believe the motion included that there would be a called council meeting following the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| or the public hearing part and anticipate making arrangements to swear in that district representative at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3164)|
| 0:52:53| There is a reception that all elected officials are invited to at Iams Nature Center that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| Obviously, I think this probably takes precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| And I apologize to them publicly that we need to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| But I think it's very important that all of us be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| And we want to accommodate everybody's calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Yeah, that was the reason I had my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| As Councilman Rodney mentioned, the Iams reception, it's really focused on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| and county commission primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| They've had to reschedule it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| I hate to make them do it again, but I think this is priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I guess a clarification point on how people apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| And, again, I don't want to get into some technical, well, your application wasn't good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| My sense is if people want to apply, they let us know they're applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| And then they're on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| It's not anything where you have to have a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| My assumption is people who are interested are going to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| But we're not going to eliminate people because they just sort of e-mailed in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| put my name on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| And does that feel good to folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| I mean, if they just say that they want to be there and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| So whatever somebody's name decides, they are a potential candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| And they show up when we have our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| I think the key is the 3 o'clock deadline means people have to have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| If somebody has contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| What you said, if the name is on the list by 3 o'clock, the name is on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| And the list can be created if I phoned in, e-mailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| It's not a resume thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| You really need a written expression of intent would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Written expression of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| To be clear, it's a written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| You could send an e-mail and not get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| Excuse me for out of order, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Mayor, question along these lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| What is the criteria, Mr. Swanson, to be eligible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Whatever you decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Oh, you mean the criteria for the council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| They have to live within the district for a year, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| What do we need to do to verify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| I think they have to be a certain age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Well, they do have to be a certain age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| It has to be 21 or above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| How do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Let me look it up right quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| How do we go about verifying that before we know who we can vote on these folks based on their eligibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3296)|
| 0:55:05| As bald as I am, they're over 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| I mean, I'm sure we've got to check their address or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| You haven't looked at all the swimmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| I've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| I guess we can verify their addresses once they're submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| I wondered about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| Make them submit a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Well, I did have a question and maybe a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| I think we need to have some rules regarding the length of time someone can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Are we going to have a question period or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| You know, just some little details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Council can set its policies that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| I mean, the prior discussion, well, I guess we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3343)|
| 0:55:51| That night, we'll have to come with those proposals that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| I think it's probably the clearest way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| That night instead of deciding now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| Sounds like we need a vice mayor for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| It just seems that if you were going to make a presentation, you would like to know how to prepare it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| If they knew ahead of time, it might be very helpful to those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| I agree with Ms. Pelow that we kind of need to decide those things beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| I actually agree with Mr. Hall that it would be great to have a vice mayor to decide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| but we're going to do it as a team, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Would you like to make a proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Would anybody like to make a proposal on the limits, what we're going to instruct candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| I was going to simply propose the general rules of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| A person has up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| And if, unlike public forum, if folks want to ask questions, folks in council, the administration, want to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3401)|
| 0:56:49| there can be a question time then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| There wouldn't be a rebuttal or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| It's just, you know, five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Most folks might not need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| The council asks questions and then move on to the next candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Councilman Rodney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| I think to protect Ms. Mitchell and the staff in our office, it might be helpful to them if we are very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| that, first of all, the application needs to be in some kind of written form, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| either a letter that is submitted to the office or there's a sign-up sheet where you just write your name down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| you know, that council keeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| I think verification of their address somehow at that juncture would probably help the council staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| so that applicants aren't distributed to us inadvertently who don't reside in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| And that could be a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Driver's license would be age also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| You know, it would show the age and it would also show the legal address of that applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| so that we're certain on the front end that we're only considering folks who are eligible under our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| My other comment, Mr. Mayor, was would you be willing to ask our web mistress to make sure that as much of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| as possible is on the city council website as soon as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| We'll make sure it gets a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| The calendar, the dates, and the application process, telephone numbers for questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| location of the final meetings, and not only linked on the city council page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| but, you know, maybe if there is something right on the home page, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| on the banner page so that folks who need that information can access it very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Are we still in the process of clarifying Councilman Hall's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| Well, I guess actually we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| We didn't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| I think maybe we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| And part of that, we came to the process of what are we going to ask people to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| And right now what's on the floor is the five-minute presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| The five-minute presentation, and I assume what you mean for us is people get five minutes to present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| and then questions are on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Oh, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Yeah, you don't get two minutes and three minutes of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| And I guess the other side that has two questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| I sort of recommend that the order be determined by drawing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| It's at some level of whoever gets to go first is not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| that we decide how that's done in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| So if there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Well, you know, that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| I mean, but we have to have some level of determining what order people go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| And I think there's also the question of who's running that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| And I don't know if the mayor is planning to do that or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| I have some questions to whether I can be here that whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| So council might want to make to think about how they want to run it in case I can't be here the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| Me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Judge Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| What was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| There's some chance I can't be here the whole time on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| So they would select among their numbers someone to chair the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Mr. Bailey, I actually learned how to work my computer now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| and I can give you the qualifications for a council member if you're still interested in that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Each council member shall have been a resident of the city of Knoxville for one year prior to taking office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| and shall continue to reside therein during the term of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| shall be at least 21 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| No person shall be eligible to serve in the office of council member who holds any other elective public office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| or who is a city of Knoxville employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| District council members must reside in their districts for one year prior to taking office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| and shall continue to live therein during the period of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| There's some other things that really don't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Councilwoman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Do we have a concern about verifying the one-year residency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| or do we just assume that folks, I mean, that's going to be really tough to ascertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3644)|
| 1:00:51| I think you're just going to have to get them to attest that that's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| And then if you find out that that's not the truth, then you may have to take some action to eject them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| I mean, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| I'd go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| The other question was procedurally during this interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| Councilman Frost suggested a five-minute time limit for each candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| And then was there also a suggestion, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| of the amount of time that council could spend asking questions on each candidate so that we're fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| I mean, do you do five minutes of presentation and five minutes of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| You know, some people might be more familiar with a candidate or less familiar with some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| You know, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Thankfully, this isn't a process we go through very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| So I don't mean to say it would be unlimited question time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| Of course, there's got to be a limit to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| But, you know, council, you know, would just ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| And if it took one minute, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| If it took five minutes, you know, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| It's just, you know, I'm sure all of council would be, you know, use good discretion in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| I was just trying to clarify your intent, again, to avoid giving unfair advantage to any one council candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| Even in a question-answer period, the candidate is still in a position to present themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| And so that, you know, that presentation continues if you don't limit that somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| So I guess I'd be more comfortable with a limited presentation period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| and also a limited question period with maybe some time at the very end after all members have presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| if council has some addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| The problem I see with limiting the question-and-answer period is because I may know one candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3756)|
| 1:02:44| and I don't feel I need to ask her a question, but I may need to ask the next candidate a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| And if you and Councilman Frost have took up that five minutes, I don't get my question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| You see, I don't really think you should put a time limit on the question-and-answer session with council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| I'm not sure we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| I'm not sure we can limit the we can cut off a council member and not let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| And get the council from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Ms. Hall, something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| Well, the other thing is I do think one thing before we get before we conclude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| we do need to address the method of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| And I think Mr. Swanson, you know, mentioned two that are very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| But I do think we need to determine that today probably so that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| For the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| For the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| That's a good thought, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| We do need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| I was going to say one of the advantages we'll have is we do have a council meeting on the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| and we will know by then how many applicants there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| So a little bit of this question that Ms. Rowdy is getting at is sort of how long it can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| If we have two applicants, it doesn't become much of a worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| If we have 13, that becomes much more of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| And even the scheduling at some level, if we have 13 candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| who gets to speak when becomes important because by the end of that some of us are pretty exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| So I'm going to suggest we actually pick up this question again on the agenda on the 10th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| and just finalize things of being clear what we're doing on the 12th on the 10th as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| Did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Steve, you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| I think you did, but it sort of gives, it sort of doesn't let the candidates have much time to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| I mean, they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| I mean, I think what we're clear on is it's a five-minute presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| And I think what we're aiming for is I like the idea of unlimited question time because we do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| know different things about different people and we can talk on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| And we can revisit that at the council meeting and change things if we do have just too many applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| If we have 25 applicants, that's a process that probably won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| And we might need to rethink it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| But I hear what you're saying and I don't want to get away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| But unlimited question time with 25 candidates might be unworkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Let me suggest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| I was going to say we should talk to Steve's question on how we vote because we're going to vote on the 12th as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| And I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| We need to be very up front with the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Here's how the decision gets made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Mr. Swanson's idea actually of where all the names are put in nomination all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| and then you start eliminating the person who has the least number of votes is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| there's historical precedence for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| That might be a good way to go for this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Will these be voice votes or will they just be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| I think that's another decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| I think actually it's actually technically it's the whoever's in the chair's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| I would recommend it just be roll call because of the importance of it and getting everything on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| And that helps people get a sense of who should rotate, how you should rotate off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| I think, you know, a roll call vote, but for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| if you have three candidates named Jones, Smith, and Wilson, that the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3971)|
| 1:06:21| or excuse me, the council members say the person they want, they vote for the person they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| Then when that's tabulated, the lowest vote getter is dropped from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| and then the pool has been narrowed, and then we vote again with the same thing with each person saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| I want Smith, Jones, or Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| The difference there being you have to end up with a total of six because you've got to have six council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| to elect a council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| It's just five for the vice mayor's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| I understand that, but I was trying to suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| Councilman Huqquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Going back to the question and answer period and the discussion of the person making their presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| and the question and answer, before the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| will there be a mechanism for the public attending the meeting to have input before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| And is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Well, if you do, now you're opening, well, sorry, that's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| I know it's potentially a can of worms, but I think some people might be interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| and so I think we just need to say, yeah, we think it's a good idea, or no, we don't think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| Council's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| I don't know what you were about to say, Mayor Haslund, but, yeah, I think it opens just a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| I think we need to be, this is council's responsibility to make this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| and I think we need to be prepared to come to listen and carefully consider what's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| and that means we do our homework before we come in terms of evaluating these resumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| and these candidates' views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| And, you know, I really feel it needs to be council's meeting and the candidates' meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| That's just my personal thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Yeah, and let me, I know Councilman Becker wanted to say something, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Let me just respond to what Councilman Pillow said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| I tend to lean in that direction, too, and I think because there's a cutoff deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| because all this information is going to be posted on the Web, anyone that's tracking it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| and interested will be able to garner anything except what is said at the meeting itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| And, you know, they can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| And if we all have our computers or our cell phones and they want to text us or e-mail us, that's their prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| But I tend to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| I think it would be kind of messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| You know, it's an interesting question, Joe, and I hadn't even thought of that, and I'm glad you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| I actually think that at some point, and I don't know how we work this, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| it feels like saying, well, we're going to elect the 6th District representative without hearing from anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| from the 6th District is a little funky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| Process-wise, it makes it hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| If we have a lot of candidates, how do we get input from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| But I don't know that I want to sit up here and just listen to folks who want to represent the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| without having a chance for anybody from the 6th District to tell me what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| And it's a confusing one that I had not thought of before, but I don't think that's a simple answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| Let me just say that the only reason I brought it up, I hadn't thought of it either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| but a constituent just contacted me who's watching on TV and said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| You know, what about us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| What about the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| Well, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| That's why I thought it was at least appropriate to honor them and bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Well, I would just respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Surely you all, as have I this week, had numerous phone calls, e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| and various types of messages indicating support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| or against a particular candidate for the vice mayor position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| So I would assume that we'd be hearing from those individuals who have placed their name in contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| But I just feel that we will have a lot of input prior to even arriving for the interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| Now, you can correct me if you feel I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| You know, I was actually involved the last time council did this, when Danny Mayfield died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| And I can picture it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| I don't know if anybody else was here that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| But if you had said to folks that night, I'm sorry, we're not going to listen to the public, there would be bloodshed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| And I don't think we're going to be at that point for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| But it does not feel good to me to say, no, the public is not allowed to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| It feels like we've got to say some level of the meeting on the 12th has a period in there where there is public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| Do we need a time for that, whether it's, you know, a half an hour like we would do public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| whether it's a time for people to comment on each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| We could even do something of we're going to get it down to three candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| and we're going to allow the public, you know, more input on those three that we need public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Based on all this, maybe we need to select the vice mayor first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| You know, we always have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| And I think we probably ought to have a vote on council here if we want to have a public forum before the meeting starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| Or just after the candidates go through their presentation and their question and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| And after that, we'll have a public forum and we can have a 30-minute time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| And based on how many people show up, we'll divvy out the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| Or there's just three or four people, we'll give them, you know, the normal five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| But we ought to just vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| I'll make the motion that whether we have a to have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| Actually, excuse me, there is a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Cindy just recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| So we'll have to maybe come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Is that an amendment to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| What is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| The motion on the floor is Steve's original one about deadline of the 10th, meeting on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| That right now is encompassing a five-minute talk time for each candidate as well as question and answers on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| I think we ought to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| So I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Well, you could make yours an amendment to his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| I'd like to just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Councilman Bailey would like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| You're calling the question on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| On voting now on Steve Hall's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Let me just see if I can encapsulate Steve and Marilyn, the second you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| Deadline applications and that just be in written form by 3 p.m. on the 10th to council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| Meeting on the 12th at 6 o'clock, at which time all the candidates would have five minutes to make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| Does not include questions that would come from council at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| Right now, that's the motion as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| Does not have, is not addressed, not saying you can or cannot do public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| It would be a special meeting that night as well and swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| A special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| And does it also include Rob's voting process or is that not included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| Well, I think council can decide that at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| But Mr. Swanson, you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| I didn't really hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Rob's voting process of we're going to do the thing where all the nominations out there will have the votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| and then eliminate the least amount of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| That's not a part of this motion as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| And you can decide that at that point if you want to or you can decide it now if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| But there's no reason why you have to decide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| Why don't we vote on my motion first and then take these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| Since the question has been called, I think we should go ahead and do that as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| Under Robert's rules, to call the question, you have to actually have a vote, don't you, to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| I don't see that we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| I mean, I'm turning my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| There is a light on, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| All those in favor of calling the question now, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| I heard two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| So six ayes and two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| And that means that we are going to vote on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| So that means there's no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| We're voting on the motion as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| I'll make sure I got all this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| I heard eight ayes and no noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Ms. Roddy has a light still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| I guess I would like to make a motion addressing public input from residents of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| And I guess this needs to be in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| I would like to allow at that meeting, following the five-minute presentation and the unlimited questioning time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| that there be a time of public forum of 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| We have a tradition of continuing that public forum when we feel like the public has not had a chance to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| so that residents of the 6th District can speak to the candidates that have been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| I just think we can't consider this without considering the voices of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4519)|
| 1:15:19| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| I would just like a little clarifying information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Thirty minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| You could have one speaker do 30 minutes, and then you'd be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Well, help me rephrase that, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| I'd like to allow a time of public forum for the public to speak, like similar to what we do at the end of a council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| where folks from the 6th District can speak to the candidates that have nominated themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| The minutes are equitably distributed to the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| If we're setting it for 30, if you're suggesting 30 minutes, I don't know how you can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| because you don't know how many candidates there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| If there are 45 candidates, that means 12 seconds each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| But if there are three candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| How about a maximum of 30 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| A maximum of 30 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| For whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| For everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| For the entire period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| I mean, I'm thinking out loud here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| For the entire period of public input from residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| And so that would include that whatever the total number of candidates, it would be divided by 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| and your speakers could speak for if there's 15, everybody gets two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| Et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Or if there's two, everybody gets 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| Is that the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| You know, I'm thinking out loud here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| You limit it to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Five minutes of public comment per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| No, per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| There's public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| let's get back in order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| That's too drastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| So you could potentially have 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| As a candidate, I could have ten people come to speak for me, all of whom would get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Well, but there's limited to 30 minutes total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| So however many people, it's like we always do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| We put a limit on it of 30 minutes, and then however many people show up, we divide the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| No, however many candidates there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Is that what you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| Oh, this is the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| I know, but so if I get my ten speakers to come speak, they take the whole 30 minutes if I'm a candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| and that could easily happen if a candidate gets real organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| So we would do what we always do is we suspend the rules to give people more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| I mean, I think what Ms. Roddy is saying is we're doing this the way we usually do public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| And frankly, what our tradition has been is we're going to listen to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| And it could take a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| If I could, the only difference is in public forum, you're not necessarily there to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| Here you're letting people advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| And so you could be there for hours and hours under that scenario you just proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| If you're going to let 30 minutes and anybody who didn't get to speak, it's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| Let me amend my motion with the permission of whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| There were several seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| And that is that each candidate who is present that night be allowed a certain number of minutes of public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4671)|
| 1:18:01| for the public to comment, be it five or be it ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| And if, you know, if as a candidate I bring 15 people to advocate for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| then they're going to have to decide among themselves or fit their comments into what that limit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| I'll say ten minutes per candidate of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| I have a suggestion that beforehand we make sure that we of course we're going to have the total list of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4699)|
| 1:18:27| We have one sheet for each candidate and a list, a series of lines that people can sign up prior to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| where they want to speak for that candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| And then we decide at the beginning of the council meeting, based on what we have in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| the number of candidates and the number of people who want to speak on behalf of each candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| we decide how we want to break it down and how much time we want to allocate, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| We make the decision then rather than now because we don't know yet what that's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| So you're saying we'd make the decision the night of the council, on the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| once you know how many people have signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| We'll know the number of candidates and we'll say you've got to sign up to speak in favor of a specific candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| We'll know for each candidate how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| And then we can decide how to process it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| Yeah, there is a motion on the floor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| I actually heard several seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| I thought I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Yeah, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| It was a different motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| It was a different motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| I amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| I changed my motion to set a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| I had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Mr. Becker then seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| And your amendment was to set a time limit of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Ten minutes per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Ten minutes per candidate of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| So we're discussing that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Councilman Holquist suggested it might be better just to decide all this once we knew the exact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| because then you know exactly what the logistical issues you're dealing with are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Councilman Bailey and then I'll go to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Actually, I think this can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| And the assumption is people will be speaking to candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| I think actually deciding now what the rules are before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| and then I think what we could do is amend the rules if there are far fewer people showing we can be flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4814)|
| 1:20:21| like we always are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| I guess I have one sort of minor concern on your original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| I don't know if this played over into the following one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| You said for residents of the sixth district to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| And I think we've got to be a little cautious because we do represent everybody even though it's a sixth district seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| So I want to be clear that we're not any limited people in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Out of respect for this minute, I understand what Councilman Holquist is saying about deciding the night of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| I kind of think of the idea of when we leave here tonight, the ground rules are laid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| so people know what they're applying for, what the process is, if they can have a speaker in support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| how long the speaker can be versus, you know, if we get to the situation where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| we have two people or we have 20 people, then they need to know if they need to bring someone in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| if they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| I hear what he's saying, but I think the ground rules, most of them need to be laid down tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| Well, they would still, if you did it on the, okay, I was saying you could probably, after the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4886)|
| 1:21:34| have a chance to then get once Council decides to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| But, again, it's Council's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| You can do it however you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| Anybody else want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| I have a tendency to agree with Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| I think we need to determine what it's going to be that whoever these potential candidates are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| they know what they're going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Right now, Ms. Roddy's motion is ten minutes of speaker of per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4916)|
| 1:22:04| No, ten minutes per candidate, whatever that ends up being, regardless of the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| Ms. Peelum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| I think one other reason for deciding tonight, it's important, is for everyone to understand what we're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| Because sometimes that can be misunderstood in a very passionate period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| when someone is wanting very much to advocate for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| So, if we have the rules established tonight, then everyone is very clear on what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| how Council wanted to offer an opportunity for people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| I mean, I have real concerns about this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| I won't vote against the public forum because I support public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| But under these conditions, it really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| You know, I'm a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| I was once upon a time a candidate with six other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| And I have to tell you, it can get to be where we can all be worn out, including the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| So, you know, I think some of the caution that Mayor Haslam started with initially, I think I feel, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| But I will support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| But I think it's important, too, for people to understand that we have laid the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| And we're going to live by our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| And it has nothing to do with the individuals before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| It has to do with the policy that we've set up for how we're going to run the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| When I think of public forum, I think of where we have people from the public generally come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| and they talk broadly about an issue or about, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| I was thinking about what they want to see in their candidate or in their council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| But I think what we're talking about when you allow ten minutes is sort of a campaign forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| I would like to see maybe something in the way of a time limit on introductions of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| Maybe you have three one-minute introductions or you allow a candidate five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| And whoever wants to come on behalf of that candidate can come and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| and introduce them prior to their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| And I'd like to see if council sees something along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| rather than allowing people to go recruit people from the community to come in there and stand up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| and basically campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| I mean, I think we just want to kind of look at resumes and we'll all have our own criteria in our mind of what we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| And we want to listen to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| But I think that's probably the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| And let me say this, public forum started when Mark resigned with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| I've had lots and lots of calls already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| And I'm sure that's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| So I just think we ought to maybe say five-minute introduction or three one-minute introductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| by whoever you want to bring with you, and then your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| I'd like to see what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Well, actually, we have a different motion on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| So that obviously you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| Well, let me just say, because I can see where some people are highly qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| and they don't, you know, want to go out here and bring a bunch of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| they don't know enough people to come in there that want to get up and feel comfortable and, you know, at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| And others have already had dozens of people call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| So I just think it's not what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| I think it would be better just to kind of have an introduction process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| And we'll listen to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| But we can vote on this, whatever we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| I guess we do have a motion on the floor already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| I guess I think as council members, I think we're astute enough to be able to sift through, you know, a campaign kind of lobby process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5150)|
| 1:26:02| I think if we have qualified candidates that don't bring a retinue, that hopefully we can discern that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| My concern with the idea of the introduction process is it doesn't allow candor from members of the public who wish to speak to all aspects of all candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5169)|
| 1:26:25| You confine the public forum to a positive kind of introduction thing and maybe curtail other pieces of comment that folks might feel inclined to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5185)|
| 1:26:41| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| And Ms. Roddy, is your sense, if I show up and I know there are three people that are good candidates and one guy who doesn't live in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5202)|
| 1:26:54| and I want to bring that up and something else, what we've got now is signing up by candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| So potentially, where does something like that that is not I am pro or con on this candidate, is it sort of you just sign up for one of them and say your piece kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5219)|
| 1:27:10| I'm trying to get at, because I think Mr. Bailey's got an interesting point of, and you do as well, of how we get some of the broader thinking in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5230)|
| 1:27:19| And I'm wondering what your thought is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| Are you asking that during the ten minutes for each candidate, I would say that comments are limited to input on that candidate, whatever you want to bring forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5241)|
| 1:27:35| And I guess I didn't see members of the public being limited to commenting in only one ten-minute time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| If someone wants to make a comment about Candidate Smith and Candidate Jones and Candidate Williams, then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5262)|
| 1:27:51| They could sign up for all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| They could sign up for all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| And like you say, we're astute enough that if they have, we could potentially say, let's, you know, let's, we could, but probably if the rules are set, we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5273)|
| 1:28:04| Well, you set rules to have the base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| All right, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Mr. Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Right now, then, the motion on the floor, Ms. Wright, just to make sure I'm clear, is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| At the end of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| Presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Presentations and the council questioning, then there will be a period of public forum that will be limited to ten minutes per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5301)|
| 1:28:29| And folks can sign up, Ms. Mitchell, ahead of time with you to speak during that ten-minute period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5309)|
| 1:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| And then we would take everything else on the other motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| And could we also limit the sign-ups to when they're present here that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| Because we'll have people start calling in, try to get the jump start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| So we'll just sign in candidates or public forum speakers that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| That night, I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| If you're signing up for Candidate Jones and Candidate Jones has three people they want to speak on their behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5340)|
| 1:29:10| what happens if Candidate Smith has people call in and really say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5350)|
| 1:29:18| I want to talk about Candidate Jones and stops the other people from signing up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| You know, I mean, that's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| I think council, whoever's moderating can, well, that's the chair's job just to ferret out and say, well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| But, you know, you're, somebody's just going to have to make that call who's chairing the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| I think that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| Let me, the follow-up to Rob's is an interesting thing is if I know that Candidate Jones is a bad candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5380)|
| 1:29:49| that's got to be on there someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| So are we saying that the sign-ups are only positives or, and, again, it does fall under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| this is a very interesting question because at some level we, I don't think it's fair to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| if I know Candidate Jones actually doesn't meet the qualifications, I don't get a chance to speak because I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| and, again, that would open things up to saying, well, Candidate Smith just takes all of Candidate Jones' times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5407)|
| 1:30:23| I'm not solving anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| I think valid comments that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Right now there's a motion on the floor, no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Could we do right now what's structured is a 10 minutes on each candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| Would it be helpful to have another 10-minute slot that's just other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| You know, general, here's what I think candidates be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| Does that feel like, I mean, it lengthens time, but it also could be a place where it could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| And I think getting the rules set beforehand is a good thing, and that's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| If anybody thinks that's an idea, we can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| You know, I guess the problem with any process, it can be manipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| So if somebody comes and takes those 10 minutes and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| Yeah, whoever chairs the meeting is going to have to control it because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| I may want to come and talk against a candidate instead of for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| I may say, well, don't vote for Candidate Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Yeah, the question is under this setup, when do you get to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Do you do it during Candidate Jones' time or do you do it against, I mean, see, it gets real complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| I don't think we've solved the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| Because you're right, it's not like a normal public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| It's not give and take, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| Yeah, it's not a give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| This is something that, you know, people are lobbying us for something that we're going to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| Councilman Hooklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| Obviously, it would have to be during that candidate's time because there's no other way you can't do it out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| another candidate's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| So it sounds like it's first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| They either get somebody speaking for them or they get somebody speaking against them the way we're structured right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| I thought if there were like ten speakers, you divided up one minute each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| But if there are three speakers, you divided up what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Right, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| The only question is this forum is not providing for any method for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| That forum doesn't provide any method for speaking against someone if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| Well, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| Yeah, let them get up there when that candidate comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| If there are 20 speakers, then it's 30 seconds per speaker, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| You could say positive or negative things during that 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| Yeah, in defense of my motion, I think that you sign up to speak to the issue that is on your heart that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5566)|
| 1:32:54| whether it is that you feel strongly that a candidate cannot represent your district well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| or whether you feel strongly that this is the best possible candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| I guess, you know, for me, we've seen this process go poorly in a number of different venues in our history in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5581)|
| 1:33:13| And I think we have to make every opportunity to allow the folks of the 6th District, particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| and folks citywide who will be represented by this councilperson to have a chance to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| And ultimately, as Mr. Kelo said, ultimately it is council's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| But we have got to make this process as accessible to the public as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| I think this is a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| There's an interesting level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Yeah, there are all these ways to manipulate it and you could just do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| And I think in a way we're talking about a city council seat and having served for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| I'd say it would be wonderful if people would really work that hard to manipulate the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| and got all these people out to speak and did all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| Frankly, in a way that would be a good problem to have because we have, you know, this is just city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Rephrase the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Restate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Go ahead, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| My motion is to add to our process in the selection of a 6th District representative a public forum time at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5651)|
| 1:34:20| of the presentation and question and answer process whereby each candidate would be allotted 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5660)|
| 1:34:28| or 10 minutes per candidate would be allotted for public forum, public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| Sign up would take place that night prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| And if the meeting begins at 6, maybe you want to specify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| Ms. Mitchell, would that make it easier for you that we open it up at 530 prior to that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| And I believe what I've heard from my colleagues is that the people who sign up for that 10 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| the time is divided among them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| So if there are 10 people that want to speak during the time allotted for Candidate Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| then each of those people get one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| But somehow I feel this is important to allow that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Everybody ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| I'm just, I have serious reservations about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| I'm not opposed to people being able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Serious reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| I heard seven ayes and, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| I heard seven ayes, so it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| Yeah, I guess I want to make a motion on the process of voting, again, just to be clear on what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| And I think I want to do what Councilman Frost suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| I think the motion is that all the names in nomination are we do a roll call where each council person says the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5744)|
| 1:35:53| name of their person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| If nobody receives a majority, the one who receives the least number of votes is dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| and we vote again until we get six votes because it takes six to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| What 100% of the names are put in nomination at once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| And we vote in the, excuse me, by name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| By name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| So it's roll call and I say jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| That was a motion and a second that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Ms. Peeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Really, we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| I just wanted to be sure that Ms. Mitchell or someone provides us with these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| We will make certain that we state those and we'll try to get those out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| So they're clear to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| The motion is that we will, once all the names are in place and it comes time to vote, all those will be called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| and council will vote who they each individual selects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5802)|
| 1:36:49| and then we will rotate off the person getting the lowest number of votes until somebody gets a total of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| I think there is anything else to come before council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Ms. Rodney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| I think, do we still need to set a date for the election of the vice mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| Or is that, are we postponing that until such time as we want to bring this up again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| Because we don't, I believe, Mr. Swanson, have a 30-day time clock on accomplishing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Although you did speak earlier to the fact that there are responsibilities that might need to be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| I guess I'll just, since I have the floor at the moment, I guess I would put up that perhaps we have that as soon as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| possible after the sixth district representative is added to our body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| Because the week beginning the 16th of February is not a good week for a number of members that we elect the vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| on Tuesday the 24th as an agenda item in our regularly scheduled council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| I thought that's what we had discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| I didn't know that we had voted on that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| We actually have not voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| We just discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Councilman Huckless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| I had something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| That was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Any other comment on Ms. Rodney's motion, which is basically to vote on the, that the selection of the vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| will be on the, at the meeting, the regular scheduled meeting of the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Now, Mr. Huckless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| There was something we talked about earlier, and I'm not sure if we ever really resolved it, and that's who's going to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| fulfill the contemporary role of leading, you know, and Councilman Frost, did you say rotate it weekly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5903)|
| 1:38:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| I mean, do we need that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Do we need somebody to kind of be point on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| How do we want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Do we not need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| I just want to make sure we've covered all of the bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| Chris, he throws them under the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| We worry about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Ms. Pelham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| I'm going to use one of Bob's famous phrases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| It just kind of feels to me like Bob, that surely Ms. Mitchell and Ms. Peters and Ms. Wilson can handle us for a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5930)|
| 1:39:04| I have great confidence in the fact that they will be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| My husband last night was talking about something, and he mentioned trying to herd cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| And he thought that couldn't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Because I believe that they can herd the eight of us into some sort of reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| I'm fine with that if everybody else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| And we've kind of, you know, already sewed up one workshop date and how we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5963)|
| 1:39:30| And our process is clear on this other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| So, you know, should there be something else and we need it, they know where to find us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| I'm going to put my confidence in those ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| That seems to be the sense of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| I see Ms. Cash standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| Anybody else from Council have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| I would just say we could decide who presides at the workshop the night of the workshop somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Like I said, there's a decent chance I won't be here for at least part, if not all, of the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| So you're going to have to make the same decision on the night of the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| I want God to do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I didn't sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| My name is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6011)|
| 1:40:11| I'm the president of the City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| Actually, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| Ms. Mitchell just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| We really aren't allowed to have public forum on special meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| To allow Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| Can we do that, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| If we can, I'll just ask her a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Well, anyway, Mr. Swanson seems to think it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| All those in favor of suspending the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6040)|
| 1:40:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| I didn't realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| As a city employee and as the president representing the general government employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| I just want to help each of you understand the importance that each of you all holds in our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6052)|
| 1:41:00| and the big part you play in each of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| And I came here tonight most interested in how this process was going to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| And I'm not asking to speak for every candidate because I don't think I can speak for every candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| But I just want to ask you where at the process you've designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| and I want to commend you on your willingness to compromise and to reach a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| and set forth your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| But my question to you is, where are the employee representatives supposed to speak in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6090)|
| 1:41:39| to let you know who we want to endorse if we choose to endorse somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| You want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| My understanding is there will be a sign-up sheet for the public forum part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| which will be after the candidates speak and have questions from council, but before we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| in which case people will sign up for candidates, either you speak pro or con.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| So I think if any institution or individual wants to speak for or against a candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6121)|
| 1:42:07| there will be time allotted for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| So it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Ms. Piller, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| We'll go to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| I guess also the candidates, I assume, will be published the two days before after the 3 o'clock deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6136)|
| 1:42:24| and I guess announced that night since we have a council meeting that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| And certainly our e-mail addresses are available for the 48 hours between the cutoff of candidate nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| and then the public forum and vote on Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| So there would be that opportunity for anyone to utilize as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Ms. Piller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Well, actually, Ms. Roddy made the same comment I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| In fact, I encourage that anyone who wishes to convey to us who they're supporting, and certainly the city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6165)|
| 1:42:56| because you know how closely I've worked with the employees over the years, I would like to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Seeing nothing else to come before us, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090203specialcalled?start=6186)|
