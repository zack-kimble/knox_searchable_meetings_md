| 0:00:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=27)|

| 0:00:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| HC Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=35)|
| 0:00:36| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| Fiona McAnally, 7459 Faker Ferry Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=37)|
| 0:00:49| We have our application for the annual Sundown in the City event taking place April 9th through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| Officer Huskin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| I have one manager listed that has an open beer conviction in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=58)|
| 0:01:09| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Councilman Pilo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| That's a mistake at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| I'll wait until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Well, I'll go ahead and move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Based on, I suppose, taking care of the problem which Officer Huskin has commented on, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=78)|
| 0:01:39| feel it would be good to look at that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=99)|
| 0:01:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| That was something I wasn't aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| How do we handle that, Mr. Swanson, or can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| You could allow her to orally amend, move to ask you all to make a motion to amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| application to remove that particular manager from consideration, if you wish to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| So, what the code says with regard to violations is that no permittee shall be a person who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=127)|
| 0:02:19| has been convicted of any violation of any ordinance related to the possession, sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| manufacture, or transportation of beer or convicted of any violation of laws against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic beverages or beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| So, you first have to decide whether this is a violation that falls within those parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| and frankly, I think that's open to interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| Unless Officer Huskin has some information that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Well, then I'll just let my motion stand and let you do as you, as your discretion suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Mr. Swanson, can you read that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| No permittee shall be a person who has been convicted of any violation of any ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| related to the possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of beer or convicted of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| any violation of the laws against possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| beverages or beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Is that the language you wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| That's the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| And, Officer Huskin, can you tell us what this, in simple terms, what this violation is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| In simple terms, it's having an open container of beer on a public lot or something, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| you've got a ticket for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| We're happy to remember that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| We have, I think, eight people listed on the permit, so we just wanted to make sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| always have someone at the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| What are the shows you all have coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Not sure yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| In fact, we're rushing to confirm all of them in the next week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| So, we'll be announcing it in about a week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Council Member Helquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| So, you're agreeing to remove that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| That's on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Well, can we get a motion from some member of the Board asking, moving to amend it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| delete that person as a manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| I would be glad to amend my motion, and if you want to second the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| I'll second your amendment to your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| I take it that's Mr. Shoemaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| I guess that means it's not just sort of a matter of taking him off here, but he actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| can't be a manager, and I'm not sure we want to say that because, I mean, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| if an abundance of caution is justified in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| I'm not sure that having an open beer in your hand on a public sidewalk keeps you from being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| a manager over beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| So, I mean, if you're willing for him not actually to be a manager, then that's an easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| solution, but I don't want to fall into something where you're going to say wink, wink, nod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| nod, he's not associated, and then do what he's doing anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| No, he's probably the most junior person on here, and I wasn't aware of that, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| happy to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| And Council Member Becker, I amended my motion based on the understanding that it was her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| intention that he not be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Well, I'm happy then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| That being her decision and not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| Yes, we're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| I just wanted to make a comment before she sits down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| I really wanted to congratulate you if you will pass that along to Mr. Capps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| It's an incredible news story which I brought to Council I believe last time in the New| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| York Times, which just gave extraordinary publicity to Knoxville and to what Mr. Capps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| is doing here with AC Entertainment, and I just wanted to be sure that he was aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| we are aware of how he's putting us on the map in a very positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| We're proud to be in Knoxville, and most of us Knoxvillians, so we're glad the New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| Times took notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| We need to vote on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=380)|

| 0:07:24| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Trevor Hill, 1105 Forest Avenue, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| on approval from the Fire Inspector, Building Inspector, Health Department and a copy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| the alcoholic beverage license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Councilman Hulkwist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Move to approve pending receipt of final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Do you have an ABC license at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| We're going to have to get what we call it, what they call a temporary CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| There was a mistake in the permits where a wall was not properly permitted and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| in the process of getting the road abandoned and acquiring some property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| The title attorneys are working on it now, but the fire marshal's been out, the plumbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| the electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| We should have our temporary CO end of next week and that's going to give us basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| a certificate of occupancy without actually getting a few of the final I's dotted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| T's crossed, but it will be good enough for the ABC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| After you get this temporary CO, how long will it be before they come and do their inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| They'll come do it the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Yeah, I mean, this is the third time maybe this has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| You have an idea, I mean, do you have a date certain, I mean, we've gotten dates certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Well, we had the worst weather that we've had in a while, so we've got it under control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| All the inspectors have been out, like I said, everything's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| We've done everything that we said we're going to do, just not quite as quick as we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| to obviously, but that's just kind of the way it's happened, unfortunately, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| shooting to have a temporary CO at the end of this coming week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| That's what we're going for, and you know, that puts us 30 days from the next beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Obviously, you're not going to give us a beer permit without having a liquor license, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| if you could issue it pending the ABC board giving us the liquor license, I think I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| done everything with the police department and done everything in my power to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| happen as quickly as possible, and you know, I'm not going to do anything that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| to get me in trouble or jeopardize my future in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| I want to make money, pay my taxes, and you know, do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| Well, I, for one, understand what you're saying, but in my mind, if you weren't getting an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=589)|
| 0:09:58| ABC license, then you're not eligible for a beer permit, so the only reason that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| would consider giving you a beer permit is the fact that you are, at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| going to be getting an ABC permit, so I, myself, will definitely have to vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| this if it comes to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| Can we not do the beer permit pending the ABC license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| If I don't get the ABC license, I don't get the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| I'm going to get an ABC license for the simple reason you don't see chain restaurants in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| dry counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| When they get liquor by the drink, they come for the simple reason that it's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| Unfortunately, that's what drives them, and I'm going to get the ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| Like you said, I can't have the beer permit without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| I mean, it would really, really be beneficial to me not to have to come back, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| y'all are sick of seeing me, to get it pending the liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Well, I tend to actually agree with you, Chairman Hall, on how I'd go in this particular motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| I guess to ask the specific question, I guess, you won't give the beer permit until you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=666)|
| 0:11:17| the ABC license, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| We will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Whichever way you'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| We've done something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| We've done a lot of thinking about there's some things that we're willing to say we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| going to give a permit pending final documentation, and some things that we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=692)|
| 0:11:41| We've made a decision that the police, the records check, we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| We're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I kind of feel the same way about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| I mean, this is something that the city of Knoxville would not give you a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| and the state's going to trump us, and I don't feel comfortable saying, well, we'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| wait and the day they trump us, we'll give in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| It almost feels like, before I make that vote, I want to know that they've trumped our laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| So, that's kind of what I'm feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| I've passed everything with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| My background check came back, done everything, took the classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| When I have the ABC license in my hand, I will go see Ms. Day, hand her a copy of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| to put in the file, and hopefully get my beer permit in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| I have every confidence you will do exactly what you said you'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| I think that the question that's before us right now is, if the council is acting appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=755)|
| 0:12:44| if we issue the permit before you have the license, because that is the only basis on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=764)|
| 0:12:52| which you get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| And I don't think that we are, I just want you to understand that we would not question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| you in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| And personally, I would rather have a special beer board meeting to accommodate you, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| my personal feeling, than for us to do something which, I guess my fear is that someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=786)|
| 0:13:15| will come along and ask the same favor, and someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| And pretty soon we have set a precedent, which really goes against our principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| And I think we're struggling to develop a set of strong principles here, because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| is a very important matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| So I'm afraid I have to agree with Chairman Hall and Councilman Becker, who's spoken up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| because, and I've favored your establishment all along, I have a great deal of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| in you, but you understand that this isn't about you, this is about us, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| in my public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Well, you know, like they said, the beer permit's not valid until the ABC permit is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| So you're really, I personally don't feel that you're actually issuing the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| you're issuing it pending the liquor license, which I have to produce to Ms. Day, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| know, she's a state employee, or a Knoxville employee, and she's going to do the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| And you know, I'm going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| I have all the confidence in her too, now I'm just looking at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Mr. Swanson, I think one of us asked this question to you a couple beer boards ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| and I think you said it was about 50-50, it was just to our discretion, but do you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| is there a precedence on this, do you have an opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| I do not have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| I do know that it has been done both ways in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| So in the most recent past, I would say that more often than not, you have deferred issuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| the beer permit until this body actually saw the liquor by the drink permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| Previous to that, it was more often that it was adopted subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| So it's within your discretion as a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Do you recall if we brought this up during the workshop we had, because I know we sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| of clearly defined we wanted to be consistent as a body, do you recall if we brought this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| up or if there was a, you know, I'd love to have a memory that good, but I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=917)|
| 0:15:25| I respect the opinion of several of my colleagues who have stated they would rather see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| permit themselves, but to me, until our office sees the ABC license, he will not get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=931)|
| 0:15:40| So I'm perfectly comfortable in trusting that that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| So I'll support Mr. Hill, but I respect others' views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| In the last seven years, to the best of my recollection, we've never approved one subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| to getting a beer permit, a liquor permit, since I've been chairman of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| It may have happened before, but I can't recall that that's happened since I've been chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| I have not had that many occasions to, but the ones that I'm familiar with happened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| be in my district, so I recall that we waited until that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| Councilman Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| I believe what we're discussing here tonight is not denial of this permit, but simply a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| second postponement pending receipt of the ABC certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Ms. Mitchell, was I the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| I seconded, but there were a couple of voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| If I was, I'd like to withdraw my second on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| I'll withdraw my motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| Councilman Frost, I'll move to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| So that would be the last Tuesday of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| Is there any way that we can get on before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Well, it would be four weeks from tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Mr. Swanson's pulling out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| The 24th, 25th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| So that's a month from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| We have had one special beer board meeting on this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Well, actually, you had it already planned and you just put me on as the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| It was when I was under the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I'd be willing to have another special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Of course, I won't be here that night, so it's easy for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| I mean, I personally don't have any problem calling a meeting five, ten minutes before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| We've done that on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| I just wanted to ask Mr. Hill, you say you have a date certain now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| We should have the temporary certificate of occupancy by the end of this coming week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| And that's what we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| As I said, the fire marshal, the plumbing, the electrical, the building, everybody's been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| We've got all the engineer's letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| They're installing the kitchen equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Well, why don't you let us know when you're ready to go and you get the ABC license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| and then I guess we can poll the council through the city recorder's office and have a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| How about if I have a temporary CO at the end of this following week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| I'll just go see Ms. Day and call Joe and we'll see if we can't make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| How does that sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| Councilman Pelo, do you have more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| So the motion is to postpone to the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Mr. Chairman, he mentions a temporary CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| I believe that's a certificate of occupancy which would be issued by city building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| and that's not the state ABC permit, so I don't think that that would be criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| It would have to be the ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| What he really should do is call me or Ms. Mitchell or Ms. Day whenever he gets his ABC permit in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1120)|
| 0:18:49| The state will come the same day that they give the temporary CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| That's as soon as the certificate of occupancy is issued, the state comes and gives you the liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| and, you know, the liquor vendors will basically be standing at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| I think the key, though, whether you have the CO or not, is if you have the permit from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| the liquor license from the state, then you can present it to the appropriate parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| But Mr. Frost's motion is to postpone until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| so I don't think we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| I think the motion would have to be modified in order for us to hear it in an earlier meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| since the action of this board would be to schedule it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| Mr. Frost, would your motion also include unless something like unless they produce it ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| we could hold a special meeting, or how would you word that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| Suggestions, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| How about a motion to postpone until the 24th subject to his receipt of the liquor by the drink permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| and his furnishing that liquor by the drink permit to either the beer board chairman, Ms. Day or Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Does that include, then, the possibility of a special beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| I didn't hear that in your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| That's not the way I understood it, but if that's what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| It's without being stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| But the record reflects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| If he gets that before March 10, which is when your next meeting is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| then he can furnish that document to one of those three people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| and then one of those three people can take charge of scheduling the special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| five minutes in advance of the March 10 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| So we're voting on an amendment to postpone a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1233)|
| 0:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1243)|

| 0:21:26| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| I was trying to remember how many times this place has changed hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| It's not really pertinent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I know since I've been on council over seven years, it's changed hands two, three times, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| You don't know the history?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| I know you've been before us on multiple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| It's been there since 1965, so I'm not surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| It's not really pertinent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| This is a rather historic establishment in the length of time it's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| But it has enjoyed new management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| Multiple ownerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Well, ownership and management both, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1320)|

| 0:24:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| We are doing monthly classes with the TAPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| The server and bartenders know that they will be terminated immediately if they are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| in compliance with following the legalities of drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| We have daily lineups where we explain the age limit, talk about how many drinks they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| allowed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| We go through all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| I'm a new director in the area for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| It's the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| I've been with the company 15 years and I've never had to do anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| I'm pretty good about following laws and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| The previous manager, Jerry's brand new there also, he's in the same general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| So we've changed all types of behaviors that that location had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| I do know the Chapman 2 location, we just got a letter saying, and that's one of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| restaurants also, that we passed with the beer sting that went through and they sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| us a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| We did a class with this location, the Strawberry Plains location, where they had to go in for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| a three-hour class on alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| So I'm begging for your forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| I mean, I can assure you we're doing everything in our power so they don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| There are repercussions for them doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| I mean, they're terminated immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Councilman Farrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| I was looking over the information you provided and both of these offenses were about six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| months apart in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| But the remedial plan that you all are doing, it's dated July 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| So if this is what was in place in July 2007, I can make a fair argument that it's not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| if we're still having two relatively close in time violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| I really don't know about the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| I'm not going to have an excuse for this letter that came from the support center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| But I do know what I'm responsible for with these classes that they are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| It's not the handwritten letter that I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| It's the responsible alcohol service paperwork, five pages that's printed referencing your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| company and it's dated very clearly July 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| I don't have anything that, I don't, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Cindy Solomon is the one that wrote this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| She's at the support center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| I'll pass you my copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Well, the first remedial plan, the second one that they received is attached to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| What about the, I didn't get that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| It's February 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Here's the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| The handwritten thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Everybody, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| There is a February 13th, 2009 letter here, which has a remedial cell to underage persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1606)|
| 0:26:59| and, you know, has a body here with some content in it pertaining to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| I think the remedial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| That's what Ross is looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| I think the remedial plan Rob was referring to was the first one they turned into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| The second one was attached in your beer board packet to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| It's dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| The one I was looking at came in my agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| And it related to the first event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Well, I was going to ask, have you seen your February 13th letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Because that spells out a number of things that you're going to do to prevent this from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| You didn't really mention any of it, and so, absent them seeing the letter, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Number one, new hire employees attend a top-shelf responsible beverage service training class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| to obtain the Tennessee server's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Number two, we're implementing training classes on the importance of accurate carding and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| observing signs of alcohol impairment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| All current servers, bartenders, and managers attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| The first training class was held in November 8th, 2008, 8 a.m., at the Ruby Tuesdays on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| Breakville Road, the Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| The class was taught by Pouncey Partners, a top-shelf responsible beverage service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| Number three, we're continuing education effort to the employees at 2714 Chapman Highway to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| send employees on an as-need basis to monthly carding class, currently being taught by Pouncey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| In addition, Ruby Tuesdays will seek additional training by BARS Program, a top-shelf responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| beverage service company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| This company will follow up on our employee performance of accurately carding a guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| The company will not use anyone under the legal age for alcohol service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| The carding stings will be performed unannounced and randomly at various Ruby Tuesday restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Alcohol awareness will be a topic at our daily staff lineup meetings, and alcohol awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| will be a topic at the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| It's twice, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| So the daily lineups is when they come in and clock in, we do a lineup with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| We do two of them a day, a.m. shift and p.m. shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| That's what that entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Council Member Woodhall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| What is top-shelf responsible beverage service company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| They're in Knoxville, and they come in every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| They go to each location in the Knoxville market, and they charge X amount of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| They go through questions with the servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| They do a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| To be employed, you have to have a card before we can even hire you, and we aren't letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| anyone serve under the age 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| We're hiring 21-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| We don't even allow anyone under 21 to be behind the bar now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| So they go through all those with our servers at our lineups, and then every month they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| update our books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| They send in unannounced visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Council Member Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Actually, I was pleased to see on your violations that in both instances the cadet was carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| So obviously something went well, and I'm tending to think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I like some of your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| I like a lot of what actually is in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| I guess I've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Well, comment and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| One is just there's some new thinking that I guess the Metropolitan Drug Commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1813)|
| 0:30:32| sort of pushing now against this idea of automatically firing anybody who gets caught selling, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| gets caught in a sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| It's an interesting thought that these are people that actually are learning something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| that they've done it wrong, and firing them might be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| You might lose somebody who actually knows how to do it wrong, and that helps you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| it right all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| That's worth thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| The question I have is the two times that you sold, what went wrong with the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| and how is what you're going to do now going to correct this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Was this just a matter of somebody was in a hurry and didn't look at it, so reminding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| them will help, or was there a more systemic failing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| What went wrong these two times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| It's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Like I said, I was not over that location, so I do not know, is what I was told by previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| leadership that had been around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| They didn't cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| That's what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Then on one occasion, I was told they didn't see the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| The date was miscued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| So, I'm unsure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Clearly, the violations we have said, they were carted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| They were carted on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Do you have any sense of what happened with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Was this a misread the date, or was it something else, just a sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| I wasn't the plainclothes officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| I just come in after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| I'm not sure, but they were carted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| It's always helpful, again, if your folks did half of what you're supposed to do right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| it's always good to know what's the half we missed for the next training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| We are telling dates now, if that matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| We are telling the dates at our lineup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Like if you were born in 1970, can you drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| If you were born in 1990, can you drink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| You know, going that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Is the lighting good in the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| I mean, that's the other thing we have sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| It's dim lighting, and you're trying to read small print in dim lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| At this location, yeah, it's lit good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Yeah, it's lit pretty good, but I learned when I went to the task class a couple weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| ago that having the patron pull their ID out of their pocketbook or their wallet makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| it easier to detect a fake, or it gives you a little more leniency, and you can pull it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| to where you can actually see the date under the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| So, I can make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| I just had a question regarding the, was it Top Shelf organization that you're using for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| training and to assist you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| When did you begin to employ them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Palliative Partners is our main employer that comes in every month that we pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| When did you begin to use their services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Would it have been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| 2000 probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Full effect, all Ruby Tuesdays, I would say four years ago, three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| So, you were using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| But we weren't using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| They just come in once a month and do our books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| You were not using their training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Well, I just noticed that this one offense occurred on 11-13 of 08, and unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2002)|
| 0:33:31| you had had your class on 11, wasn't it, 8 of 08, November the 8th of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Charles Oasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| The wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Am I looking at the wrong one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| I flipped the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I'm looking at the other establishment, and I thought, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| Usually...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| You made me nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Well, it makes me embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| So we made both be even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| No, I just had looked at that, and I thought, usually these are in order of the way that we hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| But this, tonight, they're reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| So, no comment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Frankly, I was rather impressed with your efforts here and hoping that they work for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| I read your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| I was pleased to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| I'm glad that you learned something at the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| It was a great...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Experience, because that is a wonderful training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| We'll implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Counselor Muthall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Officer Huskey, you're aware of Top Shelf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| Feel good about their product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| I have looked over their product, and it is pretty intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| Any further discussions, questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| Paul's Oasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| Paul Osterberg for Paul's Oasis, 8021 Kingston Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| You're here tonight because you've had two violations of sales to underage people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| and to present us with a plan of how you intend on preventing that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| We had it in an 18-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| We did have two sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| I presented the plan to the city recorder of what we're going to do in addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| I mean, I know Councilman mentioned about terminating an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| but it has been our policy if someone does violate the law in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| they do lose their job and they are held responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| I've been further instructing everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| I've posted a memo out to everybody, and I've been on a weekly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| and even daily being more visual as to what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| In this particular case, the bartender did card the cadet and must have misread the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2159)|
| 0:36:07| because she told me she said he was of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| I said, well, obviously he wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| And I also provided her prior to that incident with a pen light for the lighting issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| And I said, well, did you use your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| She says, well, the battery died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| So she didn't use it at the time, which I was unaware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| So I'm instructing them further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Anybody at that time, our policy was if they look like they're in their 20s and 30s, card them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| Now it's everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| If you don't know, if you haven't carded them before, you make sure that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| And I'm visually checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| And if there's any question as to the validity of the ID, they are not to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| Bring it to me to see whether or not if I should accept that ID or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| And like I said, on a weekly basis and even daily, depending on who the server is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| we're going over carding, and they are carding everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| As a matter of fact, tonight I had a regular come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| He's about 45, bartender, never saw him before, and asked him for his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| And he just kind of looked at me and said, do I have to present it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| It's a bartender's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| And I was happy to see that, that they are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| So we are being more stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| But in this particular case, she dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| She did ID him as she was supposed to ID him and misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| Councilman Grodek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| Mr. Is it Osterbrink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Yes, Osterbrink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Osterbrink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| I understand from your documents that you are a smoking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| And no one should even be on your premises who's under the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| That is correct also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| And how do you manage that in terms of folks entering from the front door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| We ask them to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| When they come in and they're carded, and if they are not 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| we ask them to leave immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| So they're carded at the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| No, I don't have a doorman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| When they come into the bar, and if they come in and sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| and the server or bartender goes up to them, he or she will ask them for their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| If they are not 21, they're asked to leave immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| But if someone comes into your restaurant and orders a Coke, they're never carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| If they order a Coke, they're still carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| If we don't know you, we card you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Because we are a smoking facility, you have to be 21 to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| And if you are just ordering a Coke, you still get carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| And we've had some heated discussions with patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| They said, well, I'm just getting a Coke, I'm their designated driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I said, but you're not 21, you cannot be here, and you have to leave, and they do leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Have you considered hiring a doorman so that you're screening those folks at the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| and then you've kind of got a double fail-safe system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| Given the way we're set up and established, putting a full-time doorman on would be kind of difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| because of the way our business is and just the way we're set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| And, you know, trying to get into that front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| And, frankly, it's the expense of it to make sure, you know, even though, like in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2349)|
| 0:39:17| this particular case, the person was carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| And we do card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| If we do not know you, if we have not carded you before, you're carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| And if you are not 21, you are asked to leave immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| I guess one of the things that concerns me about your plan is it seems to be so owner-centric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| I mean, so much of the policy centers around your observation of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| and your enforcement of what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| And that's a difficult job for one person to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| I don't see any continuing education in your plan, which I think we've found with a lot of businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| hopefully is a help in terms of getting their employees back through training, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| whether it's a once a week rereading the policy or bringing in a trainer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| or sending them to task once a year or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| I wish there were a continuing education piece in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Well, actually, like I said, there is through me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| I discuss it with everybody on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| I go over the ID and making sure they're doing it, review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| making sure that they're checking on certain things of IDs, that they're valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| And I do observe, and actually I have some customers that will also let me know if someone didn't do an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2430)|
| 0:40:39| But fortunately, we're a small family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| We have only seven servers, bartenders and servers is all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| And it's very close knit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| And that's kind of why it's more central through me just because we're not a large organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| We're a very small organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| And I do review with them on a weekly basis about carding, making sure they're doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| and that they're carding everybody that they do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| And even though I may know them, and if they don't, they do card them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| And like I said, like tonight was a prime example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| They looked at me, do I need my ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| I said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| And he had to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| He left it in his car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| He had to go out to his car and bring it in before we would do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Now, I understand as a small business there are unique challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| There's just a whole lot of pressure on you with this remediation plan to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Yeah, actually I think Ms. Rowdy raises some interesting points about training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| It's worth, I don't know, Ms. Rowdy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| of calling the drug commission just as sort of a way to think about what are some other cost-effective ways to get help with training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| That might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| The question I had for you is you clearly sort of heard my question for Ruby Tuesdays about what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2512)|
| 0:42:00| and how are you going to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| You had the person, did you use the pen light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| No, it's out of battery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| So do you have a big stock of batteries in there now for the pen lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Actually, I've issued out some more pen lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I just went out and bought them at the store and issued them to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| And assist them for making sure that they're out there working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| I'm checking with them when they come in and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Councilman Pilon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Well, in reading your plan, Mr. Osterbrink, I observed some of the very same points that Ms. Rowdy has already spoken to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2543)|
| 0:42:31| so I won't repeat those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| But I will say that I have a number of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Let's just think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Your establishment is open right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| You're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| So much centers around you and the instruction that you give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| And there appears to be no one else to whom anyone can turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| That concerns me greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| There's another observation I have because your establishment is in the district that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| live very close to it, have been in your establishment with previous owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| It is absolutely next door to Tories R Us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Well, I'm really familiar with a lot of the activity over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| and probably it's just been my sense that it's kind of a, I guess I'd call it a kind of a clannish place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2604)|
| 0:43:35| kind of a hangout that a lot of people who have enjoyed coming there for years still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| And I keep hearing you say, well, we card if we don't know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| You know, that's a lot of judgment that you have to put on yourself and on your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| So I'm particularly concerned about this kind of judgment aspect of your plan instead of carding everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| Well, I'm not so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| I mean, we have a regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| We're a small neighborhood bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I mean, that's what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| We have regulars that come in here every day, you know, afternoons and at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| And if they're a regular, we've carded you, and we know we've seen you in here many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| We know you're of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| If there's somebody that, like I said, a gentleman came in tonight, I knew him as a regular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| but the bartender has never served him before, and he carded him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| I'm not going to debate that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| It's my observation that this is not a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| If it's just based on knowing you, remembering you, thinking my judgment is going to be good enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| expecting your employee's judgment to be good enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| I think that was one reason that some of the new regulations were passed by this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| and that have been passed by other beer boards in the area, which say it is a good plan to card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2691)|
| 0:45:00| And then the employee is not put in a position of making a judgment or a recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| I'm just simply saying when I read your plan and knowing of some of the other situations that have stemmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2705)|
| 0:45:15| from that establishment, I'm not really comfortable at all with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| I'm not sure what you're referring to about other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| I mean, when I first took it over, that was a little over four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| there was a clientele that came there that was very questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| And we've cleaned that up tremendously to the point which it's now laid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| It's not the rowdy crowd that used to be there years ago when prior ownership had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| And we've done that through discipline, through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| I just agree with Ms. Roddy that really an educational plan is a critical need for your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| Taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Any other questions, comments, concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| I get a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090224?start=2773)|
