| 0:00:30| Like for us, it's been a while, I think most people know each other, but if we could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=30)|
| 0:00:37| around and just do introductions, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=37)|

| 0:01:42| So our first order of business today is we do have to approve the minutes from September 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=102)|
| 0:01:49| Have you all had a chance to take a look at those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| Does anyone feel comfortable making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| All right, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| We want to just start and spend some time talking just generally about ordinance amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| and the process the city undertakes to update the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| And we're also going to recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| I know we talked a little bit in September about this, but we'll recap a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| what's been completed to date and how many additional ordinance amendment requests are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| currently in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| I'm going to turn it over to Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Thanks so much, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| It's great to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| It's really great to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| I think some of you I have literally have not seen in person since the, you know, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| like a year and a half now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| So it's very, very nice to see people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| So you all know that when the new ordinance was adopted, we were all very uncertain about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| what the process was going to look like for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| And we knew that with a new ordinance, we were going to run into issues, you know, glitches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| things that were just not crafted exactly the way they needed to be to be practically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| So we knew that from the very beginning and knew that this committee, you know, we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| to make sure that we had a committee that would have its eye on that process to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| sure that we were identifying deficiencies in the code and making recommendations for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| So, you know, after the last meeting, we really took a step back and said, okay, let's keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| that goal in mind and make sure that we do have processes in place that are working appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| to make sure that we have the feedback mechanisms in place and that there are ways to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| How has that worked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Have there been amendments based on that feedback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Where is that feedback coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| And how many amendments have taken place and been completed and how many are in the pipeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=230)|
| 0:03:57| And there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| There's a lot that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Many of you have already been involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| So it's been a really busy time despite the fact that we've been going through a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| and we might not all be seeing each other in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| There's been a lot of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Amy's going to talk about that in just a minute in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| But I just wanted to do a quick overview of the ordinance amendment process and kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| how what we've observed the way that it actually is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| So the process is really initiated by planning or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| And we get feedback from a variety of mechanisms to initiate that ordinance amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| We have stakeholders, external stakeholders that contact staff, that contact planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| commissioners, that contact city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| I've received some of those calls from external stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| And those are, I mean, a variety of external stakeholders, community organizations, developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| who are saying, listen, we've observed this and we think something needs to be done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| address an issue or a deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| So those come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Staff sometimes identify and, you know, I think Peter and Amy can both speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| But just in working through projects, you start to notice, oh, there's a deficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| or there's an aspect of the code that isn't quite meeting the needs of our community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| we need to do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| So staff will identify deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| And then direct calls to planning commissioners who are making recommendations on ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| amendments or city council members who are adopting those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| Those either direct phone calls or, you know, for those who are nerds like I've always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| when you sit through enough meetings, you start to see, oh, they're seeing that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| an issue that hasn't been identified through another means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| And so right in the middle of a meeting they'll say, listen, planning, you know, we may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| to take a look at this because we're seeing a repeated issue here that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| So can you please take a look at this aspect of the ordinance and bring us a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| So all of those things, I would say, have happened over the past couple of years where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| there's this input process that's coming from a variety of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| And then we take that and do some research and exploration internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| And literally either it's been on Zoom a lot, but we'll, between the city and planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| our staff will sit around a table and say, okay, let's do some research and figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| if this is indeed something that needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Is it an interpretation issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| How big of an amendment or how important is this to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| So it's a collaborative internal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| And then we'll reach out to external stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| And several of you have been part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| We've called on you and appreciate it when we call and we say, hey, can you spend a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| bit of time with us understanding from an external perspective how this particular aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| of the ordinance is affecting your work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| It's affecting your constituency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Oftentimes there's disagreement between stakeholder groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| That's all part of public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| And so we're gathering that and starting to do some research on what kind of recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| would be needed and how big of a priority it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| I think you all are aware that, you know, there's a lot more work sometimes than there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| So sometimes we just have to prioritize, is this something that needs to happen now or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| can it happen later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| We've held workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| So, for example, over the past, since the ordinance has been adopted, there's been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| workshop on changes to the plan development process, changes to the signed standards in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| the institutional zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| And so on occasion, and we know that there are some amendments, potential amendments coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| up that we'll have to have workshops on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| And so that's part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| And then it goes to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Once we have an ordinance that we're all, you know, we've reviewed, we feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| with the language, city, planning, everybody's, you know, our stakeholders have looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| it, then it goes to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| That's a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| It's posted publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Comments are, there's a comment section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| And in that public meeting, planning commission will review, make the recommendation to city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| council, which then, as you know, has to have two readings of any ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| So it's a pretty lengthy process, but we feel it works really well because it provides a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| lot of opportunity for stakeholder input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| And we have certainly seen a pretty good volume of recommended ordinance amendments coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| So I'm going to turn it over to Amy, because in talking about that big process, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| sound like how in the world did we ever get anything done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| But the reality is there's been a lot of feedback on the ordinance already and amendments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| have already successfully gone through the entire process over the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| You all have in your, and we distributed this during the last meeting, but we went ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and made an additional copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| It's a spreadsheet that has some green fields on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| This is what we reviewed at the last one, but I think it's important to point it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| that we have completed 21 ordinance amendments to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| And so a lot of these, the ones that are highlighted in green are ones that specifically were discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| at this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| But as you can see, there's a lot more that were taken into consideration and moved forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| We have received 14 suggestions from several members of this body as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| So I really appreciate you all submitting those or reaching out to those entities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| And those have been included in the spreadsheet that's attached to your packet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| We can discuss those here in a couple minutes if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Of those 14, we have one that is currently in the process and another one that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| on that list that is currently going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| It just was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| They both were approved by Planning Commission this month and are moving on to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| And there are several that are currently in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| As Stephanie mentioned, we get requests quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| So we maintain a list, an active list of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| So there's two or three that are not currently listed on either one of the spreadsheets that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| And I'm happy to discuss what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Again, it comes down to what is the priority of them and the timing to be able to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Does anyone want to talk about any of these specifically or have any questions about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| process that Stephanie has laid out describing how these are taken through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=658)|
| 0:11:07| Amy, in your opinion, I guess in Stephanie's too, how long do you see this body continuing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=667)|
| 0:11:15| Do you see it at some point sunsetting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Because it looks like out of the 24 or so that you showed on here, like four came to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| So certainly a vast majority are going through the Planning Commission like the normal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| has always been and then the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| So I mean, long range, how long do you think this committee should stay in existence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| Well, Pat, you just cut right to the chase, don't you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| I tried to, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| So I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| You already got us to next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| And we do want to have some conversation about, A, the process, ways that we can improve that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| feedback because we want to make sure to get adequate feedback from a variety of diverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| And we also want to make sure that we actually can get things done in the meantime and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| these things through the process they have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| So right now, Pat, the resolution that formed this committee calls for the committee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| sunset like at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| So it is December of 2021 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| So what we're going to talk about is this really is the last meeting of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| and how do we continue to utilize the expertise around the table in a way that is productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| for you and for the city and for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| So that's going to be part of the next steps discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| I see a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| I have a question in regards to our ability to submit an ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=772)|
| 0:13:01| Is that something that we can bring up via in-person meeting or email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| What is the process if we see an ordinance in the zoning code that I feel or we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| is something that needs to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| That is really as simple as a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| So that's a lot of times that's how the ball gets rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| It's, you know, a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Peter's gotten calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| I'm sure, Peter, we need to do something about this section of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| Amy has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| I'm sure planning commissioners have received phone calls about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| City council members have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| So it's coming from a variety of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| But a phone call or a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Hey, can we just sit down and take a look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| And then that gets it on our radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| So I have a I have an ordinance concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| Should I do that out of this meeting or in the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| What is your email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Is it on the list already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| OK, well, your preference, Brian, I think if if this is, you know, I don't want to I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| don't want to start a big debate in the meeting, but it's in regards to the short term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| ordinance that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Oh, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| And I know it's part of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| No, that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Not the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| OK, so I'll just go through the channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Let's feel free to reach out, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| That's the other thing I do want to mention is that there is, you know, sometimes confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| over what's part of the land use zoning code and the other code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| That's in the business license section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| I can give you a section number later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=890)|
| 0:15:00| Dr. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| I just have a question about form based codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| If we decided that we were going to have another form based code area, what is the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| for deciding that and how is there public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Because I just felt like the Cumberland that there was not really adequate public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| or we didn't have a good understanding exactly what was going on with Cumberland as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| sidewalk width and frontages and things that really would enhance pedestrian activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| And of course, you know, there's no really any bicycle facility along Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| And also even the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And I just wondered how is that going to be processed for doing a form based code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| Where is that initiated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Who's participating in that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| So talking about our existing code or the potential of adding new form based codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| I'm still for adding an area of form based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I don't know that any is in mind, but I would just like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| Because that's a very, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| I'm just looking at it from the perspective of mingling the public space with the private space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| And that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| I think it's similar to what Stephanie laid out for Brian in that I think a good place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| to start is to contact us, contact planning, and we would convene a meeting and talk, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| bring in Peter and his team and have a discussion about what area you're particularly interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| And so that would apply to also amendments to the current form based code as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| So I think it could be approached in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| And there need to be further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| So to establish a new zone goes pretty well beyond just amending what we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| I guess I was wondering more that if the city sees an area where they're considering a form based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| how would that be publicized or how could the public be involved with that in a more direct way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| I'll take that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| And first maybe start off by saying we don't have any form based code visions that we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1038)|
| 0:17:28| If that were to happen, I think we would, I would immediately pick up the phone and call Amy, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| hey, we need to sit down and talk about is this a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| I mean, our planning organization is the expert on whether we need a form based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| What would the public process look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| So we don't have any on the horizon right now, but it would have to be a really robust public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| I think the question Amy had asked is of the items that are in front of you that either have the ordinance amendments that have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1078)|
| 0:18:10| or if you submitted ideas for ordinance amendments that you just really want to advocate for and make sure that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1090)|
| 0:18:19| try to move it up to the top of the list, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Amy, Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| I just was wondering, can you explain for us non-professionals what design standards in CG1 mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1104)|
| 0:18:36| So, you know, there are design standards associated with CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| and I believe the direction that we got from council was we want planning to explore adding similar design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| and really they're dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| So more of like the applying that what happens in CG2 and CG3 to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| So it's not a directive, but it's a hey, can you take a look at this, look at what the pros and cons are would be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| So fenestration, orientation of a door to a public street, those types of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Would it affect the parking in the front, parking in the side, parking in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Looking at all of those aspects of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Do you think that would be an issue that would be workshopped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Because we've spent a lot of time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| So there are a number of these on here that I think we would need to bring together key stakeholders to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Yeah, that would be one that would be a red flag, I think, for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| I'm not sure how to get the red light on, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| One consideration with the CG1, and we ran into this on the Bearden Village Council when I was president of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1195)|
| 0:20:07| and when the code was being developed, the new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| If you take an area like Kingston Pike through the Bearden Village area, you have a five-lane highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1212)|
| 0:20:27| that is actually the alternative in case of emergencies to I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1227)|
| 0:20:36| This is quite different from some other cases for CG1 where having buildings that are faced to the major highway might make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1236)|
| 0:20:49| But in this case, one of the things that we realized is what we really need to do is to focus instead on the adjoining streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1249)|
| 0:21:01| So as this develops, I think it will be important to consult with the neighborhood organizations and with organizations like Bearden Village Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1261)|
| 0:21:12| so that those differences that can occur across the city will be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1272)|
| 0:21:25| I think that's a really good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| I think one example of, I would consider it sort of a case study for successfully getting an ordinance amendment in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| was the sign standards in institutional zones where all of the stakeholders and the chamber helped with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1296)|
| 0:21:44| You were involved with that, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Yes, very involved, and we had Scenic Knoxville was involved, really getting everybody around the table where there were some pretty disparate views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1306)|
| 0:21:55| but we finally, through everybody's input and good facilitation, we got an ordinance to council that everyone supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1315)|
| 0:22:04| So I think when you're speaking about neighborhood constituents, and I think, Amy, you're thinking about your business constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| I think there's a way to get people together, maybe not to always agree, but to compromise and get to a place where people are comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| I think that's going to be really important with some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Oh, sorry, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Your light is blocked by your, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| I think for me it's just trying to understand, I know that the staff has done an amazing job of changing things and hearing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| but I think the entry cost to do that is high for the people that come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| meaning they are already engaged with professionals, a project, spending money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| probably at that point in a problem position because they've got a unique condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| and therefore it's exposed this potential request to change something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| And so I'm wondering, I understand this being our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| is it truly the wish of staff and the administration to keep it at that high bar for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1392)|
| 0:23:24| and not in a setting like this that allows a layperson to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1404)|
| 0:23:33| you know, people are smart enough to lay out a house lot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Put a box on the site and understand and they can read and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| well, I can't do this because of these problems, and we'll never probably hear those problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| because they aren't going to get to the professional level that gets to your phone call and your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1424)|
| 0:23:52| So I feel like the idea of this committee was such a good one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| because the process that led up to this was such a good one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| in that it allowed for that input at a low entry cost for the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| to bring things that we as professionals may or may not be seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| because we never got to see them because of the entry cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And so that for me a little bit was a great idea of this two-year 12-24 meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| however many meetings we were supposed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| And again, that was some of my comments at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| was that the spirit of that was such a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| And COVID got in the way and all this other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| So none of this is a slight about any work that the staff is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| They're doing a great job, but they're completely inundated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| And is it better, and I don't know, to hear some of these ideas in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1482)|
| 0:24:51| provide a regular moment for public input or questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| or even parsing out what is and isn't a zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Because a lot of people, again, I've said people call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| and I go, that's not even in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| And Dr. Cooley brought up the form-based stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| That wasn't part of our purview either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| And there's lots of issues with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| So I'm just for the way that it was such an open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| and outward discussion for many years, and a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| I can't say enough good things about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| To go back into an insular staff phone call method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| seems a little bit backwards to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| We've gone so far, and I feel like if we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| it doesn't have to involve everybody either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| It's a point of, hey, this came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| and it's a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And those that are interested can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Those that aren't interested don't have to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| There's no obligation to sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| But is there a way or a spirit of you as the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| and the administration to keep those open lines of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| that has a very low threshold of entry cost to have that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| to not be most laypeople aren't going to call you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| because they are unrepresented at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| And if they are represented at that moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| that means they're paying somebody something to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| and to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| And I felt that this board and this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| was at least carrying that discussion through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| It doesn't have to live for an infinite amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| But for me, it felt like such a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| for those questions to be deferred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| I feel like you as staff would love to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Just come to that meeting, and we'll listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| And maybe we'll work it out here as a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| that it never has to get that big meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| that takes all five of you and other people that aren't even here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| Get into that room, take your time to do on a bigger level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| It's almost like the clearinghouse for the building permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| We have these monthly meetings that you guys have put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| and they're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| This is a more philosophical question, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| And that's where my points were last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| when we talked afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| It's not about the work that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| You guys are doing amazing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| It's just so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| So many different ways that it comes into your door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| It's an email. It's a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| It's a project that's in problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| It's an MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| But this body allowed that kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| We don't have anybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| so apparently maybe there's no interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| So again, it may be something that a lot of folks have forgotten about for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| Those that sit on this board don't forget the hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| that you guys did and we did as a group for many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| to get this miraculous change to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| which has definitely helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| It's not perfect. We all agree it's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| It's a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| And I think this helps continue that discussion in an open manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| that I think can squelch maybe some of the noise you hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| And it again puts things on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| and it brings things to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| that again maybe we're all ignorant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| because that person's unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| So again, it starts to really keep this open dialogue going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| And that's where I felt that we didn't do our job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| because of the meetings, the lack of meetings before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| not the duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| The duration's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| You're not doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| There's no slight whatsoever about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| It's about the opportunity to come here with no entry costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| And I felt that that was some of the spirit of it, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| And I know you guys take phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| I know you answer and you know you guys put the meetings together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| It's for the person that's unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| And apparently maybe there aren't any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| And maybe the conversation, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| and this I think would be a good discussion to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| is how can we continue to be intentional about engaging those voices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Because I'm not even sure that folks would show up at a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| I think that's part of the challenge is how do you get that voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| and we keep that intention because this is not an unusual occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| So I think it's a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| and it's a worthy question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| And I think the rhythm and the cadence of it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| We don't have it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| And I don't think anybody here has gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| When I get those comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| I think it's clearly represented in the meeting notes that stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| I would say come to this meeting and please tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Like they might be grabbing me in the middle of me running down something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| and I'm like, well, hey, come to that meeting on the 24th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| and come tell us your grievances as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| And we'll hear it and we'll work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| If it has legs, then it starts to go up to those meetings that you guys have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| And so I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| The cadence has certainly created the lack of participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| But if it's there, again, I'm just spitballing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| and trying to think of a philosophical way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| so that folks don't think that it's that insular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| I have to get into a meeting room behind closed doors to affect change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| And positive change at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| because we're working on the last 5% or 7% of this beautiful document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| that will always get amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| And I think that's the spirit of what I thought we were doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Brian, I think Brian wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Yeah, and before we go into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| I guess I'd play devil's advocate with John on how does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| your scenario you laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| how does that differ from the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| where somebody wants to build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Simple case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Somebody wants to build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| It doesn't work in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| They go to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| They say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Well, then they go to the Board of Zoning Appeals like they always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| And I guess the way I've understood this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| is that we were here to facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| re-housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| because that means an updated zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| that's been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| And at that point, it's the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| not re-housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| but it's the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| And there's a problem that we have that's always been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| in the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| Why does the Board of Zoning Appeals pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| what we left off on after we facilitated this new document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| The Board of Zoning Appeals are dealing with case-by-case issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| And again, something that could affect many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| only then therefore affects one at someone's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| And so that is my reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| How can we affect a lot of people without one person...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Well, then I would argue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| if there needs to be a change to the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| and we are still in existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| the public individually shouldn't be coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| We're not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Staff should be coming back saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| we've found out a flaw, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| or a change needs to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| needs to be run through the committee, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| But I have no desire to be a sounding board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| We didn't sign up for a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| And regular public meetings at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| So I think in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| it's almost a be careful what you wish for sort of scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| I understand the slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| And we did sign up for 24 meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| with the two-year past ordinance adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| So we did sign up for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| and we're at the conclusion of that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| And therefore, the participation after today is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| something that you would look inwardly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| and say, do I want to do that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| And I agree, not everybody wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I think from the AIA's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| who I am here representing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| I'm not here representing John Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| here representing the AIA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| And it is, we know as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| we are at that variance board every bit as much as we were before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| if not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| And it's because we're trying to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| we're in corners of the cities we've never been in before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| And it's all these unique things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| that now we're applying this untested document to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| and we're still in that same kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| we're at the BZA all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| And I know things are getting fixed and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| And so it's, again, I think it's the spirit of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| and the outward appearance of listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| and the participation at the zoning level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| which doesn't really happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Commission is just not a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| to have someone come and speak to that group is a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| I don't think I'd do it, to be honest, for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Pat's about to take the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| he's about to come over here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| get out of the way because I'm going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| officiating this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| So we make sure, thank you, John and Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| Really appreciate these comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| We've got a couple of lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| and I think people want to respond to some of what they're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| I don't know whose light came on first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| but Mary, I saw you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| This is pretty short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I'm wondering whether the extent to which both economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| and planning interact with the office of neighborhood empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| and the members of that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I mean, we're all, we all work for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| No, but I'm thinking about the people who are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| or were part of the board or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| members of the office of neighborhood empowerment would be a way to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| to see what John is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Yeah, that's a good, that's a really good thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| And we have the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| the office of neighborhoods facilitates the neighborhood advisory council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| which is a really good representative group of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| constituents, but that's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Thank you, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| I appreciate your comments about this body can serve, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| another purpose in terms of getting the public's comments back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| appropriate officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| I think this was set up originally just to deal with recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| which is now our new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| And we knew that going in that there's going to be instances where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| going to miss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| And we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| And I think we've kind of ironed out a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| But traditionally, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| the planning commission is the body where these kinds of things come to on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| I've never been to a community where we had a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| a secondary board that also considered amendments and then sent those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| into the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| You know, normally you use your staff for those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| So if you really have an issue that is a concurrent repeatedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| and you see problems, email, call the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| and they can address most of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| And if they start seeing a trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| then they'll bring it to the planning commission that will vote up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| on it and then go to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| The other thing, and it's, it's not regarding really the meetings, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| you know, I'm going to speak up for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| they are shorthand and having more meetings to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| even as infrequent as these meet sometimes it still adds to their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| their schedule to get minutes out and get notices out to attend the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| with three people here now. And they are just understaffed. So any way that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| I see that we can reduce the number of meetings that they have to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| and they can deal with directly with the developers and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| themselves directly, then that helps them long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| Keep some sanity because I know they're, you know, when we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| we ask them to do amendments all the time and they'll, they'll say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| we got to have a work plan. We've got to follow our work plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| We can't really deviate from that. We'll add it next year. So we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| you know, we're dealing with stuff that may be a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| two years down the road before we actually get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And then moving on to city council. So that's my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2245)|
| 0:37:37| Just want to speak to an observation that we've had a staff in terms of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| some of these amendments come up. I know Stephanie did a great job of laying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| how we handle those and some of the more formal process, but a lot of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| so for example, the, the CG design standards and CG one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| and then item number, where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Six discussed potential overuse of CG two and CG three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| These were all observations that were made by an appointed or elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| official. After having a community member who didn't really know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| the lingo or the terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| we're just trying to work on a project or try to move something forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| said, Hey, these are some things that we need to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| And so I know these were submitted by a committee member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| but there are observations that happened in meetings themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And I know that Peter and Brian keep a list of issues that come up as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| of BZA that need to be tackled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| So we are looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| even if someone doesn't know the lingo or doesn't quite understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| might need to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| we're trying to be very deliberate and noting what those are and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Hey, these need to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| And designer view board is another excellent example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| So infill housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| we have a list of amendments that we would like to make associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| infill housing to make it easier for people to develop at those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| So, you know, we're doing all that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| I just want to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| there's just a number of different ways that those come up than just having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| to call one of us and say, Hey, there's an issue with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| And this is what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| We're trying to be more proactive now that we have this new code and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| our current staff to be able to identify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| Brian, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Or Pat, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Yeah, I would also say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| I had one of the things I think too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| we need to look at is how effective we've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| And so, for example, I mean, city council's the decider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| And so for institutional zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| I think we voted like three times not to change the sign thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| And Amy and I still spend tons of meetings because we had a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| member that disagreed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| And we still have to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| So I have concerns that even if we did continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| Mary and I agree on CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| we're still going to fight that battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| So I wish we had more influence with council that they would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| look, this diverse group agreed with us on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| So we're going to take their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| That ideally would have been the way it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| but that has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| That does get me to a question that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| And it really, it goes back to John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| what you were talking about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| How can we keep this group engaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And I have a couple of ideas that I wanted to share with the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| that you all are out there representing and interacting with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| community and you have an above average knowledge of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| ordinance and what's going on in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| So you're getting feedback just through your routine interaction on all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| of the variety of things that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| So we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| we don't want to lose that and want to stay in communication with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| So getting your feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| whether it's through submitting comments or through making the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| calls, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| regardless of what system we have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| we're still going to get the phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| We're still going to have people coming to us and asking for amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| even if we have a formal process and a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| So that doesn't go away just by the nature of having a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| So we want that dialogue to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| And then ultimately, Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| I was just tag teaming on what you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| participating in the process as these things go through planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| commission and city council, because ultimately this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| the decision is city council's decision and hearing from a variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| You all are, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| very aware that oftentimes when issues come to council and to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| you're only hearing from a few voices who have really strong opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| That's, there's nothing wrong with that. We want that to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| but sometimes a more reflective and holistic perspective can be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| for elected and appointed officials to have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| So those are some of my thoughts about staying informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| staying involved, that there are ways that we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| add you to email lists or distribution lists as information goes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| that, you know, those are things that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Wayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| I just wanted to say that I understand what John was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| I also understand what Amy was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| A good example of that is that we spent almost three and a half years on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| the time task force and the committee met every other month and we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| lot of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| And we came up with a recommendation and we went to city council and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| turned it down and they came up with their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Do you remember Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| And so I think there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| there's pros and cons in terms of how you go about getting information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| I do know that there are concerns that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| but ultimately city council, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| there does have homework done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| So I understand what John's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| And I sort of feel like I'm definitely a proponent of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| I also think we have to consider where that public input is coming from and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| And if a committee like us really has no power on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| then we just created another step along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| which I'm not sure that's, but I do think what Amy's saying is so true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| Ultimately it ends up in the hands of the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| And that's where you get an awful lot of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2626)|
| 0:43:58| John's got his light on just one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| The fact about the meetings, I'm so sensitive about that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| I think that's why I suggest a forum so that staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| themselves don't have to be almost bothered by every request because they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| they are so good and they almost have to vet these requests in private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| Again, taking someone's time and someone's efforts to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| And so again, it's, it's, it's almost like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| would you rather staff direct people to come to a meeting where it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| decrease your private meetings and add a public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| It seems like there, again, I know how many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| I reluctantly request meetings with you guys because I know how hard it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| to get everybody in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| And it also takes you away from the actual work that you need to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| which is probably reviewing plans and, and signing off on things and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| and making good policy moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| So meetings are a sensitive subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| I mean, we're all challenged with time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| And even from the professional's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| to get our teams together to come meet with you takes time and it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| someone money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| And again, we're, we're looking at it from a very, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| maybe too small of a layer to make these comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| But again, when we create those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| the dollars that are being spent on the staff level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| the professional side is monumental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| And all of that comes back to the end user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| So all of these things that we're talking about create an end user issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| that's going to drive up, that drives up housing costs, development costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| you know, the cost of a sandwich, it all comes back to the end user, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| And so all of those things cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| And so that's where I was thinking is that if some sounding board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| not to create a layer, we're not elected, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| but it does give you a scapegoat almost to avoid a meeting privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| to say, come to this meeting monthly and do it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| And that meeting may or may then therefore not even happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| You could tell them to come here and we will hear them and we will listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| And it then gets everybody in the room at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| Again, I'm championing what Peter's done with the building department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| to put those types of meetings together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| And if that can happen on a zoning level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| theoretically it could change your meeting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| I know it would be in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| but it would change your number of meetings in private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| And again, it shows, again, an outward effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| to keep this stuff in the public realm that's not behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| That again creates a good conversation about zoning development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| positive developments that are happening within our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| So again, that's where my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I think some of the voices I hear are that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| And I know how hard it is to get those meetings together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| And again, it costs money, all of our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| I might turn to our law department on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| I really think, John, what you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| is probably a role that was never envisioned for this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| because it really sounds more like it would turn the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| into a pre-screening group for potential ordinance amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| And that really becomes then, like, does the group vote up and down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| And it would add a whole new dynamic to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| I agree. It's a different, it's not this board anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| because this board's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| So it would be the next thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| So again, I think it's can it happen, should it happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| That's a philosophical question on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| And that may be a conversation I need to have with Amy, Stephanie, and Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| because if we were to continue the work of this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| I think that we would probably need some additional clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| and guidance from city council on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| because that would dramatically change the role of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| And I would ask the question of what's the role of planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| I mean, we have, you know, planning commission has had a specific role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| but they do provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| I mean, they're the ones who ultimately have to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| And a lot of those discussions could be pushed to that body specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| And there could be, you know, set up to where there's a workshop associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| So planning commission, nothing prevents them from having a subcommittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| to say, hey, we need to workshop this particular ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| or this set of ordinance amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| So that could happen with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| and I think that, you know, that would be a role that they could take on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| and then that recommendation go directly to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| That's just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| I really do think you're highlighting, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| some really important aspects of public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| So you're not – I don't even think we're disagreeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| I just think we're – yeah, how do we have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| either utilize our existing structures, which is what I would advocate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| because adding more layers is also costly for everybody's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| including the developer, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| But the intent is to ensure that there's a way to get feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| from all sorts of stakeholders, including just the person off the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| who is trying to get a project done on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| So, you know, we can – please feel free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| if anybody has any additional feedback about that, we will take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| And is there another light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| I'm sorry, Rick. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| It happens. It happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| I do want to just say, maybe just on a personal note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| because I think many of us have been sitting around these tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| for probably up to five or six years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| since the very beginning of the recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| We had the Stakeholder Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| This was like two or three jobs ago for me, so a lot of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| I think my role on the committee changed two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| I'm not officially part of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| but I really do want to say that I love working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| with every single person around this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| I think it sort of does feel like the end of an era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| We have been meeting for that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| You all know that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| We have been meeting for that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| that original Stakeholder Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| So I know we're going to continue to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| We all see each other on a pretty regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| So I'm lucky for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| I feel grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| But I just want to acknowledge the end of an era for this particular group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| but realize that we'll continue to be engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| and really just appreciate everybody's involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| Wayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Yeah, I was a little confused because I got a thank you letter from India| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| for serving on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| I don't know if anyone else did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| So, you know, which I assumed it was over at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| So I don't know where we really stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Government efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| You got the letter even before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| That was very efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| And I said this during the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| but to tag on to what Stephanie just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| so much has been accomplished by this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| I mean, it really has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| So I think that you all should be very proud of the work that you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| And it's been incredibly helpful for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| And what I would ask of you all going forward is, I mean, you can decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| We'll send out a follow-up email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| But, you know, when we do ordinance amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| we try to get them posted on our website early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| We try to get emails sent out and sending them out to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| And these are the ones that are probably more non-controversial of sending them out to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| and you all, you know, weigh in and contact us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| and help us make sure that we are getting adequate public input on these as they go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| And also being willing to participate in a more focused working group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| such as Amy did when we were tasked with tackling institutional science standards again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| That was incredibly helpful to have those stakeholders around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| So just encourage you all to please keep involved in the process and open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| All right. Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Thank you, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| And everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211216?start=3165)|
