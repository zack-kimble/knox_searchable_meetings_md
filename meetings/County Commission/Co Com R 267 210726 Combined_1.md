| 2:28:30| That wasn't the amendment that was put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| and then the resolution that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| We wholeheartedly support an update to general plan and growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8914)|
| 2:28:39| One of the reasons it's tough to do one without the other is they're tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| Mr. Murphy, I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8924)|
| 2:28:45| What happens if a community grows, changes, adapts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| or finds needs faster than a plan can handle, even at three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8929)|
| 2:28:57| I mean, we had this discussion the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| We're talking about a two-year process to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| Then you get on it, and then it's supposed to be looked at every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| What happens when governmental plans and consultants move at a glacial pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8948)|
| 2:29:13| and a community moves at a speedboat pace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8953)|
| 2:29:18| Yeah, so we're there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| We really have to, I think, dedicate the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| and time to do incremental updates to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| They're smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| If we're actually responding to the needs on a more rapid basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| we can do it versus a big update every 10 or 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| Is it not this body's responsibility to make decisions based upon a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8976)|
| 2:29:43| in its current state, not what we think it might be 20 years down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8983)|
| 2:29:50| I would absolutely want the body to think about the current state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8990)|
| 2:29:54| and in that to say that we really need to be doing these updates more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| We'd ask that these be done every three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| I think that would, and then that gives you enough stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| so that people know what the playing field is for the next upcoming years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| some sort of cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| Commissioner Dirk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| Yes, there is infrastructure in place due to Shannon Valley Farm being over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| and this is literally across the line into the 8th District from my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| I get the other side of Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| and so I'm very familiar with this property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| One thing that is not there as far as infrastructure goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| yes, Murphy is a major collector, but Old Tazewell Pike is a narrow road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| and especially that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| It is not the two-lane Old Tazewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| It is the other side of it, and I drove it yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| and there was a sign there that clearly says, caution, narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| So in looking at the land map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9049)|
| 2:30:55| it looks like most of the access to this property is on Old Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| and so my concern would be adding more congestion and to Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| more congestion, more traffic, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| And, again, we look at this one particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| and follow either commission or the developer's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9073)|
| 2:31:20| then it kind of sets a precedent to do we follow plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9080)|
| 2:31:26| And I do understand the argument of the piece mill, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| since we are so behind in updating our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9090)|
| 2:31:34| But my main concern is that road infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| or lack thereof, for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| I was on the MPC in 1990 when we started the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| and we worked on it all through my time on the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9113)|
| 2:31:59| We could never get it consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| We had to have the state government come in and put the plan on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9122)|
| 2:32:08| We didn't do the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| We couldn't get anybody to agree on the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| We knew we were growing and we had a plan we had to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| Finally, when it was passed, we put in that stipulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| that every three years it had to be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9139)|
| 2:32:24| It never was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| We didn't follow through on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| I wasn't on the commission at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| but we gave it to the MPC to do that kind of study, and they didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9151)|
| 2:32:38| So we're in this place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| We're either going to have to look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| if the plan was in place right now, how would that property be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| How would it be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| How would we do it if the plan had been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| and been revisited every three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| Would we have five units on that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| It's either yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| Would the roads that have been developed for it probably would have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| But there again, we're at this place right now that we've got to make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9186)|
| 2:33:11| and we're not going to make anybody happy with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| but we know what the public is demanding from us to live in affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9194)|
| 2:33:20| and that's a decision that we have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9200)|
| 2:33:25| Is there any more questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9205)|
| 2:33:28| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9208)|
| 2:33:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| Both these gentlemen make very compelling cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| The crux of this argument, the debate, seems to hinge on the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9216)|
| 2:33:46| the growth plan that designates this as being in a rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| and whether or not that growth plan is outdated or even still in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9230)|
| 2:33:57| That's kind of premised on the idea that if it were updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| this might not be a rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| because there's urban growth area across the street and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| As the planning commissioner that sits in this seat has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9248)|
| 2:34:11| I'm just an 8th district boy born and raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| and so I may be a little feeble-minded on these kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| but in my view, as one goes out Tazewell Pike into the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9257)|
| 2:34:23| once you pass Murphy Road, the areas to the east of Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9263)|
| 2:34:28| and north of Murphy Road are rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| They pretty much consist of Shannon Valley Farms and Century Farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9272)|
| 2:34:37| and Shannon Valley Farms is three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| I actually believe this is still a rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| and I'm not against development in rural areas by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9287)|
| 2:34:52| I did make an exception a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| As my colleagues may recall, I actually advocated to make an exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| and rezone a parcel in a rural area to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| but that was two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| This is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| I believe it's still a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| I would hope it would be a rural area if we redid the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9312)|
| 2:35:16| and so as the 8th district commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| my motion is to go with the staff recommendation at three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9319)|
| 2:35:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| A motion on the floor by Commissioner Beeler to follow staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| at three units an acre, seconded by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| Is there discussion on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| Seeing none, Madam Clerk, if you will call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9349)|
| 2:35:50| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| Since this is not what MPC mission approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9352)|
| 2:35:58| nor is it what the applicant requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| should we check with the applicant before we make the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9362)|
| 2:36:07| Applicants, welcome to say something if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9367)|
| 2:36:38| From the applicant's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| three dwelling units an acre just doesn't give them the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| to prepare a product in this environment for affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| so they would not be in favor of three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| They could make four dwelling units an acre work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| as the planning commission recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| but their preference would still be five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| given where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| I appreciate the opportunity to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9426)|
| 2:37:09| but we would still ask for, at a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| what the planning commission voted 13-2 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9432)|

| 2:37:46| There's a motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| it's a substitute motion, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| by Commissioner Smith to approve that staff recommendation of four units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9471)|

| 2:40:29| after the deadline, but essentially is the same as we, if somebody did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9629)|
| 2:40:35| show, we would give them the courtesy of moving that back a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=9635)|

| 2:49:46| and it was an amendment to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| let me get my notes out real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| just so that it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10193)|
| 2:50:04| So the Planning Commission had recommended adding OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| to the MUSD mixed-use special district EC03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| which is what this property currently resides in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10211)|
| 2:50:16| and that was denied at County Commission last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| So you're saying that essentially item number 63| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10220)|
| 2:50:23| should not, it can't happen regardless of a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| It cannot happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10227)|
| 2:50:28| So there are a couple options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| So it's to deny the request for the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10230)|
| 2:50:35| or remand it back to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| The only other option now would be to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| a plan amendment to OB Office to allow the rezoning to OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| So it could be sent back for further consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| and maybe brought back to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| or we could go ahead and vote on it tonight to deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| because we can't vote to approve it because that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| Because, yes, you don't have the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| if you want it to be consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| I'll look to the 8th District Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| for some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| Well, I'd like to offer a motion to deny this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| because it is not allowed under the current designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| and the County Commission has already denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10276)|
| 2:51:18| any amendment to that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| I'm going to open the floor for a motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| Commissioner Beeler with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| why wouldn't we remand this back to Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10293)|
| 2:51:40| If it was remanded back to Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| could the applicant find another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| or would they have to go back and start all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| for a different type of zoning request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| I guess what I'm getting to is by denying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| are we tying up somebody's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| where they can't make a decision on another use going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10314)|
| 2:51:58| or is that just a denial of this particular type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| and they just couldn't come back for this particular type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| I don't want to speak on behalf of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| in terms of what they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| I mean, there's other things that you can do with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| but we would need direction from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| of what you wanted us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| If you remand it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| OB is allowed in the office land use designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| and if you wanted to remand it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| that's what you should request Planning Commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| Does this make sense, sir, of what's going on right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| Yeah, it's been going on since November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10354)|
| 2:52:39| pardon the expression, jerked around, bounced back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10359)|
| 2:52:44| wasn't notified last month to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| or would have been here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10366)|
| 2:52:53| The whole use of this is for my tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| to be able to do something good for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| and that property's been in the family since the 1940s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10380)|
| 2:53:07| I don't think any of you all were alive in the 1940s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| to make a decision on it, call it agriculture or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10389)|
| 2:53:14| The property right next door we own as well is OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10394)|
| 2:53:20| and I sold off the third parcel down from it and the fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10400)|
| 2:53:30| because of what's happening here being run around in circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10410)|
| 2:53:35| My tenant can't do it, so I'm going to have to let them out of their lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10415)|
| 2:53:40| and I'll have to find something else to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10420)|
| 2:53:43| The county continuously wants to move around and keep shuffling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10423)|
| 2:53:50| and like I said, the tenant's been paying since November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10430)|
| 2:53:53| can't move in, can't do anything with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10433)|
| 2:53:56| and then just, like I said, move from one back and forth, back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10436)|
| 2:54:03| Most of you all are on the commission that approved to let it go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10443)|
| 2:54:12| Not been here in person, have had to come in via video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10452)|
| 2:54:16| but I can see everybody that's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10456)|
| 2:54:20| So my question is why can you not vote when it's one parcel to move it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10460)|
| 2:54:29| so it can be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| I've got Commissioner Bealey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| You kind of have the floor, but I also have two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| I yield to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| My question is for Amy Brooks, the director of Knox Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10482)|
| 2:54:49| The parcel he talks about, OB, was previously and grandfathered as OB, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10489)|
| 2:54:58| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| It's been OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| And OB's not allowed in the overlay plan for the Carter Community Center, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10501)|
| 2:55:10| Under the current plan designation, no, OB is not one of the zones that's considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10510)|
| 2:55:17| Mr. Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| That is exactly what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| This was due to the drug rehab going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10522)|
| 2:55:26| The plan amendment from planning to change this in the town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10526)|
| 2:55:32| it was overwhelmingly denied, and I will vote no on this one also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10532)|
| 2:55:40| So you'd rather make it a bar or another tobacco outlet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10540)|
| 2:55:45| Sir, you can do anything with it in the zoning that zoning allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| and planning will gladly tell you, code will gladly tell you what you can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10550)|
| 2:55:55| Mr. Bealey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| Back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| Motion's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10559)|
| 2:56:00| I believe it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10560)|
| 2:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10561)|
| 2:56:02| I just didn't know if you had any other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| So the current motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| This is item number 63 with a second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10566)|
| 2:56:12| All those in favor, by voting yes, you are voting to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10572)|
| 2:56:16| By voting no, you are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| That make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| One of those reverse votes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10583)|
| 2:56:24| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| Hope you find a use for your building, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10590)|

| 3:00:51| Following our rules, I think we have to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| We can move it to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10856)|

| 3:01:03| I recall when this was the first deferral was asked for at the request of Homestead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10863)|
| 3:01:17| They've asked to defer it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| Commissioners, I might note that Item 67 is also requested by Homestead Land Holdings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| and it's been requested to be deferred to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| There might be some confusion on behalf of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| that maybe they thought they were requesting deferral of both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| I don't know that for sure, but that's just maybe what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10896)|
| 3:01:40| I do believe Ms. Brooks is correct on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| because otherwise I feel certain that they would have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10903)|
| 3:01:46| Yeah, the properties aren't next to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10906)|
| 3:01:48| but if they were working off of 67 deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| then they might have just assumed both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| Would you like to make a motion, Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| We have to take some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10921)|
| 3:02:02| However, you are correct that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| ...that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10925)|
| 3:02:18| Ms. Brooks, the deferral...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| I am aware of the Hardin Valley one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| but there was no mention of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10948)|
| 3:02:33| No, not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10953)|
| 3:02:34| Is this the same company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10954)|
| 3:02:35| One says Homestead Land Holdings, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| and one says Homestead Land Holdings, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10957)|
| 3:02:42| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| I have them... Oh, you're correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| I would assume they're the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| I can look at the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| Let's look at the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10970)|
| 3:03:04| 66 was deferred from May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10984)|
| 3:03:07| and then deferred again in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10987)|
| 3:03:11| so this would actually be their first hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10991)|
| 3:03:17| but they're not attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| I believe our rules allow then for a pass for third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11002)|
| 3:03:27| until the next meeting, isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11007)|
| 3:03:29| It is, and there's a pretty...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| I mean, there's a pretty long precedence of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| trying to find an accommodating way for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11013)|
| 3:03:38| to use their land to a point in which it's not nefarious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| We have always tried to find an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11022)|
| 3:03:45| for someone to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11025)|
| 3:03:46| Are they the same company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| Yes, it's Russ Rackley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11028)|
| 3:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11029)|
| 3:03:50| I would like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| Can I ask you a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| Yeah, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11033)|
| 3:03:54| For Knox Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| Okay, this application was heard by Knox Planning in April, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11036)|
| 3:04:02| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11042)|
| 3:04:06| Okay, so it would have been on our May agenda hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11046)|
| 3:04:10| which they were a no-show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| Then they got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11052)|
| 3:04:13| No, no, they just asked for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11053)|
| 3:04:15| They asked for a deferral to June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| and then now they didn't show up here in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| They asked for two deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| This is the first time they've done a no-show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11065)|
| 3:04:28| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11068)|
| 3:04:29| So this would be the third time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11069)|
| 3:04:33| Well, it would be the third deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11073)|
| 3:04:36| but it would be the first time there was a no-show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11076)|
| 3:04:40| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11082)|
| 3:04:45| Sometimes you've got to read between the lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| and the spirit of the rule was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| we did not want developers showing up with large crowds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11089)|
| 3:04:52| asking for deferrals to try to wear out the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11092)|
| 3:04:57| I believe there's no opposition to this here tonight, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11097)|
| 3:05:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11101)|
| 3:05:05| So, Ms. Hill, you were about to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11105)|
| 3:05:09| I would like to make a motion that we defer this until the August agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11109)|
| 3:05:18| and I will do some checking in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11118)|
| 3:05:20| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11120)|
| 3:05:22| There's been a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11122)|
| 3:05:24| between the builder and the adjacent property owners about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11124)|
| 3:05:29| Ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| The motion is to defer to the August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11131)|
| 3:05:35| or defer one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11141)|
| 3:05:42| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11142)|
| 3:05:52| This will be deferred to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11152)|
| 3:05:56| Deferred to the August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| I want to clarify your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| Defer to the August meeting on 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| No, we deferred that at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11166)|
| 3:06:14| Okay, well, we're going to take action on 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| We'll clarify with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11176)|
| 3:06:19| Ms. Brooks, if we can follow up, let's get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11179)|
| 3:06:23| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11183)|
| 3:06:24| Okay, so we have deferred 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| Please check on 66 and 67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| If you would, please email the commissioners about that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11188)|
| 3:06:32| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11192)|
| 3:06:34| All right, going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11194)|
| 3:06:35| Does this commission want to take a quick bio break before we get into 59 and 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11195)|
| 3:06:42| I'm hearing yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11202)|
| 3:06:43| We will reconvene at 8.15 to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11203)|

| 3:07:52| The Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11272)|

| 3:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11283)|
| 3:08:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11286)|
| 3:08:07| This is the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| Mr. Mullins, would you like to start us off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| What I'm going to do is, Drusilla, if you'll put up a timer for 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11290)|
| 3:08:17| I'm going to just start with 10 minutes on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11297)|
| 3:08:22| We might reset the clock and do more, but I know we have a lot to discuss tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| So, Mr. Mullins, if you'll start us off, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11307)|

| 3:08:35| I'm here on behalf of the property owners, Home Federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| and the option holders on this property, Holrob Commercial Realty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| There are two applications before this commission tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11321)|
| 3:08:45| and they're hard to divorce one from the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| The first application is for the sector plan amendment from low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| to a mixed-use neighborhood center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11333)|
| 3:08:57| and then downzoning the property from planned commercial to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11337)|
| 3:09:02| As we can see from the number of people in the room tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| there's a lot of opposition to this property being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11345)|
| 3:09:09| and this is an important discussion, so I do appreciate the extra time that you've provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11349)|
| 3:09:15| There's been a lot that's been said about this rezoning at both the planning commission stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11355)|
| 3:09:19| and the multiple e-mails and telephone calls that, undoubtedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| you have received from the neighborhood and from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| and representatives of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| In trying to find a way to dive into this discussion first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11371)|
| 3:09:34| I think it's important to kind of go back and look at how this property got to where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11374)|
| 3:09:39| So if you'll indulge me, I want to go back to 1972, before I was born,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11379)|
| 3:09:45| when the Bexhill subdivision was first in its planning stages with the developer Century Homes, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11385)|
| 3:09:51| At that time, the developer put down a subdivision plat for all the homes in Bexhill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11391)|
| 3:09:58| and this property at that time were six lots along the front of Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11398)|
| 3:10:05| bounded also by Gatwick and Bexhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11405)|
| 3:10:11| In 1976, the developer looked at those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| and decided that they would be a good place for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11414)|
| 3:10:18| The developer actually filed an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| Lots of change. The application feedback in 1976 was $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11422)|
| 3:10:25| They charge us a lot more now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11425)|
| 3:10:28| The application was filed in 1976 for planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11428)|
| 3:10:32| and that was the recommended zone because at that time there was no neighborhood commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11432)|
| 3:10:37| and a planned commercial, whatever plan went forward, would have to go through a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11437)|
| 3:10:42| So because this was at the front of an established neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| that this developer was in the process of establishing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| then any potential impacts to the neighborhood could be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| and mitigated through the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11453)|
| 3:10:56| It was the most appropriate zone at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11456)|
| 3:10:59| In 1977, after the developer obtained the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| he went and actually put down deed restrictions on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| saying that it is designated for future commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11465)|
| 3:11:10| Those deed restrictions are still in place today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11470)|
| 3:11:13| Every deed from every resident in Bex Hill refers to the existing restrictions of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11473)|
| 3:11:22| and what that's referring to is the restrictions for your basic homeowners association restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11482)|
| 3:11:29| and this restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| In 1987, Weigels purchased the property as a potential location for one of his stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11492)|
| 3:11:39| He ultimately decided to go down the street where Marco's Pizza is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| right beside Bluegrass Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11502)|
| 3:11:45| But when he sold the property in 1998 to Home Federal for $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11505)|
| 3:11:51| he put down 25-year deed restrictions that prevented this property for 25 years at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11511)|
| 3:11:57| from being used to sell beer, gas, groceries, or a fast food restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11517)|
| 3:12:03| He was protecting his investment down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| Holrob intended to put a branch bank there, but times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| Internet banking is what it is now, and there's not a need for a brick-and-mortar branch location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11531)|
| 3:12:17| So in 2007, I believe, they engaged Holrob to attempt to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11537)|
| 3:12:24| The property was on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11544)|
| 3:12:26| Holrob's sign for sale for commercial property was in that field since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11546)|
| 3:12:33| Not once did the neighborhood approach Holrob about purchasing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11553)|
| 3:12:37| while this property was for sale during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| I suspect the market was depressed on this simply because of the deed restrictions Bill Weigel put on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11561)|
| 3:12:47| and that having a restaurant, having something where you could come in, drive through, fast food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11567)|
| 3:12:55| come in and get a beer and have a nice meal while you're going home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| or while you're picking your kids up from school or coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11579)|
| 3:13:02| there just wasn't a market for it because it was restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| And so as it looks like those deed restrictions are getting ready to fall off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11585)|
| 3:13:08| Holrob decided, you know what, we have tenants we can put on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11588)|
| 3:13:13| We can develop this for something that would make sense, that would serve the existing traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11593)|
| 3:13:19| It's on Ebenezer Road, which has a 70-foot right-of-way with 65 feet of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11599)|
| 3:13:27| Compare that to 1976 when it was rezoned, Ebenezer had 17 feet of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11607)|
| 3:13:33| So it grew up a lot since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| Now the commercial nodes, because of Pellissippi Parkway, pushed down into North Shore and onto Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11615)|
| 3:13:43| But as this area developed, there is a need for neighborhood commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| to serve the existing traffic that is there on Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11629)|
| 3:13:53| So when Holrob wanted to develop it, we looked and they approached the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11633)|
| 3:13:59| The planning staff said, yeah, you have planned commercial, wait a second, there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11639)|
| 3:14:03| Sector plan says low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11643)|
| 3:14:06| Sector plans were not initiated until after this zoning went into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11646)|
| 3:14:11| So the first one, I believe, was in 1982, revised in 86, 97, 2005, and 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11651)|
| 3:14:19| At no time in those sector plans was there any discussion about the existing commercial zoning on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11659)|
| 3:14:26| They just overlooked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| And that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11668)|
| 3:14:30| Either, at best, that's an oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11670)|
| 3:14:34| At worst, it's an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11674)|
| 3:14:36| But you look at even the planning staff's recommendation, they acknowledge that in their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| The sector plan failed to recognize the commercial zoning on the property, even though the zoning predates the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11681)|
| 3:14:47| And he goes on to say there is an error on the property regarding the consistency between the sector plan and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11687)|
| 3:14:53| And that's ultimately what planning commission decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11693)|
| 3:14:57| They said, look, at some point they should have addressed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11697)|
| 3:15:00| because you have existing zoning and you do a wholesale change of a sector plan and you change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11700)|
| 3:15:06| and there's no specific notice that you're going to change the rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11706)|
| 3:15:09| the existing rights for commercial property on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11709)|
| 3:15:13| There's no notice that goes out to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| Like there is in a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11715)|
| 3:15:16| People around you get a specific notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11716)|
| 3:15:18| When you're doing a sector plan, it's for a large region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11718)|
| 3:15:22| And individual property owners don't get notice of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| And quite frankly, for a long time the sector plans were treated as more guidelines and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11726)|
| 3:15:32| and something that has been valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| That has been corrected and it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| But the point of that is when you're looking at the criteria for correcting, for changing a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11736)|
| 3:15:41| you only have to meet one of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| And the first criteria listed is there is a significant or obvious error or omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11743)|
| 3:15:49| And unquestionably, that is what has occurred here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| It should have been addressed at some point over the past 49 years, and it hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11752)|
| 3:15:59| So we asked for a sector plan amendment to mixed-use neighborhood center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| The reason we asked for that is it's a fairly new sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| It's not utilized very much in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11767)|
| 3:16:10| It didn't come into place until the most recent sector plan amendment in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11770)|
| 3:16:15| But it allows for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11775)|
| 3:16:19| And if you look at the criteria for this specific sector plan, it says this is the criteria you have to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11779)|
| 3:16:28| for consideration for this sector plan in this sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11788)|
| 3:16:31| The property is a flat terrain, slopes generally less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11791)|
| 3:16:36| We meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11796)|
| 3:16:37| The property is currently served by a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| We meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11800)|
| 3:16:41| The location does not include auto and truck-oriented uses such as industrial strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| commercial and warehouse and distribution uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11805)|
| 3:16:48| There's none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11808)|
| 3:16:49| The property is located at an intersection of a local street and a thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11809)|
| 3:16:53| We meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11813)|
| 3:16:55| The property is next to low- or medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| We meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| So we meet all the location criteria for this sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11821)|
| 3:17:04| and that is also noted and captured in staff's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11824)|
| 3:17:12| For all these reasons, this was the reason why there was a lot of conversation about this in front of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11832)|
| 3:17:18| We understand there's a lot of emotion in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11838)|
| 3:17:23| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| Home Federal made the decision when they acquired the property, they were going to let the neighborhood use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| They mowed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11850)|
| 3:17:31| They would get calls from the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11851)|
| 3:17:32| hey, will you come and mow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11852)|
| 3:17:33| The grass is getting a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| They did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11855)|
| 3:17:36| They accommodated the neighborhood while they decided what can we do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11856)|
| 3:17:39| They shouldn't be punished for that by taking away a right that they have to develop this as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11859)|
| 3:17:47| Another factor I think this body needs to consider, the entire time this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11867)|
| 3:17:54| at least going back to 2004, which is as far back as the records go online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| I didn't dig any deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| The county has been assessing and appraising this property as commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11881)|
| 3:18:06| The property on Home Federal has been paying insurance, liability insurance, for commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11886)|
| 3:18:11| They've been paying this county taxes for commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11891)|
| 3:18:15| and the neighborhood behind us, sincere in what they want to do with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11895)|
| 3:18:22| they want to keep it as it is, but they're doing so at the detriment of my client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11902)|
| 3:18:28| the carrying costs and the commercial risks that they have taken throughout the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11908)|
| 3:18:32| and not once, even after this rezoning has started, have they made an offer on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11912)|
| 3:18:39| We've asked them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11919)|
| 3:18:40| We made a demand based upon what we expected, the realistic return of our investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11920)|
| 3:18:45| but we have communicated to them multiple times, everything is negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| Please make us an offer, and that hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| So we would ask that you follow Planning Commission's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11931)|
| 3:18:56| and approve the sector plan amendment from LDR to Mixed Use Neighborhood Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11936)|
| 3:19:02| which we meet the criteria for the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11942)|
| 3:19:06| we meet the criteria for the application of the plan to this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11946)|
| 3:19:10| and we would ask that you vote in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11950)|
| 3:19:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11954)|
| 3:19:15| I'll call on Megan Potts and Annie Svolto to join us at the podium, represent the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11955)|
| 3:19:24| If you would go ahead and both please state, if you're both going to speak, go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11964)|
| 3:19:28| Give us your name and address for the record, and then we can pick one of the two of you to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11968)|
| 3:19:33| Ann Marie Svolto, 1532 Bexhill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11973)|
| 3:19:38| Megan Wiley Potts, 8845 Nolo Drive, 37922 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11978)|
| 3:19:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11984)|
| 3:19:45| And you have the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11988)|
| 3:19:51| I'm going to speak briefly because Ms. Potts will be speaking directly about the adverse impact this proposal has on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=11991)|
| 3:20:03| I am opposed to Home Federal's application to rezone and amend the sector plan for 1401 Bexhill Drive, and I'm not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12003)|
| 3:20:11| I stand with all of these people here today who are also opposed to the rezoning and sector plan application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12011)|
| 3:20:17| As you can see, the community is united in this opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12017)|
| 3:20:24| And I will say that this crowd represents approximately 2,000 families in 13 neighborhoods along the Ebenezer Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12024)|
| 3:20:31| all of whom would be impacted by any change in the zoning and sector plan of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12031)|
| 3:20:37| The Bexhill subdivision is special, at least to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12037)|
| 3:20:44| A walk through the neighborhood on any given day, and you'll see families walking dogs, kids riding bikes, cats chasing squirrels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12044)|
| 3:20:51| and the homes sit on half-acre lots filled with towering oak trees and other gorgeous, mature landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12051)|
| 3:20:58| generations of crepe myrtles, azaleas, rose bushes, and honeysuckle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12058)|
| 3:21:04| There is a haven for birds, squirrels, and even a family of foxes, and you see it every day on your daily walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12064)|
| 3:21:12| At the heart of this neighborhood is a 2.5 small, 2.5-acre tract of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12072)|
| 3:21:18| All of these characteristics, the trees, the families, all of these are the characteristics that are the hallmarks of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12078)|
| 3:21:29| They are the characteristics of a low-density residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12089)|
| 3:21:33| And that is what the sector plan clearly recognizes, and it is what the zoning should recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12093)|
| 3:21:41| But as it stands today, the sector plan is correct, and I have to address briefly some of the remarks that Mr. Mullins made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12101)|
| 3:21:50| First, the sector plan was amended in 2017, and it clearly identifies the nature of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12110)|
| 3:21:58| The sector plan is concise, it's accurate, and it goes by what is actually existing in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12118)|
| 3:22:05| It noticed the half-acre lots, the residential area as far as Bluegrass Elementary being just a stone's throw away from the entrance of our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12125)|
| 3:22:16| It recognizes the sidewalks and the walkers and runners that go along Ebenezer every day, and that's what the sector plan recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12136)|
| 3:22:25| The sector plan also recognized the beauty of this field and actually recommended a pocket park, stating it would be an ideal location for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12145)|
| 3:22:34| Now, obviously, that might be ideal, but what the sector plan notices is right in line with the general plan of Knoxville-Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12154)|
| 3:22:43| And the sector plan identifies the true nature of this community, and it's the sector plan that got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12163)|
| 3:22:51| The zoning, the planned commercial zoning that exists on the property today, that's outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12171)|
| 3:22:57| But that zoning, and I have to be clear here because Mr. Mullins got this wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12177)|
| 3:23:01| Planned commercial was the zoning that arrived on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12181)|
| 3:23:06| It was rezoned before the houses were built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12186)|
| 3:23:09| The houses were built after that plot of land was designated as planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12189)|
| 3:23:14| And I think Mr. Mullins is right that when it was zoned as planned commercial, the projection was that there would be a need for commercial development because this was a growing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12194)|
| 3:23:23| And at the time, we certainly didn't have the North Shore Corridor and Kingston Pike and further down Westland as possible commercial nodes to service the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12203)|
| 3:23:33| But now we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12213)|
| 3:23:34| And so now we also have eight residential homes that immediately surround this 2.5-acre tract of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12214)|
| 3:23:40| And so it is imperative that the sector plan notice that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12220)|
| 3:23:44| The sector plan did not notice that there was nothing on the vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12224)|
| 3:23:49| The sector plan noticed what was there, what is there, and it is indisputably residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12229)|
| 3:23:54| And so we're asking that the commission also agree with the planning staff's recommendation, the professional staff's recommendation to deny the application on the grounds that there is no justification for amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12234)|
| 3:24:11| There are also legal requirements and criteria that Mr. Mullins didn't mention to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12251)|
| 3:24:18| None of which exist and none of which he can point to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12258)|
| 3:24:21| There are four requirements to rezone a piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| That even includes rezoning from planned commercial to mixed-use neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12264)|
| 3:24:29| And I would note that going from planned commercial to neighborhood commercial is not a down zone, as Mr. Mullins suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12269)|
| 3:24:39| If anything, at best, it's a lateral rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12279)|
| 3:24:42| It is not creating any greater protections for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12282)|
| 3:24:47| And so we would ask that the commission look at the requirements of the sector plan amendment that's listed in the Knoxville-Knox County general plan and the requirements to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12287)|
| 3:25:03| And while the history of this property shows that Home Federal allowed the community to continue to use it, Home Federal clearly made investment decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12303)|
| 3:25:13| And it is not the community that is punishing Home Federal for those investment decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12313)|
| 3:25:18| It's the nature of time changing the area in ways they did not predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12318)|
| 3:25:24| Home Federal could have built a branch in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12324)|
| 3:25:27| They did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12327)|
| 3:25:28| That was a calculated decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12328)|
| 3:25:30| They didn't build on it when they maybe could have, maybe when they should have, but who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12330)|
| 3:25:34| Maybe the best thing is that it stays exactly as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12334)|
| 3:25:37| But what we're asking is for the commission to look exactly at those criteria and the amendment criteria and notice that there is no legal justification to rezone or amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12337)|
| 3:25:49| I want to also make note of Hull Robb's some offers and so forth that we've been in discussions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12349)|
| 3:25:58| I know you all received communications from us and a summary of everything that has been discussed between Hull Robb, Home Federal, and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12358)|
| 3:26:06| What I can tell you for certainty is that Home Federal has never engaged in negotiations with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12366)|
| 3:26:13| I agree with Mr. Mullins to that extent, but you have to remember Bexhill is an unincorporated neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12373)|
| 3:26:21| It does not have a formal HOA that would be an appropriate arm to reach out to a commercial developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12381)|
| 3:26:28| There was no discussion that it was going to be developed in such a way that would be so antithetical to the very nature of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12388)|
| 3:26:36| Instead, we found about it after there was a conditional option by the person who was listing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12396)|
| 3:26:43| Hull Robb is the listing agent and the conditional purchaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12403)|
| 3:26:46| On Hull Robb's website just the other day, it still lists the property as for sale for $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12406)|
| 3:26:51| I would note that the offer that was originally on the table was given to us by Hull Robb for $1.95 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12411)|
| 3:26:59| That, by the way, is over $1.5 million more than the tax appraised value of $568,000 approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12419)|
| 3:27:09| Over $1.2 million above the asking price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12429)|
| 3:27:14| The community is not punishing Hull Robb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12434)|
| 3:27:17| The community is simply asking that this commission follow the sector plan and follow the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12437)|
| 3:27:25| There has been some suggestion that those plans are optional or maybe just suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12445)|
| 3:27:31| But they're not. They're promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12451)|
| 3:27:34| And they're promises that this commission adopted when they looked at what is important in deciding to change the existing zoning of any property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12454)|
| 3:27:41| And we ask that you look at those things and deny their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12461)|
| 3:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12465)|
| 3:27:51| Would you like to use the remaining two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12471)|
| 3:27:59| I speak to you tonight as a spokesman for my 348 Bexhill neighbors and approximately 1,700 additional families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12479)|
| 3:28:06| and 13 adjacent and nearby neighborhoods in the Ebenezer Road corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12486)|
| 3:28:11| The largest of these neighborhoods are Farmington, Bennington, Farrington, and Foxfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12491)|
| 3:28:16| We appreciate that many of you have come out to see the property and talk with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12496)|
| 3:28:22| You've received a comprehensive letter from us detailing the history and legal issues along with copies of documents and pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12502)|
| 3:28:29| We've detailed the arguments which support the recommendation of the professional planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12509)|
| 3:28:34| to deny the application for rezoning and the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12514)|
| 3:28:38| Because the criteria required by the Knox County zoning ordinance have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12518)|
| 3:28:43| I will focus my remarks on two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12523)|
| 3:28:46| One of the four required conditions for a rezoning as stated in Article 630.01 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12526)|
| 3:28:54| the proposed amendment shall not adversely affect any other part of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12534)|
| 3:28:59| nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12539)|
| 3:29:05| Article 5.38.01 general description for neighborhood commercial zone states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12545)|
| 3:29:12| quote, the commercial zoning district provides the opportunity to locate limited retail and service uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12552)|
| 3:29:19| in a manner convenient and yet not disruptive to the established residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12559)|
| 3:29:26| Development should be compatible with the character of the adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12566)|
| 3:29:30| We do not know what would actually be built on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12570)|
| 3:29:34| However, we know what the allowed uses are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12574)|
| 3:29:37| and that what the Hall Rob concept plan shows would have many adverse effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12577)|
| 3:29:42| In addition to retail stores, the concept plan shows two food establishments with drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12582)|
| 3:29:47| This would attract many vehicles during the day and night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| and create significant noise and lighting issues for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12590)|
| 3:29:54| particularly the houses closest to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12594)|
| 3:29:57| The entrances to the proposed development would be in close proximity to the driveways right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12597)|
| 3:30:05| The two entrances to the neighborhood already have traffic congestion and safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12605)|
| 3:30:10| Ebenezer Road is a heavily traveled road with a 45 mile an hour speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12610)|
| 3:30:15| and is part of the parental responsibility zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| as Bluegrass Elementary is just across the street and a block away from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12618)|
| 3:30:23| This development would add a large number of turn movements in and out of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12623)|
| 3:30:28| and would significantly increase the safety concerns for Bexhill residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12628)|
| 3:30:32| and all residing in the Ebenezer Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| Commercial development is not appropriate or compatible in the heart of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12635)|
| 3:30:40| and would be disruptive to the established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12640)|
| 3:30:44| This neighborhood did not exist 45 years ago when the 1976 ReZone to Plan commercial was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12644)|
| 3:30:51| The planning staff at that time noted in his recommendation to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12651)|
| 3:30:56| that there were buffers in place if commercial development were to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12656)|
| 3:31:00| because the owner owned all the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12660)|
| 3:31:03| That is no longer true as the original developers sold adjacent properties where houses are located today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12663)|
| 3:31:10| When Weigels owned the property from 1987 until 1988,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12670)|
| 3:31:16| it decided not to develop the property after noting enormous opposition from Bexhill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12676)|
| 3:31:21| and surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| When Weigels sold to Home Federal in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12683)|
| 3:31:26| a 25 year deed restriction was part of the warranty deed to prevent fast food restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12686)|
| 3:31:32| and the selling of beer, gas, and groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12692)|
| 3:31:35| The professional planning staff correctly states the requirements of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12695)|
| 3:31:40| The existing sector plan is clearly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12700)|
| 3:31:43| The pictures and the map prove this is a low density residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12703)|
| 3:31:48| that is fully developed except for this two acre property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12708)|
| 3:31:53| The zoning ordinance is not mere guidelines or suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12713)|
| 3:31:57| The legal requirements alone should be sufficient to deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12717)|
| 3:32:02| However, we ask that you also apply the concept of common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12722)|
| 3:32:07| We're not talking about commercial development a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12727)|
| 3:32:10| It would be located in the middle of a well-established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12730)|
| 3:32:14| We already have access to whatever commercial development we need on nearby North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12734)|
| 3:32:19| and Kingston Pike is only three miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12739)|
| 3:32:23| On March 31st, at a cold and rainy outdoor meeting requested by Home Federal Bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12743)|
| 3:32:28| attended by around 100 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12748)|
| 3:32:30| Home Federal Bank representatives told us they would not discuss selling the property to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12750)|
| 3:32:35| because of their conditional sales contract with Halrob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12755)|
| 3:32:39| On June 21st, 2021, Home Federal Bank said the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12759)|
| 3:32:43| and refused to request to provide to Bexhill a reasonable and specific selling price for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12763)|
| 3:32:51| Nothing has really changed since then from Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12771)|
| 3:32:56| Maintaining the status quo tonight would provide Bexhill and other residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12776)|
| 3:33:00| the opportunity to have future discussions with Home Federal Bank and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12780)|
| 3:33:05| to explore how this property can be appropriately used in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12785)|
| 3:33:08| Hopefully it could be maintained as a park to continue being a much appreciated benefit for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12788)|
| 3:33:14| A pocket park was recommended in the Southwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12794)|
| 3:33:19| We respectfully urge you to follow the planning staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12799)|
| 3:33:24| and deny the neighborhood commercial and proposed sector plan amendment to mixed-use neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12804)|
| 3:33:31| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12811)|
| 3:33:34| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12814)|
| 3:33:40| If you'll reset the clock to three minutes, I've provided an extra three minutes to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12820)|
| 3:33:47| We'll start with you, and after some additional thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12827)|
| 3:33:52| then we'll open up the floor for questions to either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12832)|
| 3:33:56| Thank you. Let me clarify the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12836)|
| 3:33:59| Home Federal legally cannot engage in negotiations with the neighborhood for the sale of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12839)|
| 3:34:04| because Hull Rob owns an option on the property, and they own the rights to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12844)|
| 3:34:10| Asking Home Federal to engage in negotiations would be asking them to breach their contract with Hull Rob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12850)|
| 3:34:17| and that has been explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| The person that is in charge, the person you have to engage with to purchase the property, is Hull Rob, not Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12859)|
| 3:34:27| Home Federal is involved in the conversations because they own the property, but they don't own the rights right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12867)|
| 3:34:33| So the offer that Hull Rob made is completely negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12873)|
| 3:34:38| Every portion of it is negotiable, and that was communicated time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12878)|
| 3:34:42| and we have not yet heard one offer from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12882)|
| 3:34:45| They want to save Bexhill Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12885)|
| 3:34:47| I understand that, but what is that worth to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12887)|
| 3:34:50| They have never told us what they are willing or able to pay to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12890)|
| 3:34:55| So regarding neighborhood commercial, Planning Commission unanimously approved the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12895)|
| 3:35:03| once they determined there was an error, an omission in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12903)|
| 3:35:08| and that we met the criteria for the sector plan for mixed-use neighborhood center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12908)|
| 3:35:13| When you look at the requirements for a rezoning that were referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12913)|
| 3:35:18| once you take the impediment of the sector plan off the table, we meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12918)|
| 3:35:24| When the neighborhood commercial zone, some parts of it they did not read that I want to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12924)|
| 3:35:31| it says it provides the opportunity to locate limited retail and service uses in a manner convenient to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12931)|
| 3:35:36| and yet not disruptive to an established residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12936)|
| 3:35:40| It's intended to provide reoccurring shopping and personal service needs of a nearby residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12940)|
| 3:35:45| It goes on to say the zoning should be generally placed at street intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12945)|
| 3:35:49| that include either a collector or arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12949)|
| 3:35:51| We meet that criteria here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| As close to the edge of the neighborhood as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| we meet that criteria for the neighborhood commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12955)|
| 3:35:58| The range of permitted uses is limited to those that are generally patronized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12958)|
| 3:36:01| on a frequent basis by neighborhood residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12961)|
| 3:36:04| Development performance standards are provided to maximize compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12964)|
| 3:36:07| between commercial uses and adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12967)|
| 3:36:10| And the uses that we are talking about, that HOLROM is intended to place on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12970)|
| 3:36:16| they have to go through a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12976)|
| 3:36:18| There will have to be a traffic study to determine what's the best way to access this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12978)|
| 3:36:24| We've talked about accessing off of Ebenezer versus off of the two side streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12984)|
| 3:36:29| and that is a conversation that will occur both with engineering and with planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12989)|
| 3:36:35| and with the planning commission as we go through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12995)|
| 3:36:39| It is intended to mitigate any potential adverse occurrences with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=12999)|
| 3:36:47| So we meet the criteria for the rezoning as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13007)|
| 3:36:51| and that is even the commissioners who are opposed to the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13011)|
| 3:36:56| recognize that and voted unanimously in favor of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| So I would ask that you follow that as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| I want to just remind our commissioners this is two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13025)|
| 3:37:08| Right now we are debating and asking about the county sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13028)|
| 3:37:13| The rezoning is a different vote on a different file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13033)|
| 3:37:18| So open the floor to discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13038)|
| 3:37:20| Commissioner Ward, this is your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13040)|
| 3:37:22| You're more than welcome to start us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13042)|
| 3:37:24| Anybody else can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13044)|
| 3:37:25| I'll wait to hear from my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| Are there questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13047)|
| 3:37:31| I have a couple, but I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| Mr. Bussling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13055)|
| 3:37:39| Why did MPC come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13059)|
| 3:37:42| I guess it's because of the zoning that you had to have the sector change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13062)|
| 3:37:45| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13065)|
| 3:37:49| I'm not sure what the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| There's zoning to the property that will always remain with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13071)|
| 3:37:55| And to use the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| did they have to come back before you get the sector plan to use it as commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13077)|
| 3:38:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13083)|
| 3:38:04| So the property is zoned planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13084)|
| 3:38:06| In order to move forward with any development under that zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13086)|
| 3:38:12| they have to comply with 6.50.06 of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13092)|
| 3:38:18| And it provides that in reviewing a use on review application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13098)|
| 3:38:21| the planning commission shall be guided by the policies of the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13104)|
| 3:38:27| So it has to comply with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| the use that's being proposed under the plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13109)|
| 3:38:33| Is that the owner's, the owner had the property long before it was zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13113)|
| 3:38:38| I mean for commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13118)|
| 3:38:40| and it was not their fault that they didn't know that they couldn't use it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13120)|
| 3:38:46| Who was the responsibility to let the owner know how the land was zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13126)|
| 3:38:52| This precedes my time here at Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13132)|
| 3:38:57| This is a challenging one for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| and one that internally we struggled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13140)|
| 3:39:02| and I know the planning commission did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13142)|
| 3:39:05| So as of right now the land is useless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| You couldn't use it anyway, right, for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13147)|
| 3:39:14| You know, in order to comply with the section that I just referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13154)|
| 3:39:18| they would need to request a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13158)|
| 3:39:21| But wouldn't they be grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13161)|
| 3:39:25| Not according to this section in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13165)|
| 3:39:30| But that's part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13170)|
| 3:39:31| That's part of what, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13171)|
| 3:39:36| Ms. Brooks, just for clarification on that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13176)|
| 3:39:39| it was referenced that there was an error in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13179)|
| 3:39:44| and it was admitted by the planning department that it was overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13184)|
| 3:39:50| Can you help me understand that and what year that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13190)|
| 3:39:54| I can't speak to what year it was because this was rezoned in 76, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13194)|
| 3:40:01| The sector plan, I guess, was in 2017?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13201)|
| 3:40:04| 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13204)|
| 3:40:05| 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13205)|
| 3:40:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13206)|
| 3:40:07| So can you talk about the error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13207)|
| 3:40:10| Well, the sector plan didn't recognize the zoning on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13210)|
| 3:40:13| I mean, it's debatable which one is an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13213)|
| 3:40:18| You know, over time, the plans have moved forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13218)|
| 3:40:23| and they have never recognized that it's PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13223)|
| 3:40:26| And this is fairly unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13226)|
| 3:40:28| We don't see a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13228)|
| 3:40:29| I can't speak to why staff previously never recognized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13229)|
| 3:40:35| Again, we wouldn't initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| So even if it was recognized and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13237)|
| 3:40:40| there was a position taken by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13240)|
| 3:40:43| that it needed to be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13243)|
| 3:40:46| that wouldn't be something that the planning commission would initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13246)|
| 3:40:49| It would stay with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13249)|
| 3:40:50| Yeah, that would fall with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13250)|
| 3:40:52| I mean, that's not something that I'm aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13252)|
| 3:40:54| that the planning commission has ever initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13254)|
| 3:40:57| I just want to be really clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13257)|
| 3:40:58| because this is where the layers of plans get really confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13258)|
| 3:41:02| It was commercial at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13262)|
| 3:41:05| Before plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13265)|
| 3:41:06| Before plans existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13266)|
| 3:41:07| And then it was planned commercial in 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13267)|
| 3:41:14| And that zoning stayed forever until sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13274)|
| 3:41:19| which is a policy statement, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13279)|
| 3:41:23| started being added above that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13283)|
| 3:41:26| and didn't recognize that this thing had been this ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13286)|
| 3:41:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13290)|
| 3:41:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13294)|
| 3:41:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13297)|
| 3:41:40| Amy, in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13300)|
| 3:41:41| it clearly states that the staff recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13301)|
| 3:41:45| How did they not see the error and omission in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13305)|
| 3:41:50| and its contradiction with what is actually zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13310)|
| 3:41:55| Well, the planning commission determined that there was an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13315)|
| 3:41:59| I think from, you know, planning staffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13319)|
| 3:42:01| That's the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13321)|
| 3:42:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13322)|
| 3:42:03| So I think it would say planning staff really struggled with this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| of determining where the error occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13326)|
| 3:42:09| Since it's been so out of line for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13329)|
| 3:42:13| I think it's difficult to point to, you know, where the error is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13333)|
| 3:42:19| Does it matter if an error occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| It's just a simple fact that an error, not when, but that it occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13341)|
| 3:42:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13346)|
| 3:42:29| Given the two zonings, PC and neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13349)|
| 3:42:35| which one of those provides the most protection and oversight for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13355)|
| 3:42:39| residents in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13359)|
| 3:42:42| The planned commercial zone doesn't designate specific uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13362)|
| 3:42:47| Those are all determined once a plan is submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13367)|
| 3:42:51| and evaluated by planning staff and the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13371)|
| 3:42:54| So in that regard, it's kind of an open, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13374)|
| 3:42:59| in terms of what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13379)|
| 3:43:01| The neighborhood commercial zone really is intended to be more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13381)|
| 3:43:06| with established residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13386)|
| 3:43:09| And the planned commercial zone also requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13389)|
| 3:43:11| or typically requires a larger acreage than this property currently has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13391)|
| 3:43:17| So planned commercial recommends up to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13397)|
| 3:43:19| This one is significantly less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13399)|
| 3:43:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13402)|
| 3:43:23| But it did at the time, I assume, met the PC requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13403)|
| 3:43:27| They didn't have the neighborhood commercial zone back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13407)|
| 3:43:30| Potentially, I'm not 100% sure, but that's something we could look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13410)|
| 3:43:35| It's odd things like this happen, and I'll give a little personal story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13415)|
| 3:43:38| I never share anything personal up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13418)|
| 3:43:41| My family started a business in 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| We built a piece of commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13425)|
| 3:43:48| We ran that business for 30 years, sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13428)|
| 3:43:51| It's still there as a piece of commercial property operating as the same type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13431)|
| 3:43:55| of business as when we had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13435)|
| 3:43:58| I was curious as to what it was in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13438)|
| 3:44:01| I went back and looked, and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13441)|
| 3:44:03| It's ALDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13443)|
| 3:44:06| I'm just wondering how many of these errors and omissions we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13446)|
| 3:44:10| when we do these layovers of sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13450)|
| 3:44:14| Do we go in and look tightly at existing zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13454)|
| 3:44:22| That would be the expectation, that we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13462)|
| 3:44:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13465)|
| 3:44:28| Commissioner Bieler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13468)|
| 3:44:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13470)|
| 3:44:33| Sorry, I was muted. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13473)|
| 3:44:36| I don't mean to belabor this point, but I think, Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13476)|
| 3:44:40| you kind of already answered it in terms of your tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13480)|
| 3:44:46| Maybe Mr. Snowden, maybe one of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13486)|
| 3:44:50| Has there ever been a documented case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13490)|
| 3:44:56| where the sector plan deliberately disregarded a zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13496)|
| 3:45:05| I know there have been some errors and omissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13505)|
| 3:45:08| but has there ever been a case where the sector plan was put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13508)|
| 3:45:15| and deliberately disregarded the zoning of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13515)|
| 3:45:18| I don't have any precedent for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13518)|
| 3:45:25| Are you asking me to answer this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| I'm asking anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| Maybe Commissioner Schoenberg or somebody who deals with these kinds of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13529)|
| 3:45:33| or has some experience with these kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13533)|
| 3:45:36| Well, I mean, we just heard one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13536)|
| 3:45:38| Well, but it wasn't deliberate is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| I wouldn't think it was deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| I would think that it was just an omission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| It was an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13545)|
| 3:45:46| Somebody didn't pay attention to the fact that that parcel was zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13546)|
| 3:45:50| Is there any situation where it was documented in the notes by the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13550)|
| 3:45:55| hey, we saw this zoning, but we chose to disregard it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13555)|
| 3:46:01| and put this sector plan designation down anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13561)|
| 3:46:07| Commissioner Buehler, I'm not aware of any notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| I mean, it's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13569)|
| 3:46:10| And, for instance, with this particular plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13570)|
| 3:46:13| the lead staff is no longer with our agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| and I would say that probably for many of our plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13575)|
| 3:46:18| with the exception of one that's been done in recent times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13578)|
| 3:46:20| We have a staff member who's currently with us who can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13580)|
| 3:46:24| But I apologize, I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13584)|
| 3:46:27| But it's a really good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| and I wouldn't be surprised if there were cases where there was a thought process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13589)|
| 3:46:36| that that zone wasn't appropriate anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13596)|
| 3:46:41| Ms. Brooks, before I continue on with our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13601)|
| 3:46:45| when a sector plan is created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13605)|
| 3:46:47| this I think was brought up by maybe Commissioner Buehler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13607)|
| 3:46:51| is there a legal requirement to notify the landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13611)|
| 3:46:56| that their land might be designated something different in a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13616)|
| 3:47:02| when that is put in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13622)|
| 3:47:04| When we rezone a piece of property, when we do an assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13624)|
| 3:47:08| there's a bunch of things we have to provide a legal notice to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13628)|
| 3:47:12| But in a sector plan that's created and adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13632)|
| 3:47:15| is there any legal requirement to tell the landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13635)|
| 3:47:18| hey, by the way, you're part of a new sector plan with a different designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13638)|
| 3:47:22| Not beyond the typical noticing requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13642)|
| 3:47:25| that are required to move through the legislative process to get a plan adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13645)|
| 3:47:30| Commissioner Skinneker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13650)|
| 3:47:32| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13652)|
| 3:47:35| These questions are for Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13655)|
| 3:47:41| You said there were deed restrictions that were placed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13661)|
| 3:47:45| When do those expire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13665)|
| 3:47:48| There are two sets of deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13668)|
| 3:47:50| The restrictions that Mr. Weigel placed on the property in 1998 were 25-year restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13670)|
| 3:47:56| so that's what asked me to do math in public, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13676)|
| 3:48:01| It's in the near future from a development timeline standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13681)|
| 3:48:05| The restrictions that the developer put on the property, Century Homes, in 1977,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13685)|
| 3:48:12| they don't have an expiration date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13692)|
| 3:48:15| I was curious on the Weigel's ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13695)|
| 3:48:18| Also, you represent Holrob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13698)|
| 3:48:22| and in your professional opinion, do you think that they are very professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13702)|
| 3:48:30| in their field of commercial development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13710)|
| 3:48:35| I do feel like they are professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13715)|
| 3:48:39| What's unique in this, up until I think the first time there was an issue of a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13719)|
| 3:48:47| not matching the zoning and what do we do with this, I think this came up two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| Before, they were treated almost as recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13730)|
| 3:48:53| so this is something that I think staff and the legal department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13733)|
| 3:48:57| have been paying more attention to, that restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13737)|
| 3:49:00| And you had stated that Holrob had posted a sign on the property, I think you said in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13740)|
| 3:49:07| It was either 2007, 2009, when they first started listing the property for sale for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13747)|
| 3:49:15| And then the sector plan was updated in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13755)|
| 3:49:21| And if Holrob knew that they were going to still continue to market this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13761)|
| 3:49:28| and they had some deed restrictions that expired in 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13768)|
| 3:49:32| how many members of their team attended the sector plan meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13772)|
| 3:49:36| to make sure that their property and what they knew it was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13776)|
| 3:49:41| to make sure that that followed through with the designations that they wanted to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13781)|
| 3:49:45| I don't know whether or not anyone did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13785)|
| 3:49:47| I don't know if they were aware that there was even a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13787)|
| 3:49:50| that their sector plan was incongruous with the planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13790)|
| 3:49:55| and if that would have any significant legal effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13795)|
| 3:49:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13799)|
| 3:50:00| And I just need some clarification on the letter that you sent to all commissioners on July 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13800)|
| 3:50:06| In your first paragraph, you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13806)|
| 3:50:08| Prior to the May 21, 2021 Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13808)|
| 3:50:12| an offer by Holrob was conveyed to representatives of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13812)|
| 3:50:15| offering to sell its interest in the property for $1,950,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13815)|
| 3:50:20| As the representative for Holrob, are you the one that presented this to the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| No, I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| We had a meeting with, I think, Chairman Jay had a meeting with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13827)|
| 3:50:34| and talked about potentially purchasing the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13834)|
| 3:50:37| and then Commissioner Jay then approached us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13837)|
| 3:50:40| would you be willing to make an offer to sell the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13840)|
| 3:50:44| which we then looked at what we expected looking at how much our purchase price was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13844)|
| 3:50:49| how much carrying costs and costs we've had into moving forward with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13849)|
| 3:50:56| and then what a reusable rate of return we would expect to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13856)|
| 3:50:59| That's what the property is worth to Holrob with its current option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13859)|
| 3:51:03| We conveyed that to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| Commissioner Jay conveyed that to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13865)|
| 3:51:08| Thereafter, all the communications have been between the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13868)|
| 3:51:11| and myself as representatives of Holrob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13871)|
| 3:51:14| Okay, so in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13874)|
| 3:51:16| Chairman Jay was not acting as a representative for Holrob during these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13876)|
| 3:51:21| He was just simply trying to offer an opportunity for the community to speak with a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13881)|
| 3:51:29| Yeah, I mean, I was trying to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13889)|
| 3:51:31| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13891)|
| 3:51:32| A facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13892)|
| 3:51:34| In the meeting, I guess let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13894)|
| 3:51:37| I'm sorry, I forgot your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13897)|
| 3:51:39| Annie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13899)|
| 3:51:40| Annie, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13900)|
| 3:51:41| Let me just ask you, Annie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13901)|
| 3:51:42| Okay, so were you present in the meeting when the proposal was made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13902)|
| 3:51:46| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13906)|
| 3:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13907)|
| 3:51:48| So it was you and Megan and Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13908)|
| 3:51:52| and was it just three of you all present in the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13912)|
| 3:51:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13915)|
| 3:51:56| I can tell you that it was Ms. Potts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13916)|
| 3:51:59| and other representatives from our community to include Lissetta Viles and Anita Morgan and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13919)|
| 3:52:08| and Mr. Jay and Commissioner Ward was also present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13928)|
| 3:52:12| Okay, so we had two commissioners presenting a proposal to the neighborhood then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13932)|
| 3:52:17| or was this just an information gathering session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13937)|
| 3:52:21| Because you understand there's two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13941)|
| 3:52:25| Two commissioners cannot meet without public notice and discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13945)|
| 3:52:31| Yes, this was the meeting as we understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13951)|
| 3:52:35| and we were aware of two commissioners being present at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13955)|
| 3:52:40| We were surprised to see that ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| I can tell you that our discussion was on presenting a proposal from Hull Rock that Commissioner Jay represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13962)|
| 3:52:48| He had had conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13968)|
| 3:52:51| The basic details of the proposal was represented to our group at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13971)|
| 3:52:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13975)|
| 3:52:56| And then did you feel it was your responsibility to keep coming back to the applicant to present counteroffers and counteroffers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13976)|
| 3:53:05| Did you feel that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13985)|
| 3:53:07| So the request, once we got the full details in an email from Commissioner Jay the following morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13987)|
| 3:53:14| which was a Tuesday morning less than one week before the May 24th commissioners' meeting where this was up for a vote back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=13994)|
| 3:53:23| That morning the details of the proposal were relayed to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14003)|
| 3:53:26| and the proposal indicated that it would be between the homeowners and Hull Rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14006)|
| 3:53:32| We understood that Hull Rock had an option that was conditioned upon them successfully rezoning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14012)|
| 3:53:38| One of the primary conditions of the initial offer, at least that was what was represented to us at various times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14018)|
| 3:53:43| that Hull Rock's condition, whatever their conditions were, in part rested on being able to develop it as they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14023)|
| 3:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14031)|
| 3:53:52| Part of the negotiation, excuse me, the offer was that we would waive our right to oppose any zoning requests to rezone at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14032)|
| 3:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14043)|
| 3:54:04| And then we had less than four full days to accept or counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14044)|
| 3:54:09| We chose not to counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14049)|
| 3:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14050)|
| 3:54:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14051)|
| 3:54:12| Since I think you're trying to insinuate that there was some malfeasance going on, I want to explain exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14052)|
| 3:54:19| Who are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14061)|
| 3:54:22| No, I'm asking what happened at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14062)|
| 3:54:25| I'm going to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14065)|
| 3:54:26| She actually said that you were present and Commissioner Ward was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14066)|
| 3:54:29| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14069)|
| 3:54:30| That was not implying anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14070)|
| 3:54:32| I'm just asking what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14072)|
| 3:54:34| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14074)|
| 3:54:37| It's weird to stick to the topic of the SECA plan, not third-party negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14077)|
| 3:54:43| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14083)|
| 3:54:44| However, I'm going to take a minute to try to find, to explain what was hopefully going to be a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14084)|
| 3:54:52| So long ago, many of us have driven by this property, and I think many of us have said, gosh, wouldn't that be a nice little park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14092)|
| 3:55:03| I think everybody's done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14103)|
| 3:55:05| When it was clear that this was coming to commission or coming before us, clear that there was opposition but there wasn't a dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14105)|
| 3:55:15| I did reach out because I do try to find solutions and help communities find paths through things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14115)|
| 3:55:22| We all do that as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14122)|
| 3:55:25| I reached out to the team at Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14125)|
| 3:55:29| I reached out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14129)|
| 3:55:30| They said, we have a contract with Hull Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14130)|
| 3:55:33| Said, okay, let's sit down, talked many times to our representatives, and understood both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14133)|
| 3:55:41| And I tried to find a path forward for both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| So I sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14143)|
| 3:55:44| There wasn't dialogue between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14144)|
| 3:55:46| Simply tried to be a mediator and bring some potential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14146)|
| 3:55:52| And so I did meet with Hull Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14152)|
| 3:55:54| I did meet with Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14154)|
| 3:55:55| I tried to find what is a way that might satisfy the needs of the community and the wants of the community who clearly want this to be a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14155)|
| 3:56:02| What might be the solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| And the solution with property rights is you buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14164)|
| 3:56:07| Very often we have this discussion all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14167)|
| 3:56:11| And so I did ask to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14171)|
| 3:56:13| We did not deliberate between two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14173)|
| 3:56:16| We asked to meet, and I said, I'm happy to present to you an offer to try to find a solution forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14176)|
| 3:56:22| Commissioner Ward was there, but we did not deliberate on the subject, which is perfectly legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14182)|
| 3:56:26| He heard exactly what I said, and I presented the information very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14186)|
| 3:56:31| They said, we would be happy to sell it to you to become a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14191)|
| 3:56:34| Here is the price that we feel represents the cost of our purchase, the cost of our investment, and the cost of our opportunity going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14194)|
| 3:56:43| And I did say, it's negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14203)|
| 3:56:45| Find a way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| They are willing to sell it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| If you want this to be a park, what is it worth to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| I keep hearing, we have 1,700 families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14211)|
| 3:56:54| We have 2,000 families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14214)|
| 3:56:56| We have 13 different neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14216)|
| 3:56:58| But it has from day one been represented as this is an open negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14218)|
| 3:57:04| Tell them what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14224)|
| 3:57:06| Find a way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14226)|
| 3:57:07| I even offered to, I said, look, do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14227)|
| 3:57:10| If there's this many people and everybody threw in a couple of bucks to get the game started, you could delay this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14230)|
| 3:57:16| You could do a fundraising campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14236)|
| 3:57:18| I even offered to write the first check on behalf of your group to say, yes, I would love to see it at a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14238)|
| 3:57:25| I'll help you fundraise, and let's find a way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14245)|
| 3:57:28| But time and time again, negotiations are only one-sided, where Paul Robb, who is the legal right to the property, has said, tell us what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14248)|
| 3:57:38| other than to just give you the land, which seems to be kind of the sentiment here, and let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14258)|
| 3:57:44| So, yeah, I've tried to find many different ways forward, but we are a county that has property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14264)|
| 3:57:52| and those property rights are not based upon feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14272)|
| 3:57:55| They are based upon the law, and we have somebody who has been a legal property owner for decades and decades and decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14275)|
| 3:58:03| and has finally found a buyer, and we have somebody who has a legal right to the land and is trying to move forward with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14283)|
| 3:58:13| and is offered to sell it or to move forward, and that is where we're at a stalemate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14293)|
| 3:58:19| So we've tried to find many different ways, but there doesn't seem to be a way forward, and so here we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14299)|
| 3:58:26| And at the end of the day, we have to look at what are the laws we have in the books, are there errors to certain policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14306)|
| 3:58:33| and who has the rights to make decisions about their land going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14313)|
| 3:58:38| And to this day, there's still options to buy it, but there doesn't seem to be a return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14318)|
| 3:58:42| So I'd like to just explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14322)|
| 3:58:44| I'm going to continue to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14324)|
| 3:58:45| I'm sure we'll ask for more dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14325)|
| 3:58:47| Commissioner Bussler, you were up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14327)|
| 3:58:53| Mr. Daley, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14333)|
| 3:58:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14335)|
| 3:58:58| I'm kind of shocked that two commissioners would meet knowing that we have to have a 48-hour sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14338)|
| 3:59:07| This is a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14347)|
| 3:59:08| They know that they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14348)|
| 3:59:10| We know that they tried to negotiate a $1.9 million sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14350)|
| 3:59:15| Is that legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14355)|
| 3:59:18| I'm the only one that represented information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14358)|
| 3:59:22| Was Commissioner Ward there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14362)|
| 3:59:25| I would like to get back on point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14365)|
| 3:59:26| That's not the point of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14366)|
| 3:59:28| Well, let's go and notice that there's questionable acts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14368)|
| 3:59:37| I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14377)|
| 3:59:38| This is about a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14378)|
| 3:59:39| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14379)|
| 3:59:42| Well, now let's see if we can get back to a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14382)|
| 3:59:47| We are a quasi-judicial branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14387)|
| 3:59:50| What is presented to us are certain facts, and we're going to have to rule on those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14390)|
| 3:59:57| There's been mistakes made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14397)|
| 4:00:01| I'm going to throw this out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14401)|
| 4:00:12| We as commissioners know our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14412)|
| 4:00:15| In my district, I found two or three situations in the seven years I've been on commission that has been not zoned properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14415)|
| 4:00:23| and we have got them back in zone properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14423)|
| 4:00:27| This has been when I first got on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14427)|
| 4:00:31| If we knew this problem was going on and it was in your commission district, I know you're new, Mr. Ward, and I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14431)|
| 4:00:38| but if you knew this was going on, we should have been working on these problems and taking care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14438)|
| 4:00:47| And it seems like it always comes back to us to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14447)|
| 4:00:51| Now, here's the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14451)|
| 4:00:53| The zoning stays with the property regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14453)|
| 4:00:57| The owner of the property decides if he wants the zoning to change or not, not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14457)|
| 4:01:03| If they decide right now that we're going to leave it like it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14463)|
| 4:01:07| and we're going to use that commercial whatever we can use on that as commercial property, it is up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14467)|
| 4:01:14| He goes and files a plan, and the plans are acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14474)|
| 4:01:19| Mr. Snowden, I'm going to ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14479)|
| 4:01:22| Since you're down there, I want you to earn some money tonight, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14482)|
| 4:01:26| If they come in with a proper plan that will fit underneath that commercial zoning, you have no way of denying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14486)|
| 4:01:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14497)|
| 4:01:40| I may have to have Amy help me with this, but it's my understanding the zoning ordinance says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14500)|
| 4:01:45| anything in a planned zone requires them to sign off before we issue a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14505)|
| 4:01:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14512)|
| 4:01:53| Anything in a planned commercial zone requires a use on review, which would go to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14513)|
| 4:01:57| Okay, so it is planned commercial zoning right now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14517)|
| 4:02:03| So all they have to do is do a correct plan and go there and do whatever they want to with the property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14523)|
| 4:02:10| Not without the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14530)|
| 4:02:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14532)|
| 4:02:14| But their grandfather did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14534)|
| 4:02:17| Now, the problem is with the PC zoning, if they apply for anything, they can't use it as PC because the sector plan says it's LDR, no matter what their plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14537)|
| 4:02:30| But you gave an example, too, that yours was LDR and you used planned commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14550)|
| 4:02:35| I don't know what would ever happen if that building burned down, what they might make you do to put it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14555)|
| 4:02:39| Yeah, but anyway, we've got a situation between the community and a property owner, and we've got to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14559)|
| 4:02:51| And it is our decision that will stick on this, but we've got to do something about not coming up with this kind of stuff again for us under zonings and planning and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14571)|
| 4:03:08| We ought to know about all these things and take a look at the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14588)|
| 4:03:20| We ought to really look at how we can correct these problems before they ever get to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14600)|
| 4:03:26| And I'm probably going to bring that up in the rules committee, but we should not be in this place right now where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14606)|
| 4:03:32| because we've known, somebody has, because you can look on the deed and it says planned commercial for that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14612)|
| 4:03:43| It doesn't say sector plan denies that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14623)|
| 4:03:49| But if you've got that deed for that piece of property, what would it say on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14629)|
| 4:03:54| It would say planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14634)|
| 4:03:58| And I don't like to be caught in situations like this, and I think we need to, after this is over with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14638)|
| 4:04:03| we need to find out how we can correct this in situations to where we don't have to face this and make people mad on both sides of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14643)|
| 4:04:12| Commissioner Vicks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14652)|
| 4:04:14| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14654)|
| 4:04:15| Director Brooks, I was looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14655)|
| 4:04:18| Can you refresh me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14658)|
| 4:04:19| Is there any kind of criteria for buffering on the current planned commercial zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14659)|
| 4:04:24| I was trying to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14664)|
| 4:04:25| I'm trying to scour through your website, and I can't find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14665)|
| 4:04:30| Yes, let me look in 5.33, which is planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14670)|
| 4:04:35| There is a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14675)|
| 4:04:42| I don't want to misspeak, but I think it's 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14682)|
| 4:04:48| And what's the setback off of Ebenezer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14688)|
| 4:04:58| The setback for a building off of Ebenezer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14698)|
| 4:05:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14704)|
| 4:05:05| It just depends on what they end up planning to build in terms of if they were to come under the planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14705)|
| 4:05:13| depending on what they would propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14713)|
| 4:05:16| There's a peripheral boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14716)|
| 4:05:17| All buildings shall be set back at least 50 feet from any peripheral boundary of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14717)|
| 4:05:22| or any public street or road existing prior to the PC planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14722)|
| 4:05:27| I'm just trying to wrap around my mind the setback as well as the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14727)|
| 4:05:32| I'm trying to paint that picture in my mind on this current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14732)|
| 4:05:35| The planned commercial would be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14735)|
| 4:05:38| To develop this piece of property under a planned commercial would be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14738)|
| 4:05:42| Again, under 5.3304, it says the intent of the planned commercial zone is to provide the best design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14742)|
| 4:05:49| and coordinated arrangement of commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14749)|
| 4:05:51| It is not likely, therefore, that a planned commercial development would contain less than 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14751)|
| 4:05:55| Of course, we see them that are less than 20 acres, but the code specifies that that is a minimum that should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14755)|
| 4:06:06| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14766)|
| 4:06:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14769)|
| 4:06:10| I wanted to ask, when was that code updated to PC in that area of acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14770)|
| 4:06:16| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14776)|
| 4:06:20| I'd have to do a little research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14780)|
| 4:06:21| It looks like there were some amendments made in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| It would have been in 2019 because I would have recalled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14785)|
| 4:06:30| 1999, 96.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14790)|
| 4:06:33| The PC zone came out after we established the neighborhood commercial zone to take its place in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14793)|
| 4:06:45| Again, I don't have the history to confirm that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14805)|
| 4:06:53| When did the neighborhood commercial zone go into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14813)|
| 4:06:57| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14817)|
| 4:07:23| You can email me that if you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14843)|
| 4:07:25| I don't have it readily available right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14845)|
| 4:07:28| It looks like there were some amendments made in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14848)|
| 4:07:33| I don't know the exact date that it was introduced into the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14853)|
| 4:07:36| Mr. Merlin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14856)|
| 4:07:37| I looked at that when I started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14857)|
| 4:07:39| I believe the planned commercial was first adopted in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14859)|
| 4:07:43| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14863)|
| 4:07:46| You mean the neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14866)|
| 4:07:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14868)|
| 4:07:49| Yeah, neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14869)|
| 4:07:50| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14870)|
| 4:07:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14871)|
| 4:07:52| Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14872)|
| 4:07:54| Yes, it would be nice if I had time to go through and read every deed and search every property in the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14874)|
| 4:08:01| But I don't have that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| That's why we have paid staff to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14883)|
| 4:08:06| And, you know, maybe it is up to us whenever we get these sector plans to go through every piece of property and make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14886)|
| 4:08:15| But I'm counting on professionals with more knowledge than me in it to take care of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14895)|
| 4:08:20| But we have an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14900)|
| 4:08:23| We have a property rights issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14903)|
| 4:08:25| You have a neighborhoods concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14905)|
| 4:08:28| I get both of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14908)|
| 4:08:34| But I normally go with property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14914)|
| 4:08:36| This is my nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14916)|
| 4:08:40| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14920)|
| 4:08:43| Speaking to the property rights issue, we have someone that owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14923)|
| 4:08:51| We have someone that has said to the neighborhood, give us an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14931)|
| 4:08:58| If you want this property, then tell us something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14938)|
| 4:09:05| And I really see that as a stumbling block, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14945)|
| 4:09:11| If another entity cannot purchase the property, then that other entity, though, cannot tell a property owner, well, then, too bad, you can't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14951)|
| 4:09:25| Or, you know, you can't sell it unless you do X, Y, Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14965)|
| 4:09:29| I mean, if any of you sitting there owned that piece of property, if that were your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14969)|
| 4:09:39| and someone was trying to tell you that, I mean, you wouldn't be a happy camper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14979)|
| 4:09:47| Nobody would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14987)|
| 4:09:48| Nobody wants us telling us on our property that we own, that we have paid for, what we can and cannot do within reason on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=14988)|
| 4:10:00| Not one of you would want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15000)|
| 4:10:03| And we do kind of get into that issue, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15003)|
| 4:10:06| It is just a right that we have as a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15006)|
| 4:10:12| And it is disturbing to me that there was never one good-faith offer that ever, ever came out of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15012)|
| 4:10:21| May I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15021)|
| 4:10:23| Thank you for providing me that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15023)|
| 4:10:27| There are two points that you made, Commissioner Hill, that I want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15027)|
| 4:10:33| And first is the property rights issue you alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15033)|
| 4:10:38| So there are more than one property right at issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15038)|
| 4:10:44| It's not just Home Federal's property rights as the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15044)|
| 4:10:48| But I want to address the fact that the person that initiated an offer with us was not the landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15048)|
| 4:10:55| It was Holbrob, who wants to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15055)|
| 4:10:58| They are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15058)|
| 4:10:59| Holbrob isn't the applicant on the papers that were filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15059)|
| 4:11:02| It's Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15062)|
| 4:11:04| And even if that were the case, whether the community could find a number in the dark, having been offered a huge amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15064)|
| 4:11:13| being told, what's it worth to you, neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15073)|
| 4:11:17| What's it worth to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15077)|
| 4:11:18| It's worth $1.95 million to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15078)|
| 4:11:20| Can you get it together in six months and give us $50,000 up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15080)|
| 4:11:24| And, by the way, you have three days for that, three and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15084)|
| 4:11:28| So when we're looking at what is appropriate as far as zoning, when our neighborhood decided to take that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15088)|
| 4:11:35| and our neighborhood looked at, well, what is the legal requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15095)|
| 4:11:39| What's the criteria to zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| The criteria to rezone or amend the sector plan is all outlined in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15101)|
| 4:11:47| and referred to in the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15107)|
| 4:11:51| And it has to be a substantial change in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15111)|
| 4:11:54| It has to be a substantial change or, it says, a mistake or omission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15114)|
| 4:11:59| But the Planning Commission staff got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15119)|
| 4:12:02| The Planning Commission staff appropriately found what the sector plan is for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15122)|
| 4:12:08| by looking at what exists there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15128)|
| 4:12:10| Every property owner, Home Federal or even a potential property owner, Holrob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15130)|
| 4:12:14| every property owner makes investment risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15134)|
| 4:12:18| When I buy my house, I don't know if that property will be as marketable in the future as it is when I buy it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15138)|
| 4:12:24| And Home Federal made an investment risk when they purchased the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15144)|
| 4:12:29| and they made investment risks all along the way when they chose not to develop it at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15149)|
| 4:12:33| which would have been before the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15153)|
| 4:12:36| Now, I'm not blaming Home Federal, and I believe Home Federal should be made whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15156)|
| 4:12:40| And I think that that's fair and just, or at least be offered some fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15160)|
| 4:12:46| But asking the community to initiate an offer that is a counter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15166)|
| 4:12:52| or to counter an offer for $1.95 million to save our neighborhood from improper commercial encroachment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15172)|
| 4:13:00| well, that just doesn't abide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15180)|
| 4:13:02| It is impossible for us, even, as you said, 2,000 neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15182)|
| 4:13:06| Yes, maybe if everybody chipped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15186)|
| 4:13:09| But even if there was some chance to do that, and we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15189)|
| 4:13:17| We want to work with the county, and we've met with the mayor, and we've met with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15197)|
| 4:13:23| And so many of you were kind enough to take your time and come to the field to see it for yourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15203)|
| 4:13:28| even those of you who don't have any voters in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15208)|
| 4:13:33| And you took the time to see what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| And I think you see that it is a low-density residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15215)|
| 4:13:38| I don't think that's even being disputed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15218)|
| 4:13:40| So what we do have is a conflict between the sector plan and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15220)|
| 4:13:44| And there is a resolution, and there are options for Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15224)|
| 4:13:47| They could rezone the property to match the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15227)|
| 4:13:50| And I know that's not the issue before the commission today, but that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15230)|
| 4:13:53| Then it would be low-density residential, and there would be options to build and develop on that for Home Federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15233)|
| 4:14:01| the actual homeowner or landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15241)|
| 4:14:04| And that would be an appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15244)|
| 4:14:06| And perhaps doing that would allow the community to work with Home Federal and make them whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15246)|
| 4:14:12| and work with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15252)|
| 4:14:13| The county seems to support the idea of relieving this conflict in a way that's beneficial to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15253)|
| 4:14:22| And voting against the sector plan amendment now is not just popular with all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15262)|
| 4:14:27| It's right, it's just, and it's in line with the sector plan amendment requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15267)|
| 4:14:31| Denial is the only choice if looking at the legal criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15271)|
| 4:14:37| Whether we offer to buy it or not, that's not a criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15277)|
| 4:14:41| Whether there isn't even a possibility for the neighborhood to buy a plot of land that's literally inside a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15281)|
| 4:14:49| I'm not sure that's for the community to bear alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15289)|
| 4:14:52| But maybe it is, and maybe we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15292)|
| 4:14:55| But the question today is, what's the appropriate, has Home Federal satisfied the criteria to rezone and amend the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15295)|
| 4:15:03| And our position is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15303)|
| 4:15:04| And the offer and counteroffer, whether it was made in good faith at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15304)|
| 4:15:09| or whether the conditions were ever even something the community could surmount or devise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15309)|
| 4:15:15| you have to remember, too, we're operating in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15315)|
| 4:15:17| Home Federal, again, wasn't working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| It's Holrob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15319)|
| 4:15:20| I don't know what their investment in this property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15320)|
| 4:15:22| I don't know what lease agreements they might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15322)|
| 4:15:24| I don't know how to verify what their opportunity costs might be, which is what is built into the $1.95 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15324)|
| 4:15:30| Nobody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15330)|
| 4:15:31| We're operating in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15331)|
| 4:15:32| And for us to just close our eyes and point to a number, that seems unjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15332)|
| 4:15:36| And it's because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15336)|
| 4:15:38| The fact that we're opposed to this sector plan amendment isn't because we want to trample on the rights of Home Federal or punish them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15338)|
| 4:15:47| We want to do the right thing, and we want to make sure that this commission knows the facts and can do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15347)|
| 4:15:54| And, you know, if Mr. Mullins wants to know what it's worth to us, it's worth six months of advocating for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15354)|
| 4:16:01| It's worth six months of getting together and having meetings and coming up with emails and finding deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15361)|
| 4:16:06| and learning about deed restrictions and learning zoning rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15366)|
| 4:16:09| That's what it's worth to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15369)|
| 4:16:10| And we'll continue to do it for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15370)|
| 4:16:13| And you would want that for your neighborhoods, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15373)|
| 4:16:16| The sector plan is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15376)|
| 4:16:17| That is not what is in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15377)|
| 4:16:19| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15379)|
| 4:16:22| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15382)|
| 4:16:28| Was there ever a house that was bought in and around this neighborhood or any other neighborhoods in which this zoning was ever not commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15388)|
| 4:16:43| I believe the planned commercial predated most of the other lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15403)|
| 4:16:46| Commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15406)|
| 4:16:47| Oh, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15407)|
| 4:16:48| It started as commercial, then as planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15408)|
| 4:16:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15410)|
| 4:16:51| Has there ever been a property owner that has bought a home where this has not been a commercial lot for 40 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15411)|
| 4:16:56| I am under oath, and I can't say for 100 percent certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15416)|
| 4:16:58| But from my understanding, I don't believe any of the houses predated the zoning of the lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15418)|
| 4:17:06| Take whole Rob out of the equation for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15426)|
| 4:17:09| Let's say they said, you know what, we're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15429)|
| 4:17:12| We've got better projects down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15432)|
| 4:17:15| And what if Home Federal, the property owner with the property rights, said, you know what, it's worth $1.8 million to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15435)|
| 4:17:24| because that's what the market will bear these days, and I can put all kinds of stuff on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15444)|
| 4:17:30| Let's go ahead and build two branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15450)|
| 4:17:32| Let's build a Pep Boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15452)|
| 4:17:34| Let's sell it to Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15454)|
| 4:17:37| There's 100 things under what it's currently zoned at, and they said, you have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15457)|
| 4:17:42| You can buy it for $1.8 million, or we're going to go sell it to Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15462)|
| 4:17:46| Where would we be in the same argument?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15466)|
| 4:17:49| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15471)|
| 4:17:52| So the only acceptable use from the neighborhood is to leave it a field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15472)|
| 4:17:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15478)|
| 4:17:59| No, that's not the only acceptable use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15479)|
| 4:18:01| There are other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15481)|
| 4:18:02| Perhaps there are uses within the planned commercial space where it's currently zoned as that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15482)|
| 4:18:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15489)|
| 4:18:11| A low-density residential would fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15491)|
| 4:18:14| There might be opportunities for duplexes or small garden apartments that would be appropriate there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15494)|
| 4:18:19| and would be in line with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15499)|
| 4:18:21| What if Home Federal doesn't want to do any of those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15501)|
| 4:18:23| Well, I understand that that's Home Federal's decision, and Home Federal might take an investment loss as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15503)|
| 4:18:29| See, I think we have Home Federal and Hull Rob in the neighborhood, and this is so personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15509)|
| 4:18:37| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15517)|
| 4:18:38| We all get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15518)|
| 4:18:39| But we're forgetting that our decisions are based upon legally defensible decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15519)|
| 4:18:47| and we can deny something or approve something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15527)|
| 4:18:51| Then they can – the actual landowner who has the rights can then go to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15531)|
| 4:18:57| and even if they make the same decision in one favor or the other, then they take it to Chancery Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15537)|
| 4:19:03| and Chancery Court says, was there a legally defensible reason to deny XYZ based upon the rights that exist to today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15543)|
| 4:19:12| And we're right back in the same position, likely with the same decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15552)|
| 4:19:17| I don't know if I can agree with you on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15557)|
| 4:19:19| I think that your decision today to be upheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15559)|
| 4:19:23| it has to be defensible in the sense that it's not arbitrary or capricious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15563)|
| 4:19:28| and following the criteria of the Zoning and Sector Plan Amendment requirements would be anything but arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15568)|
| 4:19:35| Continuing to follow the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan would not be arbitrary or capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15575)|
| 4:19:41| This is a problem for Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15581)|
| 4:19:43| I agree, and it is a problem that other landowners and homeowners have faced, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15583)|
| 4:19:51| And the conflict is, who bears the cost of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15591)|
| 4:19:54| Well, who bears the cost of any investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15594)|
| 4:19:56| And it's the investor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15596)|
| 4:19:58| But at the end of the day, the way the property is situated, there is absolutely no buffer between the property and eight houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15598)|
| 4:20:07| who will be completely, directly, adversely impacted by that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15607)|
| 4:20:11| which is what the sector plan and the rezoning requirements don't allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15611)|
| 4:20:15| So when the deeds came out for those lots, I can tell you this, that you would get a variation of answers from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15615)|
| 4:20:24| Some people who bought their houses, in fact, the Wilsons, who are one of the first people, and they're here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15624)|
| 4:20:28| they bought their house, and they were told by Mr. Leeds, the developer for Century Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15628)|
| 4:20:33| that it was, yes, that front lot was going to be those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15633)|
| 4:20:38| I'm going to just stop because we can't make decisions based on three or four conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15638)|
| 4:20:44| Well, no, but all that to say, Commissioner Jay, is that when the deed was made or when the zoning became commercial of any type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15644)|
| 4:20:54| there were no homes that failed to have a buffer between them and the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15654)|
| 4:20:59| The deeds and the way it worked out, it was meant that the developer would absorb any of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15659)|
| 4:21:06| The developer didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15666)|
| 4:21:07| He built the houses instead, and the property remained commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15667)|
| 4:21:10| And so it's just simply not compatible now with what we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15670)|
| 4:21:15| Commissioner Lundy, and then I'll come to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15675)|
| 4:21:18| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15678)|
| 4:21:20| First of all, as a former president of a neighborhood association, I want to say thank you to Betts Hill Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15680)|
| 4:21:27| This is amazing to have so many community members here, and I just want to know your voice does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15687)|
| 4:21:34| I think sometimes we forget that you are homeowners, so you are investors in that land also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15694)|
| 4:21:41| and it seems like that always gets inured when it's time to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15701)|
| 4:21:45| So I just want to say that I hear you and I understand that you are part of this investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15705)|
| 4:21:50| I'm trying to figure out because, and I could be wrong, so correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15710)|
| 4:22:00| I feel like the neighborhood is kind of getting blamed for not doing an offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15720)|
| 4:22:06| and I'm trying to figure out how, and someone need to educate me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15726)|
| 4:22:09| How can they legally do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15729)|
| 4:22:11| Who's the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15731)|
| 4:22:12| What corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15732)|
| 4:22:13| Is it LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15733)|
| 4:22:14| I don't know how that happens for the neighborhood to be able to buy a property, so I need help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15734)|
| 4:22:22| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15742)|
| 4:22:23| We asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15743)|
| 4:22:24| One of the things that was conveyed in the first offer is that they had to have some legally recognized corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15744)|
| 4:22:30| or something that could actually invest and purchase property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15750)|
| 4:22:35| and there was a response from the neighborhood to say we do have an HOA, and that should be legally sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15755)|
| 4:22:42| But if you look back at the, I think it's in the e-mails I provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15762)|
| 4:22:45| Actually, in addition to that, I reached out as a board member of the Legacy Parks Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15765)|
| 4:22:50| which can legally buy, accept, or broker land on behalf of other parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15770)|
| 4:22:55| and asked if they would consider partnering in this regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15775)|
| 4:22:59| and they said if they needed to have a fiscal agent to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15779)|
| 4:23:04| they could play an intermediary part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15784)|
| 4:23:06| It never got to that point, but we did have a nonprofit that is recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15786)|
| 4:23:10| as somebody who could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15790)|
| 4:23:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15792)|
| 4:23:13| So is there a reason, Annie, you're making that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15793)|
| 4:23:17| Is that an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15797)|
| 4:23:18| Like, was you interested in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15798)|
| 4:23:20| Did you feel comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15800)|
| 4:23:23| So one of the things we did, and I know Commissioner Jay is on the Board of Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15803)|
| 4:23:29| and that would be a wonderful way to raise funds and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15809)|
| 4:23:33| Our HOA is a voluntary HOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15813)|
| 4:23:35| and I believe it was after we rejected the initial offer that Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15815)|
| 4:23:40| and you can review the e-mails, that Mr. Mullins requested that we form a formal entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15820)|
| 4:23:45| And we declined to do that because we decided that we just didn't have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15825)|
| 4:23:50| to come up with any number that we could within the short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15830)|
| 4:23:54| So what I can say is that, you know, is it an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15834)|
| 4:23:57| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15837)|
| 4:23:58| I hope one day that is an option for us, that we can build off of Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15838)|
| 4:24:02| I know Legacy Parks won't work directly with us at this time because we don't own the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15842)|
| 4:24:07| and land acquisition is kind of a different animal than fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15847)|
| 4:24:12| We would love to help fundraise money for the purchase of the field, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15852)|
| 4:24:17| And I don't know what legal requirement that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15857)|
| 4:24:21| and whether if we didn't raise the money, the money could be borrowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15861)|
| 4:24:25| And we had a short time frame that was relayed to us in the offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15865)|
| 4:24:28| not just to accept the offer or decline, but the terms of the offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15868)|
| 4:24:32| Frankly, I've never raised $1.95 million or tried, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15872)|
| 4:24:36| Maybe that's easy to hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15876)|
| 4:24:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15877)|
| 4:24:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15878)|
| 4:24:39| It's really according to who's in your circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15879)|
| 4:24:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15881)|
| 4:24:42| And some people got better circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15882)|
| 4:24:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15884)|
| 4:24:45| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15885)|
| 4:24:47| So you can understand where it would be hard for just Bexhill HOA to do that when there are 13 neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15887)|
| 4:24:55| It seems a daunting task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15895)|
| 4:24:57| And so that was, you know, we're working under time constraints in what we know and what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15897)|
| 4:25:02| and we certainly want to be part of a solution, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15902)|
| 4:25:06| I guess it seems to me, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15906)|
| 4:25:08| I understand property is rife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15908)|
| 4:25:10| It's my land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15910)|
| 4:25:11| I want to do what I want with my land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15911)|
| 4:25:12| but how do we find the balance of respecting a neighborhood and being a good partner with the land owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15912)|
| 4:25:21| I mean, I'll just go ahead and say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15921)|
| 4:25:22| I'm agreeing with planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15922)|
| 4:25:25| I will vote no on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15925)|
| 4:25:27| But, you know, we talk about that we need houses, like, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15927)|
| 4:25:34| why can't the land owner just build some homes on it and make everybody happy, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15934)|
| 4:25:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15938)|
| 4:25:39| Because we keep complaining that we need houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15939)|
| 4:25:41| So I guess the former ‑‑ I guess we voted earlier today on another piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15941)|
| 4:25:53| I think we denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15953)|
| 4:25:54| I don't remember so much going on, but people are arguing that we need housing more than commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15954)|
| 4:26:00| You have North Shore to go hang out and drink and eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15960)|
| 4:26:03| But that's my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15963)|
| 4:26:10| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15970)|
| 4:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15971)|
| 4:26:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15972)|
| 4:26:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15975)|
| 4:26:18| I want everybody to be real honest with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15978)|
| 4:26:20| Everybody in the crowd, everybody on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15980)|
| 4:26:24| How many people realize this property has always been zoned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15984)|
| 4:26:30| It has, has it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15990)|
| 4:26:37| Since 1972 it's been zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=15997)|
| 4:26:50| Unless you're going to call people up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16010)|
| 4:26:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16013)|
| 4:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16014)|
| 4:26:55| As to the investment aspect of this, what if there was an error in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16015)|
| 4:27:05| and your house somehow wound up in a sector plan for agriculture or open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16025)|
| 4:27:12| When you went to sell it, would you want the government telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16032)|
| 4:27:18| you can't sell it to somebody to use for a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16038)|
| 4:27:22| That's kind of the same thing that's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16042)|
| 4:27:24| It's really strange how this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16044)|
| 4:27:27| And what I'm thinking is where we're at right now is if the sector plan had been allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16047)|
| 4:27:34| as it should have been, to match the zoning on the property, nobody would be here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16054)|
| 4:27:40| Everybody would be at MPC for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16060)|
| 4:27:45| Is that not correct, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16065)|
| 4:27:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16068)|
| 4:27:52| Did your MPC staff, not MPC commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16072)|
| 4:27:57| did the staff ever recognize that there was an error in the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16077)|
| 4:28:04| Yes, the staff did recognize there's an error in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16084)|
| 4:28:08| Did they change their recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16088)|
| 4:28:13| For this particular case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16093)|
| 4:28:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16095)|
| 4:28:16| No, the recommendation that staff presented was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16096)|
| 4:28:21| Even though they recognized there was an error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16101)|
| 4:28:23| Yeah, the question is, is it an error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16103)|
| 4:28:28| Or an omission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16108)|
| 4:28:30| Or omission, or in terms of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16110)|
| 4:28:36| It doesn't necessarily mean that the error gets corrected with a commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16116)|
| 4:28:39| It can be corrected in another way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16119)|
| 4:28:41| But that's the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16121)|
| 4:28:43| It can be corrected by designating LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16123)|
| 4:28:47| or it can be corrected through the processes before you that's been recommended by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16127)|
| 4:28:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16133)|
| 4:28:58| I'm not seeing any further lights on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16138)|
| 4:29:00| I think it's back to you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16140)|
| 4:29:03| It's the district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16143)|
| 4:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16145)|
| 4:29:07| Thank you for everybody for showing up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16147)|
| 4:29:08| Thank you for all the emails and the phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16148)|
| 4:29:10| Thank you for the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16150)|
| 4:29:15| Since I've lived here, I've actually lived down the street for the first nine years, ten years I've been here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16155)|
| 4:29:21| I just recently moved a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16161)|
| 4:29:23| So I've seen this property every day for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16163)|
| 4:29:28| I would love to see it be a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16168)|
| 4:29:30| I think it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16170)|
| 4:29:32| I know the community uses it now as a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16172)|
| 4:29:35| First and foremost, land rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16175)|
| 4:29:39| And I can't deny somebody else's rights because of somebody else's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16179)|
| 4:29:46| So I'm going to make the motion to approve per Planning Commission's recommendation to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16186)|
| 4:30:02| So the motion on 59 is to approve per Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16202)|
| 4:30:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16208)|
| 4:30:09| The next used neighborhood center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16209)|
| 4:30:11| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16211)|
| 4:30:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16215)|
| 4:30:18| Okay, the motion on the floor is to approve item number 59, per Planning by Commissioner Ward, seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16218)|
| 4:30:26| Is there additional discussion from our commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16226)|
| 4:30:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16231)|
| 4:30:32| I'm going to go ahead and preemptively call a roll call vote on this, because I have a feeling it will be needed anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16232)|
| 4:30:38| Madam Clerk, would you conduct a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16238)|

| 4:32:44| I'm happy to, we've talked this pretty thoroughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16364)|
| 4:32:47| but I'm happy to give each side five more minutes if each side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16367)|
| 4:32:50| would like it, if the commissioners would like to continue to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16370)|
| 4:32:53| further discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16373)|
| 4:32:55| I'm looking around for some guidance from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16375)|
| 4:33:00| If the applicant and the people are here, they should speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16380)|
| 4:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16383)|
| 4:33:04| Mr. Mullins, I'll start with you, and I'll put five minutes up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16384)|
| 4:33:07| the board, and then I'll go to the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16387)|
| 4:33:11| and we'll answer any further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16391)|
| 4:33:13| Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16393)|
| 4:33:15| Thank you, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16395)|
| 4:33:17| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16397)|
| 4:33:18| I do think we have tried to cover as much of this as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16398)|
| 4:33:22| In the previous discussion, like I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16402)|
| 4:33:24| it's sometimes hard to divorce these two issues from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16404)|
| 4:33:31| Just like before the full Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16411)|
| 4:33:34| the issue with the incongruent sector plan with the legacy planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16414)|
| 4:33:40| commercial zoning caused a lot of debate on kind of the chicken and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16420)|
| 4:33:45| the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16425)|
| 4:33:46| Where was the error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16426)|
| 4:33:47| What effect does this have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16427)|
| 4:33:49| And after the Planning Commission wrestled with that issue and voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16429)|
| 4:33:53| nine to five to approve the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16433)|
| 4:33:57| they approved the rezoning unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16437)|
| 4:34:01| And I think the reason for that is the changes of condition that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16441)|
| 4:34:08| to warrant a rezoning, you know, they all have to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16448)|
| 4:34:14| And they found that the only thing that was inconsistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16454)|
| 4:34:18| conditions of the rezoning was that the rezoning did not comply with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16458)|
| 4:34:22| sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16462)|
| 4:34:23| So once they were able to take that issue and decide it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16463)|
| 4:34:26| they followed along with what the rezoning asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16466)|
| 4:34:32| Ms. Brooks touched on it here tonight, and staff touched on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16472)|
| 4:34:35| The neighborhood commercial zone, which I went back and looked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16475)|
| 4:34:39| here it looks like the first ordinance for it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16479)|
| 4:34:42| it looks like maybe 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16482)|
| 4:34:45| I might be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16485)|
| 4:34:47| You know, it wasn't available then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16487)|
| 4:34:49| but it does have more robust landscaping and screening requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16489)|
| 4:34:55| because it is intended to serve a neighborhood like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16495)|
| 4:35:00| It is intended to be placed on a piece of property like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16500)|
| 4:35:06| And, you know, there might not have been a demand that grew as quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16506)|
| 4:35:11| as when Bexhill was first developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16511)|
| 4:35:15| But that demand is catching up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16515)|
| 4:35:18| And, yes, there is a need for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16518)|
| 4:35:20| There's also a need for commercial development to serve the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16520)|
| 4:35:26| And I can tell you that Holrob has had no problems finding local companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16526)|
| 4:35:33| that are willing to invest in this property should this rezoning go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16533)|
| 4:35:37| So there is certainly a market for that to justify this commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16537)|
| 4:35:42| So, you know, I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16542)|
| 4:35:45| I'd be glad to go through the arguments more, but it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16545)|
| 4:35:49| I think we've talked about this enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16549)|
| 4:35:52| I don't want to shortchange anything, and I'm here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16552)|
| 4:35:55| But I would ask that you follow staff's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16555)|
| 4:35:58| unanimous recommendation, and approve the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16558)|
| 4:36:01| It's a neighborhood commercial because it's a more appropriate zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16561)|
| 4:36:04| for this piece of property next to this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16564)|
| 4:36:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16567)|
| 4:36:08| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16568)|
| 4:36:09| Ms. Svolto, I'll reset the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16569)|
| 4:36:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16575)|
| 4:36:16| I'll likewise be as brief as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16576)|
| 4:36:18| And I will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16578)|
| 4:36:20| I'm Ann Marie Svolto, 1532 Bexhill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16580)|
| 4:36:24| There are four criteria that the applicant, home federal is the applicant, must meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16584)|
| 4:36:30| One is that it shall be necessary because of substantially changed circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16590)|
| 4:36:35| Those don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16595)|
| 4:36:36| We have the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16596)|
| 4:36:37| Everything continues to be residential and has for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16597)|
| 4:36:41| The proposed amendment shall be consistent with the intent and purposes of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16601)|
| 4:36:44| The zoning resolution and ordinances exist to regulate zoning on properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16604)|
| 4:36:50| and create a balancing act that we've discussed already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16610)|
| 4:36:54| and I won't go into detail about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16614)|
| 4:36:57| The other criteria are that the amendment shall not adversely affect any part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16617)|
| 4:37:03| nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16623)|
| 4:37:08| I think you can all imagine the adverse effects commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16628)|
| 4:37:12| as the kind proposed here by Holrob, would have on this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16632)|
| 4:37:15| the noise pollution, odor, the increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16635)|
| 4:37:19| By the way, the concept plan shows that the entrance to the concept development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16639)|
| 4:37:25| is directly in our neighborhood with no other option for us to leave our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16645)|
| 4:37:28| So we are trapped by the strip mall that's proposed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16648)|
| 4:37:31| By the way, I think this is important to note, Holrob, the investor here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16651)|
| 4:37:37| within five miles of 1401 Bexhill, there are 50, over 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16657)|
| 4:37:43| vacant or for-lease properties owned by Holrob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16663)|
| 4:37:46| Within 10 miles, there are 130 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16666)|
| 4:37:49| So they might have some leasing agreements now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16669)|
| 4:37:52| but there is no telling what will go in there when those leasing agreements don't get filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16672)|
| 4:37:56| So there is a great risk to impact adversely this entire corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16676)|
| 4:38:02| And so we ask that you consider that and deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16682)|
| 4:38:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16687)|
| 4:38:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16688)|
| 4:38:09| Is there discussion from commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16689)|
| 4:38:14| Seeing none, I'll look to the 4th District Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16694)|
| 4:38:16| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16696)|
| 4:38:19| Motion to approve for recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16699)|
| 4:38:22| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16702)|
| 4:38:30| Motion to approve for recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16710)|
| 4:38:34| Commissioner Ward, approved for recommendation is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16714)|
| 4:38:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16718)|
| 4:38:43| Is there additional discussion from our commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16723)|
| 4:38:47| I'll do a roll call, ask for a roll call vote on this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16727)|
| 4:38:51| The motion is to approve with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16731)|
| 4:38:55| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16735)|
| 4:38:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16737)|
| 4:38:58| Commissioner Durrett votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16738)|
| 4:38:59| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16739)|
| 4:39:01| I have direct evidence that this is retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16741)|
| 4:39:06| We're in the middle of a vote, ma'am. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210726-combined?start=16746)|
