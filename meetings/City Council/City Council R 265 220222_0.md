| 0:03:34| I'll go ahead and give a share of my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| First, I want to give everyone an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| We just received on the search for our next police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| You might recall that the application deadline was Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| February 20th, and all applications are being reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| right now and sorted by the Police Executive Research Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| the firm that we've hired to help us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| But here's what they shared with us already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| There are 39 total applicants from 23 different states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Eight applicants are from Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| There are some internal applicants, and the pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| of applicants is diverse regarding race and gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| And this status update has been shared to the media and will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| on our website for the search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| which is knoxviltn.gov slash chief search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| I also wanted to update you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| on the compensation announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| Last Friday, I announced, and several were able to join me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| my proposal to revamp the city's compensation plan in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| to address staffing and recruitment challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| that have strained critical city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| The plan is designed to help secure core services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| that residents rely on, like police response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| fire protection, and brush collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Key to this discussion are the preliminary findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| from a comprehensive classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| and compensation study that shows city salaries lag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| on average, 10% behind the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| Ten percent behind the market is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| So I want to thank council for your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| to this critical gap, for approving the compensation study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| without which we wouldn't have this data, and to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| that I'm looking forward to sharing more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| about the findings and recommendations of that study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| at your March 3rd workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| Our team will be publicly sharing a full report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| from the study on Monday, February 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| so that you, as well as our employees and members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| of the public, can see the full results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| So that will be provided Monday, February 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| and then the workshop is March 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Hopefully you already have those dates on your calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| So it is 2-22-2022, and today was the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| that the Sun Sphere was reopened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| to the public in nearly two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| So I was able to get a sneak peek last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| and they've done a marvelous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| It looks really great, and it's really worth seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=355)|

| 0:06:02| and all of the proceeds will be going to the Sun Sphere Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| which helps preserve this local landmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| And as of the first day, I just got an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=368)|

| 0:16:58| on utilizing TIF and pilot revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| to help finance the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| So that has been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| as part of the financing plan for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| And so where does the figure of 46,750 come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| So you mean the total amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| We're talking about the 14 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| in public infrastructure costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| for the city streets, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| No, it says on page 248 of the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| At the bottom that the estimated cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| of the public infrastructure project is 15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| and the estimated cost of the mixed use project is 46,750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| That's the developer's estimate on how much revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| I need to look at the page you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| I'm sorry, Council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Yeah, I was trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| What page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| It's a packet page 248.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| And I was-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| Oh yes, Council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| That is the investment that will be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| in the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| So for this agreement, we're given on page 252 and 253| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| a listing of what the base taxes are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| And those are the taxes that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| and the county will continue to receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| And then the TIF payments will be any taxes that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| in on those parcels above that base tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| One of my concerns is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| and I've raised this as a concern before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| but we just don't have much information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| about the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| When I was looking into this issue about TIF financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| it said, really, we need the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| for that private development to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| there's a contractional requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| that a certain amount is invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| into that private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| that we have some sort of insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| and performance bonds in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| in case the place catches on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| You know, without a development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| we are authorizing eight million, up to eight million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| in financing for a private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| that we just don't have the information about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| So there will be a development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Councilman Parker, we can't negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| a development agreement when there is no provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| to allow for this increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| So this is the first step to authorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| as part of this redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Once we have that ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| we can negotiate a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| that includes that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| For me, the order of things is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| We also haven't had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| to have a conversation about a but-for test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| and whether this private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| meets that but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| I'll just remind my colleagues that our first workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| on the redevelopment of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| promises were made that development would move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| regardless of our decisions about the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| And so I don't see how it passes the but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| If this is approved and the four to eight million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| goes towards paying the development cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| of this private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| where does the initial money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| I just want to clarify for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| that this is an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| to the Magnolia Avenue Redevelopment Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| that authorizes the use of TIF financing as a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| It does not obligate us to utilize that tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| We are not obligating anything to the private developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| in this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| We are providing that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| that would then have to be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| by a development agreement, which would obligate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| This is just providing a revenue source for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| in the Magnolia Avenue District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Does not obligate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| So if four to eight million goes towards paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| the development cost of the private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| where would that initial money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| It says for the public infrastructure project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| this agreement outlines that the city's capital funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| will pay initially for the public infrastructure project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| but it doesn't identify where the funds would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| to cover the four to eight million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| for the mixed use project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| Having a hard time following here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| This is the private development that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Yes, this item before us outlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| that the 15 million for public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| will be paid from city capital funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| but it doesn't identify where the four to eight million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| for this private development will come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| So it comes from the private sector, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| So this basically enables the developer to borrow funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| against future revenue that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| in the form of tax increments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| So it's, this is not money that we're borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| This is, that is private money that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| According to this redevelopment agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| or redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| it says that the mixed use project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| four to eight million is expected to be paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| with the proceeds of the tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| So the developer borrows money to pay for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| And one of the revenue sources to repay those loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| is tax increment, is part of the increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| So we're basically what we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| and I just want to review this for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| is that when we build the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| one of the revenue sources for the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| we're borrowing money to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| the sports authority is borrowing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| to build the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| And one of the revenue sources for repaying that debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| is new tax increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| The private developer is also borrowing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| to build the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Now we would not get new tax increments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| if that private development is not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| The dollars that the private developer is borrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| will also be repaid through half of that tax increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| So we're basically splitting the new revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| that new tax increment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| the developer is able to use, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| that source of revenue to repay the loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| that they're borrowing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Ms. Parker, another council member has a question also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| so maybe ask one more and then we'll go to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| There's also a time period on this redevelopment plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| creates a little risk for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| for the taxpayers at least of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| that requires this debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| essentially to be dealt with in 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| There's a maximum maturity of 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| Do we have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| projections currently regarding this tax area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| and the extension that has been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| that this extension will be adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| to capture enough taxes to pay off that debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| in the time period allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Yeah, that part of what we did in the analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| of creating the TIF district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| is to understand a reasonable district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| in which this could be paid off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| in a reasonable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| I mean, it's estimates, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| because we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| we can't force private development on those parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| but based on experience of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| who were looking at this and KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Ben Bentley is here, executive director of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| We are really fortunate to have a good partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| who understands redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| and the potential opportunity that is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| through creating districts like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| So that was part of the analysis, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| I'm gonna recognize Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| You have some questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Deputy Welch, my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| is that a TIF district would be any private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| that took place in a TIF district we would benefit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| So whether it is this one or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| all we're doing is increasing the land mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| from which we will benefit from getting TIF financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1646)|
| 0:27:26| And just to add, as a person who lent money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| for private development back downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| when it was just starting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| the private sector financial institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| do rely on TIF increment financing to pay back the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| that the private developer is assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| When the private developer borrows money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| they also sign a personal guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| I don't think we talk about that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| The personal guarantee is not just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| if this doesn't work, you lose this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| It means the bank goes after everything you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| up to and including your home, all your bank accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| and everything to get paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| So when the bank makes a loan to a private developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| it has to take collateral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| because we're loaning the money in your checking account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| and you want it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| So I just wanted to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| because I think sometimes we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| the developers don't have any skin in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Yeah, Deputy Welch, could I get some clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| So it's blurry in the packet, the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| I think that's important to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| So in our packet on page 250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| it has the map of what the extended boundary is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| for the existing TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| So it looks like this extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| is only basically looping in an additional block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| And I'm just trying to read, it's Bertrand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| So it's moving from Linden over to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| is that Michaela, Michaela?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| So there, yes, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| So that extension is actually an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| of the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| There's some commercial property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1772)|
| 0:29:32| It's, and my glasses are not very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| Oh, so that's the entire warehouse district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| So you've got a purple lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| That's the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1784)|
| 0:29:44| And then there's an additional commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| that is encompassed by red dotted lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| and that's expanding the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| And then, and the amendment is enabling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| the use of tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| anywhere in the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| So anywhere within the redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| tax increment financing would be able to be utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| And then you have a blue dotted line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| On page two 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Yep, there's a blue dotted line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| And within that zone, that is a TIF district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| which means any redevelopment that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| within that blue dotted line area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| the new increment, both city and county increment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| will be utilized to pay for the city infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| that supports the multi-use stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| So the $14 million that we voted on at the last council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| So the boundaries of the blue line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| the dotted blue line on page two 51 are not changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| or they are, that's a new, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| that's a new TIF district that is now within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| The blue line is what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| You are voting on the entire amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| which includes all of the things that I described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Includes the blue dotted line area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| and the red extending the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| All right, thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Nope, that's, thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| did you have a question or comment or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| No, I think we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Okay, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Yes, Ms. Welch, I heard you say that the action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| that we might take tonight wouldn't obligate us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| to proceed with the TIF, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| This is basically the amendment to the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| creates a new toolbox for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| And we have a specific use for that toolbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| but we won't be able to use the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| until we have a development agreement in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| or really any TIF project in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| but specifically related to the private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| that's part of the multi-use stadium site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| We don't have a development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| We would, that would be our next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Right, and could you explain what kind of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| whether it be by the city or third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| otherwise that would take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| before the final agreement took place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Okay, so the private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| that's directly associated with the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| has been part of our financing plan from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| So that review process has been part of our public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| We've talked about this with those specific developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| that are part of that stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Any other TIF project that is associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| with a private development, anywhere in this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| would go through our third party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| KCDC and the city IDB supports that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| And it's an extensive review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| of the financial feasibility of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| the return on investment to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| that it's in an appropriate range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| And then that comes to council for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| before going back to the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| You answered my question very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Thank you, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| So Deputy Welch, just point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| Existing businesses, commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| that will now encompass this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| as the boundary is expanded, if we approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| they also will have the same opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| to apply for TIF funding as well for a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| and it would go through the third party review process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Correct for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Yes, if this amendment is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| then properties within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| the Magnolia Avenue Redevelopment District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| would be able to apply for a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| if that makes sense for their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| Those projects that are within the blue dotted line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| the tax increment from those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| is intended to be applied to the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| that $14 million of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| that we've been discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| And that's part of the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| we've decided to make that district small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| is that we want to give as many property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| in the district the opportunity to use that tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| for their own development project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| But these properties that are really close to the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| they're benefiting from the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| that the stadium provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| in a way that properties that are a little bit further out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| are not as directly benefiting from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| It does, and I also want to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| that I've gotten very positive feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| with the expansion of this TIF district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| from some of those business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| who would not have been able to have that opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| but for this expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| So due to that, I am going to be in favor of it, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| Yeah, early in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| we were definitely told about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| this KCDC redevelopment plan going towards stadium costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| but we were also given the heads up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| that the private development may be requesting a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| Is the private development still seeking a pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| So whether, the short answer to that question is yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| that what we've presented to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| over the course of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| is that there would be tax increment utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| to help fund the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| That would come from private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| When a private development includes home ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| or condominium ownership, that is a TIF project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| If it is a rental, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| a multifamily rental with retail, that's a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| It's essentially, it's increment that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| It's just a different form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| So yes, Council Member Parker, TIF pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| there will be one of each directly related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| to the private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| supporting the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| So just to clarify, that means that whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| I mean, it's, oh goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| whatever private developer would request a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| will not be paying taxes that would go towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| this financing structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| because their taxes will be frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| whereas the folks under the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| theirs will be rising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| but that money will go into a pot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| But the folks that get a pilot, that's just frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| So, yeah, I mean, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| I think I would love to have a further conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| with Council about sort of how these pilots and TIFs work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| I mean, within the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| just as we have another TIF district in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| and we, by and large, there are no pilots that are awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| or we don't enter into pilot development agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| in those districts, and that within that blue line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| we're counting on that TIF to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| the public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| So no pilots will be granted within the blue line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| It's very unlikely, it's very unlikely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| because the intention of that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| is to support public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2270)|
| 0:38:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Seeing no further questions or comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2285)|

| 0:38:13| to enter into an agreement with Seed Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2293)|

| 0:38:18| and implementation of violence interruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| street outreach programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2301)|

| 0:38:32| Mr. Stacey, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| we have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| Good evening, Mayor Kincaid, and good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| I think you're gonna have to lean over and speak, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Good evening, Mayor Kincaid, and good evening city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| So I'm here to talk about a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| A start to educate, unite, build, and heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Most people think of ending violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| looks like lean on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| If y'all know about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| took the young boy to the roof, told him to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Can you get a little closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Just, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| All right, so most people think ending violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| looks like lean on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| where he took the young boy to the roof, told him to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Boy didn't jump, came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| That's not the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| So the truth is this is the first step on a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| to healing our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| And this road needs the investment of local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| community leadership, and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| to show the community that the healing is possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| and support and let them know that that support is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| from our house to our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| So we just need to bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| We need to build these bridges to show that we are united| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| to help unite these communities and these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| and heal them to bring them away from this violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| Now, thank you so much for having me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you, Mr. Stacey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| I just wanna say that SEED has a reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| of being committed and being stable as far as outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| as far as working with young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| especially our young men of color in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| So I was very pleased to see this agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| So we already have a group that is established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| and connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| And I absolutely think that this is a step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| in the right direction so we can see some movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| and start seeing some healing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| and some aggressive prevention measures put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Thank you, Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| I appreciate this proposal coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| I do have some concerns that I have already expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| to several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| But we have a lot of groups engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| in violence intervention and prevention work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| And I think it's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| that the city play a larger role as the convener| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| so that groups are not put in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| where they're having to really compete for crumbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| As I look at the numbers in front of us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| for both this work and this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| and the next agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| the total of which is barely over $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| It leaves me wondering why are we not investing more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Why are we not getting more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| into the hands of more groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| And I understand this is a planning grant, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| I know that SEED is well-respected in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| and they have my respect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| And so as they move forward to pursue this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| I just send out the challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| that you be as inclusive as possible in your outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| and that you push back on the city when you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| to make sure that people are in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| that need to be regardless of their relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| with our city leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| That's the challenge I have for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| that you are gonna be the ones to help unite us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| in this work so that we can truly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| as a community, end the violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| So I appreciate y'all, y'all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you, that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| I did just wanna recognize Ms. LaKenya Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| for all your work on this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| And I know there's more to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| so really appreciate this concerted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| and conscientious effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| I have seen SEED's work and I've got a lot of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| in what they do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| My hope is that this pilot, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| or planning process will succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| and that after we have a chance to see how well it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| and I hope it does, that it can be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| into other parts of the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| I understand the issues a lot in East Knoxville, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| and there is a disproportionate need for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| let's say, in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| But to reiterate, my hope is that you succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| and form a plan that's workable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| and that we can use possibly as a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| in other parts of the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Seeing no further questions, all those in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2659)|

| 0:44:54| Can we get an update on the Violence Interruption Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| and how much money is available in that fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| We shared some of that at the budget retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| but we can send it by email later this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| more details, but I don't have it at my fingertips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| I did send an email to finance asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| that we have those numbers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2716)|

| 0:46:17| I just wanted to lift up the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| that I wanted to bring this resolution forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| and I appreciate my colleagues who joined me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| in bringing this forward to not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| call on our state legislators to pass a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| recognizing and implementing strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| to recognize gun violence as a public health emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| but I also wanted as a community for us to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| to have these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| and to recognize how gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| is impacting our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| And when I sat down to write the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2819)|
| 0:47:07| what initially brought it to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| was an article in Knoxville News Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| about a collective of black pastors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| in the state of Tennessee who were calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| for a bill that has been introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| by representative Lamar to be introduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| to be passed by the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| calling for gun violence to be viewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| as a public health emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| And then subsequently learned of representative McKenzie's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| own introduction of a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| And so I saw that there was energy and movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| at the state legislature and obviously support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| for this issue in Knoxville by our own state delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I began reaching out to community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| community groups to discuss the bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| that have been introduced and heard a lot of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| in the community for what is being deliberated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| at a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| The community wants to see gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| treated as a public health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| They want to see strategies implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| that will help our communities heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| The community wants, well, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| I got a lot of good feedback at the most recent park meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| and there were concerns raised by community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| as well as park board members themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| about how their neighborhoods are being targeted by police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| and how many times they themselves have been pulled over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| by police when they were doing nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| And so one thing that I hope to bring attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| with this resolution is also the need for us as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| to recommit to re-imagining policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| to hear from members of our community when they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| that the way police are targeting hotspots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| is traumatizing to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| it's harmful to our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| and it's not the most effective strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| And so I want not only for the state to make this commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| and to invest in more data reporting and funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| that our health department under the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| but still our health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| can then also start working on gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| There's an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| I have spoken with some folks at the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| and they said they simply just don't have funding currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| to work on gun violence issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| but they can share some reports with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| to let you know that it's on their radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| They just don't have the funding to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| So we're not creating anything new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| We're asking for more funding to do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| of what has been found to be most effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| with addressing gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| And I hope that my colleagues will join me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| in calling on the state to pass legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| that will do such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| but also committing to helping find solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| here in Knoxville that we can implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| that will help us reduce the gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| in a way that doesn't re-traumatize our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Yes, I would like to be added as a sponsor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3049)|
| 0:50:49| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| I wanna again just thank Council Member Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| for bringing this resolution forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| I also wanna challenge my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| to please reach out to your representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| in the state as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| because if you look at this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| these numbers are staggering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| not just across the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| not just in our city, but across our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| These things are happening everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| We have representatives here from Moms Demand Action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| We appreciate you being here and your advocacy as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| but everyone at the state level does not see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| as a public health crisis to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| that they are willing to provide funding to cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| to be able to help reduce the gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| to put some things in place that will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| from a mental health perspective as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| And so I think it's incumbent upon all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| if we are passionate and if we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| that this is the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| that we are advocating not just through this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| but every opportunity that we have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| And I feel like the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| we are moving in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| but we need more funding to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| So again, I want to compliment Council Member Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| for her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| And we're very hopeful that the bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| that are introduced at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| related to this will pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| There's already some resistance on some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| as they're written currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| So hope that you all will support it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Seeing no further questions or comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3152)|

| 0:52:38| with CDM Smith Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| to provide additional professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3159)|

| 0:52:44| increasing the contract amount by $79,592| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3164)|

| 0:52:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Just a quick note to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| a note of appreciation for the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| that has moved this project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| As you know, this is a $5.5 million project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| to encourage new business investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| and create jobs in this underused commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| Crews have been working hard on this major overhaul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| for the last year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| and now we're just a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| than a month away from completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220222?start=3199)|
