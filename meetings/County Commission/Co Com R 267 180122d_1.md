| 3:02:19| Well, just for the record on this, I have done some work this year as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10939)|
| 3:02:26| Tennessee Right to Farm Act and bringing some of that information back to this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| and frankly, you know, one reason I've been successful in some of that research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10950)|
| 3:02:35| is my wife is an in-house attorney for the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10955)|
| 3:02:41| which gives us, frankly, a great resource if we ever need. Not necessarily my wife for everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10961)|
| 3:02:47| but she's going to know who to go to if we have questions, anything really related to ag, vet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10967)|
| 3:02:52| you know, extension work. She really has a good network in that. I'd be more than happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10972)|
| 3:02:58| enlist her to help us, although it's my understanding from Commissioner Brantley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10978)|
| 3:03:02| that this is one of those, one of these committees that really doesn't meet a lot, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=10982)|

| 3:04:57| Thank you. I'd like to ask Lee Trammell to come and talk to this. We've actually got three things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11097)|
| 3:05:02| that have pulled off a consent that overlap with the Appalachian High Intensity Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11102)|
| 3:05:09| Some of the funding through that task force has also resulted in an overdose death investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11109)|
| 3:05:13| task force kind of as a subgroup of this. You know, we're focusing, I know the governor made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11113)|
| 3:05:18| an announcement today about fighting some of the drug issues that we are struggling with every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11118)|
| 3:05:23| and I thought as we're just basically as we're approving this, this is not something that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11123)|
| 3:05:28| going to debate. It's something we're going to approve but I thought it gave us an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| for you to kind of provide to us and through us our community a little bit of the work of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11134)|
| 3:05:39| task force and some of the things it's doing to help these outcomes in our community. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| you. I'll go ahead and pass it to you. Thank you Commissioner. Lee Trammell, 400 Main Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| Knox County Sheriff's Office. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area that we've been designated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11147)|
| 3:05:54| this money goes to pay overtime to the officer that's assigned to that but it's multi-jurisdictional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11154)|
| 3:06:00| and they do a they do a great job in our area combating drug trafficking. You know, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11160)|
| 3:06:08| talk about the problems that we're seeing, you know, community-wide in our area, in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| in this Appalachian region, you know, it all comes back to opiates for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| heroin and we have a all hands on deck approach, so to speak, combating this. I mean everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11178)|
| 3:06:26| from, you know, from the education to incarceration and everything in between. We're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11186)|
| 3:06:33| different innovative ways every day and, you know, this body has been part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11193)|
| 3:06:38| when and will be part of that conversation going forward. When we talk about things that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11198)|
| 3:06:43| do as a Sheriff's Office and as a community to combat what we see is, you know, the toughest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11203)|
| 3:06:51| epidemic that we've seen in this country in a hundred years. So, it is, there's not a cookie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11211)|
| 3:06:56| cutter approach to this. We're going to use every tool in the toolbox and try to combat this and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11216)|
| 3:07:02| you know, heal or jail people, whatever the case may be, you know, as we can. We're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11222)|
| 3:07:09| everything we can. I look forward to getting into the Governor's address today and seeing exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11229)|
| 3:07:14| where the money's going to go and how it's going to be spent because I don't think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11234)|
| 3:07:20| anywhere better it could be spent than locally on the streets fighting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| We've seen what we've done just here locally with over 400 arrests during the holiday shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11244)|
| 3:07:29| season by our organized retail crime unit and the vast majority of those arrests are all opiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11249)|
| 3:07:36| addicts, all of them, stealing every single day and not once a day, you know, seven to ten times a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11256)|
| 3:07:45| and we've got to do something to curb the tide on this and I think we're headed in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11265)|
| 3:07:50| direction and it speaks volumes about our community when we have the involvement from every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11270)|
| 3:07:56| level of government in our community singing off the same page of the hymn and, you know, I look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11276)|
| 3:08:05| forward to the future fighting this and being part of the conversation. I mean, one thing I might add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11285)|
| 3:08:09| on this, this isn't related to the Sheriff's Office, but just for the benefit of my fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11289)|
| 3:08:13| commissioners because I don't think we have a representative from the DA, but this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11293)|
| 3:08:17| stuff. I think I've seen Chief. Do we do? All right, I couldn't see. So, there he is back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11297)|
| 3:08:21| Thank you, Sam. And John with the Medical Examiner's Office, you know. But I noticed that even as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11301)|
| 3:08:25| of this task force, we're getting some extra computer software and hardware to help track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11305)|
| 3:08:29| these cases. Would you mind, I know these jump around on our agenda, but I noticed all three of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11309)|
| 3:08:36| them were all kind of connected, so if you wouldn't mind kind of. Family, Chief Deputy Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11316)|
| 3:08:41| MD's office. The mission of the drug-related death task force is pretty specific. It's two-pronged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11321)|
| 3:08:48| One is to create a data and intelligence platform for information sharing. And on that platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11328)|
| 3:08:54| we basically do one thing really good is we track all the deaths in Knox County, whether they be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11334)|
| 3:08:59| city or county. We also enable our partner agencies, which is our big partner is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11339)|
| 3:09:04| ME's office. We share the data and we share our expertise. And then we also, on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11344)|
| 3:09:10| on the General's website, we also now have the daily counter where we keep track of the deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11350)|
| 3:09:14| daily. The other part of it is the investigative and prosecution side. And since we've had this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11354)|
| 3:09:20| task force, we've charged 11 folks with second-degree homicide. And we're now treating every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11360)|
| 3:09:26| overdose death scene as a homicide crime scene. We collect cell phones, we take all the evidence we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11366)|
| 3:09:32| can, and we get a lot of expertise from the ME's office in interpreting all that data and figuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11372)|
| 3:09:36| out what the cause of death was. All right, thank you, Sam. Yes, sir. Go ahead. John Lott, Senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11376)|
| 3:09:45| Director for the Regional Forensic Center. In coordination with our partners, we are helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11385)|
| 3:09:50| them to understand drug-related deaths. Each day, my medical death investigators are out on scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11390)|
| 3:09:57| and when they determine that there is a possibility for a drug-related death, we inform not only the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11397)|
| 3:10:03| Sheriff's Office and Knoxville Police Department, but also the DA's office. And so we get an initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11403)|
| 3:10:10| start on that day one. There's no lag time in that. We're sharing data and information across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11410)|
| 3:10:17| each of our concerns. One of the things, though, that there is a lag time on is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11417)|
| 3:10:24| a possible drug death may not end up being a drug death. And it takes us some time in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11424)|
| 3:10:31| make sure that it's going to be classified as a drug death. But as soon as that's known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11431)|
| 3:10:36| we go ahead and inform the DA's office and law enforcement that it is definitely a drug death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11436)|
| 3:10:43| However, they are pursuing every possible case day one. Thank you. Commissioner Gill. Yes, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11443)|
| 3:10:58| Mr. Chairman. Are we seeing any trends, age, sex, geographical location, how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11458)|
| 3:11:11| mothers are involved? I mean, what are your statistical data at this point highlighting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11471)|
| 3:11:18| In 2016, we produced a report on that data. I've taken a quick look at our 2017 data, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11478)|
| 3:11:28| we haven't closed out all of our cases for 2017. But in looking at preliminary data, what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11488)|
| 3:11:35| seeing is this. I expect that we'll have about 300 drug-related deaths in Knox County. Of those 300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11495)|
| 3:11:43| the majority of those will be from fentanyl. And so if you look at what are the drugs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11503)|
| 3:11:50| are causing death, whereas before it was oxycodone and oxymorphone and alprazolam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11510)|
| 3:11:56| those were the dominant drugs for seven years. And now what we've seen, last year there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11516)|
| 3:12:02| shift, or in 2016, there was a shift to fentanyl being the lead and then oxymorphone, oxycodone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11522)|
| 3:12:10| As I've taken a preliminary look at 2017 data, what I see is fentanyl has more than doubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11530)|
| 3:12:17| in the drug-related deaths, followed by cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and then what you see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11537)|
| 3:12:26| oxycodone, alprazolam, and those drugs. So we've seen a definite shift from prescription drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11546)|
| 3:12:34| being the leading cause of death in drug deaths to illicit drugs being the leading cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11554)|
| 3:12:41| Also preliminarily, what we're seeing is that the 45 to 54 year old age group was leading the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11561)|
| 3:12:49| Now what we see is a shift to younger age groups, and of course there's more people in those age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11569)|
| 3:12:55| groups. Preliminarily, I think that the 24 to, or 25 to 34 year old age group will double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11575)|
| 3:13:06| from what it was last year, and then the next age group has gone up also. I have not looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11586)|
| 3:13:14| locations yet, because again, it's preliminary data. I will say that in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11594)|
| 3:13:23| and I apologize, I can't remember the number right off the top of my head, but looking at 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11603)|
| 3:13:29| the number of African-American deaths have doubled, more than doubled since 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11609)|
| 3:13:36| in our 2017 data. So those are some of the shifts that we're seeing. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11616)|

| 3:13:48| So that's preliminarily what we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11628)|
| 3:13:54| And just to clarify one other thing, the monies that we use from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| task force are really to fight the street level drugs, the fentanyl, the heroin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11637)|
| 3:14:02| and those type of things that are coming in from Detroit and Michigan and that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| When John talks about the number of deaths with fentanyl being increasing and the oxys and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11646)|
| 3:14:11| decreasing, that's a result of our legislature doing a great job reducing the number of morphine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11651)|
| 3:14:17| equivalents written in our state, but behind that comes heroin, fentanyl, and to fill that void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11657)|
| 3:14:27| So with the partnerships that we have, and this is really, you talk about a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11667)|
| 3:14:38| really coming together, and like I said, to sing off that same page of the Hamden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11678)|
| 3:14:44| we are doing this in the right way, I believe. I mean, there's no egos in place. All partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11684)|
| 3:14:49| are working really well together because we understand what it really means to our entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11689)|
| 3:14:54| community. Economic disadvantages it brings you folks when you're trying to bring jobs into East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11694)|
| 3:15:00| Tennessee. We have to get a hold of this, and I believe we will. I think we're going to choke it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11700)|
| 3:15:06| out, but we're nowhere near the plateau, I don't believe, and it shows from our overdose deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11706)|
| 3:15:11| They continue to increase, but at some point we're going to reach that and start down the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11711)|
| 3:15:17| and if we can spend money on education, I like that, at a younger age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| the Metro Drug Coalition does a great job educating. In our agency, in the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11721)|
| 3:15:27| Office, we're into schools at younger, we have to get into those children at younger and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11727)|
| 3:15:32| younger ages to try to stop that young age group from swelling those numbers for overdose deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11732)|
| 3:15:39| but absolutely headed in the right direction. Well, thank you. I might just say in one little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11739)|
| 3:15:44| soapbox close on this, and thank you all so much. When I saw this on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11744)|
| 3:15:49| I thought it was a great opportunity for us to learn more. In my past experience, when Brad and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11749)|
| 3:15:55| I were working together, say on child abuse cases, and Sam, you know a lot of the ones we dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11755)|
| 3:15:59| at Child Health, I remember about 12, 14 years ago, I think we had less than 20 cases of child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11759)|
| 3:16:07| abuse that were reported related to drug endangerment, and now you see that dramatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11767)|
| 3:16:11| increase. I think before I left the agency, it was over 200 a year in Knox County that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11771)|
| 3:16:16| reported somewhere related to drug endangerment. Then if you look at the foster care system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11776)|
| 3:16:21| in our community, and the impact it's having on the demand, and you know this, Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11781)|
| 3:16:26| yeah, I mean it's on trying to find good foster homes for all these kids when their parents get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| strung up. So it's not just hitting the homicides, but you're seeing a lot of kids who are effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11790)|
| 3:16:36| without parents. So anything that we can do on this, just to take pressure, there's so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11796)|
| 3:16:41| pressure points than just the homicides that we see. Well, I assure you, the people here at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=11801)|

| 3:21:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was talking to Mr. Green the other day about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12115)|
| 3:22:13| some of the things on his agenda and one of the things I noticed that there are some old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12133)|
| 3:22:18| items on there that goes back to 2010 and we were discussing about it. That ties that property up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12138)|
| 3:22:27| even where it's going to be or not going to be zoned. It's hanging on the order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12147)|
| 3:22:33| So we were talking about it and I was asking him to come here and tell us how we're going to clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12153)|
| 3:22:38| up those old zoning issues and he was going to come here and say, but he was thinking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12158)|
| 3:22:44| same thing too. I would say like minds think together, but we are on opposite sides a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12164)|
| 3:22:49| times. But anyway, we were thinking about the same thing on this. Thank you, Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12169)|
| 3:22:55| especially Vice Chair Bussler. We're not on the opposite sides. We're all headed in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12175)|
| 3:23:01| direction. Sometimes we want to take different roads, that's all. But in this case, the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12181)|
| 3:23:07| that Commissioner Bussler is talking about are tabled items. Those are items that have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12187)|
| 3:23:11| for which an application has been made. The applicant then requests that the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12191)|
| 3:23:17| Commission table those for future consideration with no date set for the consideration of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12197)|
| 3:23:23| items. And they just stay on our agenda forever. There's no mechanism now for taking them off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12203)|
| 3:23:28| for sunsetting them, for re-notifying them. It's up to the applicant to ask that they be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12208)|
| 3:23:34| from the table. If that request is received, the Planning Commission has to vote twice. First,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12214)|
| 3:23:40| they vote to remove it from the table with a date set for hearing it, typically the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12220)|
| 3:23:46| and it's advertised and the public is notified that that item is again on the agenda. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12226)|
| 3:23:54| even things going back to 2006, I wish they ended at 2010. When I came to MPC, I saw that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12234)|
| 3:24:01| wondered why they were on there and had the same thoughts as Commissioner Bussler. How can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| clean this up? And then got other things. But since our conversation, I've directed our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12245)|
| 3:24:11| to first amend our rules of procedure to set a sunset period for the tabled items. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12251)|
| 3:24:17| period will vary based on the type of application. Some of them, the more simple ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12257)|
| 3:24:21| will have a shorter period of time, but none more than about a year for action on the tabled items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12261)|
| 3:24:28| The items that are on the tabled agenda now, we will notify the applicant that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12268)|
| 3:24:34| start taking those off the table and they would be considered withdrawn. And I think what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12274)|
| 3:24:39| clears up is that inability, and I'll explain in more detail, if an applicant had, let's say I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12279)|
| 3:24:47| developer and I approached with Mr. Steeley with a request that I would rezone, I'd like to get his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12287)|
| 3:24:57| property rezoned so that I could develop it and the contract would be contingent on that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12297)|
| 3:25:03| Well, I find out something that he's got nutty squirrels living on his property and I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12303)|
| 3:25:08| to deal with those in my development plan and I table the rezoning request. Well, he does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12308)|
| 3:25:15| he's effectively tied up if Commissioner or Chair Smith wanted to buy that property and have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12315)|
| 3:25:22| rezoned, he could not apply for a rezoning because there's an active rezoning request on it that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12322)|
| 3:25:27| not been acted on. So it ties up that property. I think this will clean up a lot of things and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12327)|
| 3:25:32| I appreciate Commissioner Bustler bringing this up, bringing this to our attention. And anytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12332)|
| 3:25:38| things don't make sense, please let us know. And along that line, if I may take the liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12338)|
| 3:25:43| I know there's been some question about why, you know, when a sector plan amendment comes to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12343)|
| 3:25:49| with a rezoning and MPC has recommended denial of those, the sector plan amendment, if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12349)|
| 3:25:55| commission deems that it's a worthy request, it has to go back to MPC again for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12355)|

| 3:26:18| the planning commission on a sector plan amendment. Therefore, you have to initiate if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12378)|
| 3:26:24| sector plan amendment that comes to you with a recommendation for denial from the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12384)|
| 3:26:29| commission and you see that that is a reasonable request, you have to then make application to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12389)|
| 3:26:36| MPC. But this commission is the applicant and that's something that, and we'll do some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12396)|
| 3:26:43| research, but lacking any legislative amendment or revision, we have no power to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12403)|
| 3:26:49| because the judge has ruled that that's the process that we have to follow and we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12409)|
| 3:26:54| change that. But again, there are likely other things that we can deal with that don't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12414)|
| 3:27:00| a lot of sense on our agenda, on our processes, and anytime you have one of those, please bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12420)|
| 3:27:05| it to our attention. Any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Commissioner Andrews? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12425)|
| 3:27:11| sir. Gerald, when you talk about somebody tying up somebody's property, when they apply, so let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12431)|
| 3:27:17| say developer A is applying for landowner B's property, there's got to be a contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12437)|
| 3:27:25| contract or a control of that property for that amount of time. How can the MPC hold that on table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12445)|
| 3:27:33| when the contract has expired? Because the application, and that's a good, I'll do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12453)|
| 3:27:40| more research because I'm not, don't know all the legal ramifications. I'll talk to our attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12460)|
| 3:27:46| but we have a valid application and a valid request. So, you know, the developer A may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12466)|
| 3:27:56| had the property owner B's permission to make that application. That's still valid. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12476)|
| 3:28:01| not subject to that contract, that separate contract. That's my thought and I'll check on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12481)|
| 3:28:07| it further, but I think that we look at it as a valid application, not bound by any other contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12487)|
| 3:28:15| and on that application, we have the property owner state that the applicant has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12495)|
| 3:28:25| to apply for that rezoning. I would put a sunset on that request. I mean, and we will look at doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12505)|
| 3:28:31| that. It sounds like a simple fix there. Okay, thank you. Mr. Schoonmaker? Thank you. Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12511)|
| 3:28:39| did I understand you to say that if there's something that's on the table list, which I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12519)|
| 3:28:43| looking at, you're saying that the property cannot be rezoned or no other activity on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12523)|
| 3:28:48| Because we have an active application. That's been our attorneys. Well, it just seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12528)|
| 3:28:55| there's one on here in my district that you guys have already, two years later, you guys have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12535)|
| 3:28:59| moved on with. Well, in theory. Okay. And then there's some on here that were like a land swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12539)|
| 3:29:07| deal. Actually, I think in your district with the mayor's office or something, and that's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12547)|
| 3:29:13| on here from 2015. So yeah, this would be great if you could clean this up and save printing costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12553)|
| 3:29:20| for those extra four pages. More in confusion when people see those tabled items, they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12560)|
| 3:29:25| they're still active in an opportunity that something may happen, so they often contact us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12565)|
| 3:29:30| with concerns that may not be well founded. Any further discussion? Thank you. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12570)|
| 3:29:42| Director Green. Next item. Item number 41 is discussion to set a public hearing date regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12582)|
| 3:29:51| the RP Rural Preservation Zone Ordinance. Okay, we need to set a time for the public hearing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12591)|
| 3:29:58| What is your office pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12598)|
| 3:30:06| Do you want to do it after the work session on February 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12606)|
| 3:30:11| So the public can come if they wish. It's the most convenient. If there's no objection, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12611)|
| 3:30:17| call a meeting for that time. Like 6 30 or something, or I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12617)|
| 3:30:22| Say 6 o'clock, or we have been saying 6 o'clock or immediately up on conclusion. I would do 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12622)|
| 3:30:34| Not, but you can't do it before 6 o'clock, though. It would have to be 6 or after. Right. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12634)|
| 3:30:41| February the 20th? I don't have a calendar in front of me. Yeah, Tuesday, because the 19th is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12641)|
| 3:30:49| Tuesday. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12649)|
| 3:30:54| Uh, where are we gonna run into the our meetings earlier that day? Then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12654)|
| 3:30:59| no, because the city council checked account. Is it not conflict? I got the calendar. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12659)|
| 3:31:04| not meeting that Tuesday. Okay. All right. Well, we're good. Next item. Item number 42| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12664)|
| 3:31:12| is discussion regarding the Charter Review Committee. Okay, I've brought this up several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12672)|
| 3:31:17| meetings in a row, and we've yet to get a whole lot of feedback on it. So I wanted to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12677)|
| 3:31:24| all one last chance to, uh, have a have a discussion about this item. We'll open up the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12684)|
| 3:31:34| Commissioner Anders. So what you have now is nine appointees by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12694)|
| 3:31:39| nine appointees by commissioners and districts and other district. They have to be from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12699)|
| 3:31:44| district, right? And then nine commissioners. And I think the mayor's appointees have to be from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12704)|
| 3:31:49| each district, giving you a total of 27. That that is a lot. So it was awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12709)|
| 3:32:01| Commissioner, right? Well, my first thought was to knock it down to five commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12721)|
| 3:32:07| but then you have four districts that would be underrepresented on the Charter Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12727)|
| 3:32:14| That's right. Thank you, Mr Chairman. I think I may have expressed this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12734)|
| 3:32:19| going along the same lines is Commissioner Anders. It's going to be difficult to pare down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12739)|
| 3:32:27| the number of commissioners that would be when we're starting with nine. Who would be the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12747)|
| 3:32:33| that you would cut out? And who would you then include? And then I extend that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12753)|
| 3:32:39| discussion or argument to the appointees of the mayor versus the appointees of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12759)|
| 3:32:48| It's going to be a large, because you and I participate in it, a large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12768)|
| 3:32:56| more people than there are seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12776)|
| 3:33:01| But we just do it once every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| Eight. Is it eight? Yeah, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12783)|
| 3:33:11| two things I'll point out on this. One, I like that there's 18 citizens on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12791)|
| 3:33:19| because I don't think this needs to be a political body that makes these decisions on our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12799)|
| 3:33:25| I think it's really good to have civic public input on it. Two, for me, it was a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12805)|
| 3:33:33| It was actually my first time working in a government type setting. And I think it gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12813)|
| 3:33:41| people an opportunity to participate if they're willing to. And you can have 10 people on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12821)|
| 3:33:48| board, or you could have 27. And it really, it boils down to do people want to participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12828)|
| 3:33:55| Sure, it's hard with a board of 27 to get your voice heard. But if you've got something to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12835)|
| 3:34:00| you'll figure out how to get it heard. So, you know, I know that some people said that's too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12840)|
| 3:34:07| many people, but I really feel it's important to make sure that this is, there are more citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12847)|
| 3:34:13| on this board than politicians. Well, this is just going to be a necessary way to do it. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12853)|
| 3:34:23| if we're going to have that many people, I didn't realize this is a once every 10 years that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12863)|
| 3:34:27| to do eight years, eight years. Okay. It's just something we've got to do and deal with it. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12867)|
| 3:34:34| the hardest thing managing this is probably going to be trying to figure out if they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12874)|
| 3:34:37| meeting in here, or it might actually, it could be easier to be next door if the sound system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12877)|
| 3:34:42| was better, because you could get more people circled around extra tables. So it's got to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12882)|
| 3:34:47| on TV. Got to be on TV. All right. Got it. You used to have 19 commissioners set up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12887)|
| 3:34:57| So you'd have, you know, nine and nine and plus one to break the tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12897)|
| 3:35:08| But, you know, it's 19 that you'd be sitting up here. So you got room for 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12908)|
| 3:35:14| The big thing that we would have as commissioners, and like the appointees of citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12914)|
| 3:35:23| is we don't only represent ourselves or our own thoughts. We must represent the people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12923)|
| 3:35:29| in our district and their ideas. So I guess you'd have individual ideas, and then we'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12929)|
| 3:35:39| represent our districts and kind of take our politics out of it when you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12939)|
| 3:35:47| politicians sitting up here. And if you realize that we are representatives, we represent people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12947)|
| 3:35:53| we don't represent our own ideas. So we must voice those. So we got to think of it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12953)|
| 3:35:59| instead of being politically or whatever it is, our thoughts try to make us neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12959)|
| 3:36:06| So anyway, that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12966)|
| 3:36:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think all nine commissioners should be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12976)|
| 3:36:21| I can think back, I went to a lot of the ridgetop, hilltop meetings. They worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12981)|
| 3:36:28| hard, hard. Then when it came to county commission, it was already done, but I'm going to say already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12988)|
| 3:36:33| done. County commission hashed it over and over, and basically everything that some of the ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=12993)|
| 3:36:40| they came up with was great ideals. I'd just like to save some time and make sure that all nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13000)|
| 3:36:46| districts will be represented, and hopefully when it does come, we've got one voice and we won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13006)|
| 3:36:53| changing. Mr. Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chair. What I wanted to add to the conversation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13013)|
| 3:37:03| this committee, charter review committee, only comes up with the verbiage to be placed on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13023)|
| 3:37:10| ballot. It's still up to the citizens of Knox County to approve these changes if they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13030)|
| 3:37:18| them. We're just the mechanism by which they get placed in print and added to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13038)|
| 3:37:27| Mr. Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and just so I understand the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13047)|
| 3:37:34| we would have to have it on the ballot, and it would be the presidential primary of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13054)|
| 3:37:42| so that, pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13062)|
| 3:37:49| Okay, so in other words, for 2020, but we would need to have everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13069)|
| 3:37:57| okay, we would have to have everything in place by basically January of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13077)|
| 3:38:03| the committee already meeting and solved it and get the paperwork in and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13083)|
| 3:38:07| Mr. Wright. No, we would have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13087)|
| 3:38:11| we would have to have something on the ballot this election cycle so that we would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13091)|
| 3:38:16| so we would know how many people to see for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13096)|
| 3:38:19| Mr. Schoonmaker. Okay, the nominees have to be listed on the ballot, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13099)|
| 3:38:24| No. If you're going to make any changes, that needs to be on the ballot, but if we're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13104)|
| 3:38:30| to make any changes, nothing needs to happen. Mr. Wright. We, by a vote of two-thirds, could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13110)|
| 3:38:35| recommend that on this election cycle that we change the way our charter reads to the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13115)|
| 3:38:41| of people that sit on charter review committee, but that vote would have to take place, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13121)|
| 3:38:47| it is the last election we'll have before we will have to have things that the charter review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13127)|
| 3:38:52| committee changes on the ballot. Correct. Is that making sense? Yeah. So we would, the drop dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13132)|
| 3:38:58| timeline is what? A month or two. Okay. Election commission needs it 90 days prior to the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13138)|
| 3:39:06| so if you're going to the August statewide election, it'd be 90 days prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13146)|
| 3:39:11| it's got to go in front, it's got to be in the election commission's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13151)|
| 3:39:16| That's why we're addressing this right now, is do we, if we want to change that committee that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13156)|
| 3:39:20| going to meet. Okay. How does it stand right now? 27. 27? How would you break that down, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13160)|
| 3:39:34| You agree not to let anybody from the 7th on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13174)|
| 3:39:43| Commissioner Thomas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let's go back up for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13183)|
| 3:39:49| It says 27 people, right? Yeah. How many commissioners, everybody? Nine. Nine. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13189)|
| 3:39:55| nine. And how many citizens? Eighteen. Eighteen. Mayor picks nine, one from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13195)|
| 3:40:05| each commissioner picks someone. So you still got the mayor picking some, but just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13205)|
| 3:40:09| citizens from commissioners selecting them? Yes. So the process of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13209)|
| 3:40:21| is they have to already have a relationship with the commissioners, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13221)|
| 3:40:25| Not necessarily. Well, I guess what I'm trying to aim or drive at, I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13225)|
| 3:40:33| have somehow where all citizens that are interested somehow get their name before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13233)|
| 3:40:41| So if they want to come and talk to commission, explain why they are passionate about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13241)|
| 3:40:47| it might give them a better opportunity to actually be selected by the commissioner in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13247)|
| 3:40:52| their district or something. Or maybe the commissioner holds a meeting in his district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13252)|
| 3:40:57| and says, you know, everybody that's interested, come and meet with me and let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13257)|
| 3:41:01| I just want to make sure that people that don't already have a relationship with a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13261)|
| 3:41:06| still have an opportunity to be involved. See what I'm saying? Yeah. And that's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13266)|
| 3:41:12| of a good way to do it, is to hold in your district a meeting. That's generally what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13272)|
| 3:41:17| happened last time. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Are you trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13277)|
| 3:41:25| to a certain number of people that you think that you could still be somewhat focused and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13285)|
| 3:41:32| not get too off? I'm just bringing up the idea of knowing that we have to have something on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13292)|
| 3:41:39| the ballot this time around if we're going to change the size of that committee. But do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13299)|
| 3:41:43| have an opinion on the number of people, your personal opinion? My personal opinion is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13303)|
| 3:41:49| thought it worked well last time. You know, going through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13309)|
| 3:41:55| you know, there were some people that didn't show up after some meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13315)|
| 3:41:59| but we never had a problem having a quorum, I don't believe, did we? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13319)|
| 3:42:05| the process worked well, I thought. You know, as I said, that was my first experience in working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13325)|
| 3:42:11| in any kind of committee for any kind of government entity. And for me, it was a very positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13331)|
| 3:42:16| experience. It kind of what led me to where I am right now was that was my first involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13336)|
| 3:42:22| And I think that 27, while large, is workable. And when you're looking at the charter, there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13342)|
| 3:42:32| to digest there. So sometimes it's good to have people that take and focus on different sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13352)|
| 3:42:38| of it. If you get this too small, I don't believe everybody will be able to get their hands all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13358)|
| 3:42:44| the way around the whole thing. Okay, that's what I was looking for. Sounds like to me that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13364)|
| 3:42:55| no mood or anything to change it from the 27 and just kind of leave it like it is because it worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13375)|
| 3:43:01| and there's no equal way to get it. So just leave it alone. I mean, it sounds like what everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13381)|
| 3:43:07| kind of thinking. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think here's an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13387)|
| 3:43:23| to take a look at what this needs to be right now. We have new sets of eyes on this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13403)|
| 3:43:30| and the appropriate recommendations would serve us long term to take a look at it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13410)|
| 3:43:37| Thank you, Mr. Bradley. Thank you. I'm for 27. I think that's a good number. It worked before and I think it will work again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13417)|
| 3:43:50| So if it works, why mess it up, you know? Okay, I think we've brought an end to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13430)|
| 3:43:58| Is there any announcements? Back to our discussion, do we have to make a motion to get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13438)|
| 3:44:05| proceed to get it on the ballot then? Do we have to do anything formally from this body? No, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13445)|
| 3:44:11| the way it is right now. It's 27. If we do nothing, it stays 27. If we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13451)|
| 3:44:17| change it, we would have to take, we'd have to put it on our agenda, pass it by two-thirds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13457)|
| 3:44:24| hand it over to the Election Commission for them to prepare the language for this coming election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13464)|
| 3:44:30| cycle. And then the people would have the choice of do they want to vote for that change or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13470)|
| 3:44:36| Okay, so the Election Commission just does it on their own authority to go ahead and put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13476)|
| 3:44:42| on the ballot for the Charter Review Committee is 27, is what I'm getting at. Nobody has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13482)|
| 3:44:47| It's part of the charter already. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13487)|
| 3:44:53| Got you. Okay, I'm sorry. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13493)|
| 3:44:57| Before we go to announcements, I spoke with Representative Harry Brooks, and he's filing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13497)|
| 3:45:02| the legislation for the utilities in lieu of, and he wants to make sure that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13502)|
| 3:45:08| stands behind him and whoever the Senate sponsor is. I don't know if we got a Senate sponsor yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13508)|
| 3:45:13| or not, but when Representative Brooks calls upon us, we need to support him 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13513)|
| 3:45:22| And speaking with him, he wanted to make sure that this stays out in front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13522)|
| 3:45:27| the forefront of our minds. So thank you. If he'll give us the bill number too, once he files it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13527)|
| 3:45:34| I can get that filed, and then I'll send it to Drew, and Drew can send it out to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13534)|
| 3:45:39| Commissioner Carringer. Thank you. I've got two announcements. One is I just wanted to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13539)|

| 3:49:49| As we're all aware, Discovery has bought out Scripps Network. And what is somewhat a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13789)|
| 3:49:58| unusual move that when a larger company buys a smaller company that the larger company would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13798)|
| 3:50:03| move part of its operations to the smaller company's campus. Discovery will be moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13803)|
| 3:50:09| their national headquarters to the Scripps site in the third district. I think that's truly a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13809)|
| 3:50:15| testament to the site they built and the culture and the company that they have. I do believe there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13815)|
| 3:50:21| are a lot of people to probably thank for what has happened, from the governor, to both mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13821)|
| 3:50:28| to the development corp, to the chamber of commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=13828)|

| 4:06:45| some county appointees voting against and some city appointees voting for, but they recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14805)|
| 4:06:51| that the Planning Commission or the County Commission approve PR zoning at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14811)|
| 4:06:56| up to 3.5 units per acre. Finding that that density would be compatible with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14816)|

| 4:08:17| This zoning ordinance amendment is a growth of a recommendation found in the East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14897)|
| 4:08:22| community plan. The citizens attending the community meetings and participating in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14902)|
| 4:08:27| process ask that a new tool for preserving agricultural land be developed. The staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14907)|
| 4:08:34| taking that direction developed this plan with input from members of that community and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14914)|
| 4:08:40| sectors of Knox County. The planning staff does not intend to impose this on any property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14920)|
| 4:08:46| It would be at the request of a property owner. What exactly does this, and I do respect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14926)|
| 4:08:53| people of East Knox County who came up with this, but I'm wondering what what uses are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14933)|
| 4:08:58| through this this zoning that are not available through agriculture and you know we just passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14938)|
| 4:09:03| the another ordinance related to uses for agricultural land. And no uses are prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14943)|
| 4:09:10| that would be permitted in the agricultural district. The biggest difference is the the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14950)|
| 4:09:17| the this the concern expressed by the residents of East Knox County and we've heard it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14957)|
| 4:09:22| other portions of the county is that the agricultural zone is more of a large lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14962)|
| 4:09:29| residential zoning district and that it allows one residential unit per acre. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14969)|
| 4:09:36| zone would allow the employee housing necessary to operate the agricultural enterprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14976)|
| 4:09:41| but residential density would be limited to one dwelling per 15 acres. Is there a minimum size track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14981)|
| 4:09:49| I think that we had debated that and I'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14989)|
| 4:09:59| look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=14999)|
| 4:10:03| There is no no minimum lot size set forth in the ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15003)|

| 4:10:31| upon I guess passage of this ordinance we can put this on our list of things to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15031)|
| 4:10:40| that when we have our soon to be scheduled ag committee this will be one thing that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15040)|
| 4:10:44| review to make sure that we properly communicate that out to other parts of our county that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15044)|
| 4:10:49| have an interest in adopting this as well. And staff did meet with staff of the Ag Extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15049)|
| 4:10:56| office to work this out and try to address their concerns and again it's we don't anticipate a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15056)|
| 4:11:02| of use of this but there may be a few people have expressed interest in it and it's just a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15062)|
| 4:11:07| that's available to try to preserve agricultural lands and to meet the wishes of the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15067)|
| 4:11:15| requested this. Commissioner Andrews. What is, Gerald, what is the, I've tried and kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15075)|
| 4:11:23| glazed over it, it didn't look deep into it, what is the, so if one generation says I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15083)|
| 4:11:29| preserve it, two generations away says I want to sell it, is there a protection that's irrevocable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15089)|
| 4:11:35| or is this? No this is just a zoning change and we tried to keep it fairly simple understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15095)|
| 4:11:42| that we don't want to tie up properties for several generations or even between owners and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15102)|
| 4:11:48| we're even debating reducing the fee for and we likely will reducing the fee for zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15108)|
| 4:11:53| in this district because they would largely be significant sizes of properties and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15113)|
| 4:11:58| want that to be a burden either. All right, thank you. Is there a motion? No, I have a couple more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15118)|
| 4:12:04| questions. Gerald, what type of activities will be allowed in this zoning? There are any of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15124)|
| 4:12:13| that are protected by the Tennessee state law under the Wright Farm Act would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15133)|
| 4:12:17| Agricultural production, roadside stands for sales of agricultural projects, products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15137)|
| 4:12:25| operation of machinery used in production or processing of agricultural products. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15145)|
| 4:12:32| outside of the agricultural use because we're well aware that we can't touch anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15152)|
| 4:12:37| that deals with that. Agriculture, not a whole lot, natural conservation areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15157)|
| 4:12:45| there are the rural retreat, churches, dog kennels, bed and breakfast style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15165)|
| 4:12:51| lodging facilities, trying to address both the traditional agricultural uses and some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15171)|
| 4:12:56| more innovative ones like event centers and small lodging facilities. Now the rural retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15176)|
| 4:13:03| ordinance that we passed, it had a minimum lot size, did it not? Minimum setbacks? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15183)|
| 4:13:08| So if somebody had a one acre lot in this zoning, they could come and ask for a rural retreat and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15188)|
| 4:13:14| would not have to meet those setbacks? They would, that's the rural retreat standards which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15194)|
| 4:13:21| carry over into this zoning district. Okay, okay. We would still have the same standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15201)|
| 4:13:27| All right, and is there anything that if someone placed their land into this zoning that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15207)|
| 4:13:32| in any way infringe upon the rights of adjoining landowners or in any way influence what they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180122d?start=15212)|
