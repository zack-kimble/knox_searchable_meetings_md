| 1:36:18| would be my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| And the planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| the sector plan designation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| would be a change of policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| that would set the foundation for more planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| A logical approach to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| is amending the neighborhood commercial designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| that would allow auto repair businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| as a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| and address the broader perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| of what's permitted in neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| rather than trying to fit 20 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| Mr. Green, I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| I'm going to jump in on this briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| and then get to Mr. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| I just want, you answered my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| because that was, this is part of what the discussion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| Can we build into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| the address and the issues of the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| You just alluded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Well, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| And in the planning staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| they said that if the planned commercial zone was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| they recommend that they impose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| the landscaping requirements of the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| which we say we're fine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| At the time of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| We say we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| And we have no problem with the 50-foot peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| and the additional landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| We think that their concerns would be addressed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| And that was the reason I continued to pose that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| But you have to ask her if that was sufficient or enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| because we could easily, I'm not saying it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| I'm just saying part of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| I don't agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| but I'm just trying to take the opposition perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| as we try to move to resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| And I understand that completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| and I understand the opposition doesn't want a business there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| and I understand that perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| and I'm sensitive to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| but the sector plan already calls for businesses to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| So we just want to make sure we put a business there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| that fits in with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| Well, I'll say this is my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| I'm hesitant to send back something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| that could potentially change neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| just because of this one request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| when we as a commission have talked about updating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| so many other aspects of our zoning codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| as one of our future goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| And I would think that in that context moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| and I'm speaking more so, Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| to my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| and going back to one of the goals in our retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| to update all of our comprehensive planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| and knowing that down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| we'll be probably appropriating significant amounts of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| over the next two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| to both update our general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| as well as some of our codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| to bring in things like plan developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| and I would think that as part of that intentionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| when we're looking at everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| that would be a good time to review neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| rather than doing it in response to one specific request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| which to Mr. Smith's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| could then apply towards the rest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| My general take on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| is I'm probably going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| Sorry, Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| just because I do feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| this is a potential nose under the tent issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| and if it came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| where it matched up with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| I'd vote for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| but that's kind of where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| So, moving on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| the last light on is Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| Well, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| what's the preferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| I mean, I agree with you on the planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| I don't think that it's a good fit right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| What's the most productive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| of getting this accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| from your perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| I think looking at the neighborhood commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| and see if the auto repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| with some standards for that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| would be a fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| in the neighborhood commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| To save cost and time and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| can we table this until that can be reviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| Is that legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| I defer to Mr. Sanders on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| I don't think there's going to be any objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| from the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| I don't think that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| If it saves cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| there would be no objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| from the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| I just would need to talk to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| about what their contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| for this property looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| and if that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| would still be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| Well, in tabling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| it would keep the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| there's no more cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| if we just bring it back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| when it comes back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| on the agenda, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| tabling I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| is exactly the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| Defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| Defer would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| a more preferable term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Can I make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| that we defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| until Planning has an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| Neighborhood Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| and see if it's acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| by the Planning Commission body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| to amend the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| and send it back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Is that a legal motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| that you defer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| to a date certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| so that there's no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| January, February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| that we defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| until January's planning meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| to allow for time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| for this to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| to see if it can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| I sympathize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| with the landowner behind you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6082)|

| 1:41:24| and her husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| But, in reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| if Mr. Wagle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| popped up tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6087)|

| 1:41:31| and put a store in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| he could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Yes, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| The owner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6094)|

| 1:41:40| It could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| the owner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| already approached Wagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| Can you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| I'm giving that as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| It could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| it could be any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| any fast food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| or any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| any supermarket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| But there's not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| They did approach Wagle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| But it's too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| But anybody could come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| and do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| If they could put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| somebody wanted to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| a gas station there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| or a commercial business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| small grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| they could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| A produce market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| could do so right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| asking for a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| amendment because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| it's there to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| could go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| and it's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| going to go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| and that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| comes with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| five lane highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| and maybe Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| could speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| about what you and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| spoke to before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| before we walked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| into the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| I would not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| but neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| commercial is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| it's already planned there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| I think that that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| the work was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=6161)|

| 2:01:44| Otherwise, we do not have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| Okay. Okay. And then, thank you, Mr. Stoddard. This is now for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| So, just so, to follow up on Commissioner Anders' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:56| Planner Albertson originally said 4.8 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7316)|
| 2:02:02| It did go to the Agenda Review Committee, and it was backed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7322)|
| 2:02:08| And then, your records indicate that when the applicant came to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| they wanted a denial of their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| Is that kind of unusual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| Unusual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| Not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| I'll take the blame or the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| I pushed for the 4.5 units an acre because it's adjacent or across the street from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| It's at a commercial node. It seemed a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| The Planning Commission had a different opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| and we often revise our recommendations after the work session based on comments we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:49| I can't recall where an applicant has come up and requested denial of their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7369)|
| 2:03:02| Typically, they accept a recommendation and then come here and ask for more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| I think this is just a unique approach, and I appreciate a new way of looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| And then, now, is this Mr. Fulgen? Am I pronouncing it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| In the gentleman from the community, here's I'm sure where the confusion is arising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7398)|
| 2:03:25| You've got 30.5 acres to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| How many buildable acres will these structures be going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| Ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| Okay. Then, do you follow what his concept was of saying that you're almost then 15 units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| My thought was, honestly, no disrespect, that was creative math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| I mean, I can make math say whatever I want it to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| and I thought that was a creative way of trying to argue your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| but it defeats the purpose of trying to put more density in a smaller area and create more open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7437)|
| 2:04:08| It completely defeats the purpose of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| Yeah, and we understand that part of the property is a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| Correct. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| Okay. So, basically, 20 acres, there was going to be no roads, no construction on 20 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:26| Under the current design, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| For the 133 lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| Correct. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| Okay. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| Mr. Snowden, is this proposal the main road for this proposal directly across the street from Castile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7482)|
| 2:04:56| Yes, just slightly off the line, but for all practical purposes, it makes a four-way intersection with Castile Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7496)|
| 2:05:03| And so this property will utilize a stoplight coming out onto Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| Yes. If approved, Mr. Biddle will be required to modify the signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| to allow for those nearside signal heads for his residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| And, obviously, this is not the first or last time we're going to hear from members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| about traffic and the immense amount of people moving into one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| I think it's been a commonplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| Do you have any update on improvements to Hardin Valley Road or this corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7531)|
| 2:05:37| that would address some of those traffic issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| Is there anything on the way? Are we still thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| As part of the mobility study, we looked at a couple of different options for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7543)|
| 2:05:51| I think general thought was that a large-scale improvement of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| wasn't really warranted at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| It's primarily peak hour related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| If you go out there in the afternoon or morning peaks, it's relatively bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| But if you go out there in the middle of the day, it's not too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| And, unfortunately, we have areas that have problems through that whole course of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| and that's where we've kind of focused our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| What we do want to do is to have better connection north and south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| so we are going to work on looking at alternate alignments for Campbell Station in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| But as far as anything warranted along Hardin Valley now, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| There's nothing in the pipeline short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| Thank you for the info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| Mr. Valiant, a quick question for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| Gerald, do you all record those pre-agenda meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:52| I know we have minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| I don't think we do auto recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| I'll check and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| I'd like to hear that meeting and how that discussion went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| Why is it, you know, we had this discussion, I guess, a year or so ago or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| I guess it's been a little more, and we got to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| And why are we coming back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| Because everybody agreed to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| Well, the reason we did this is I had a conversation with Mr. Green, with another client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7639)|
| 2:07:27| and it seemed like at that particular time MPC was sort of modifying their position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7647)|
| 2:07:36| on wanting to have more density in smaller area and open up more green space around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7656)|
| 2:07:43| And that's exactly what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| So I don't know if I talked to Mr. Green specifically about this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7666)|
| 2:07:52| but then we came back and applied and I think we went and talked to Mr. Green about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| And I think the staff had a favorable view of what we were trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| because this is a unique development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| I mean, with the pavers and the way it's laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| I think it's an upgrade from what the typical development that you're going to find in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7691)|
| 2:08:18| And everybody seemed to be full speed ahead until I had that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| And I know who the commissioner was who really popped up and started talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7704)|
| 2:08:32| And then we came out with a second report, which went back to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| But our whole purpose, as my understanding is, is that the Metropolitan Planning Commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| was wanting to have higher density developments going in using less land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7723)|
| 2:08:50| And that's what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| Has there been any more dirt movement on there since this last discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| You know, that was a misconception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| And I think Mr. Snowden can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| At one time there was, I think, some stumps taken out or some dirt or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| But Mr. Biddle has been in total compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| And I think you might get a better view from that from Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| He can tell you exactly the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| Those statements, and this came out really at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| We wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| But Mr. Snowden knows the history of that, and that was inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7766)|
| 2:09:35| I guess our alternative is, I mean, it's just going to sit there and continue mudding down every time it rains, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7775)|
| 2:09:43| if it ever rains again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| I struggle with this a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| I think it's a neat concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| It's using less land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| I do like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| And I think that these townhomes will probably yield less children than three houses to an acre would probably yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:07| Are they two-bedroom townhomes or is it two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| I mean, I guess more of a confirming statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| We were at three on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| And the footprint of land that's going to be disturbed really for this development is not changing that dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| It's really just adding a little higher density because you're already at, what, 90 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7831)|
| 2:10:39| And something like that could happen, could break ground tomorrow, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| So we're really talking about not disturbing any additional land, still leaving the green space the green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7844)|
| 2:10:52| yet adding a few more homes to this density in that compact space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| much in the same sense that we've done with a lot of PR zones around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| Can you explain the reforestation and what's going to take place there and how long it's going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:12| Well, I guess one thing to mention and to kind of clarify, we currently have a grading permit for this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:20| And they've had the pre-construction meeting and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| So it is already set up and could be ready to go at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7883)|
| 2:11:30| Part of what we're going to do is it's a reforestation design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| It's a design specifically to save money but to increase ecological value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7895)|
| 2:11:42| It increases the slope stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| Basically, we're taking a really super high-performance spray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| and putting it onto the slopes to keep it from eroding off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| In that spray will be a liquid topsoil, wildflower seeds, and I'm sorry, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| But before that, it will be reforested with seedlings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| And we've worked with probably four different foresters, local foresters here at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7923)|
| 2:12:11| Theresa Knoxville, Casey Kress with the city urban forester, and one other forester to come up with this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7931)|
| 2:12:22| It's a concept used all the time in mine reclamation techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| So what it will really do is something that's much superior to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| we've seen in the rains back in February where we're having a lot of slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| This would prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| And not only that, but then you've got these trees, which is about 300 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| And so even if half of them die and don't make it, that's basically a 12 by 12 grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| And it's four different species, so we have plenty of diversity of trees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7972)|
| 2:12:59| And so all of it is to reduce runoff and to stabilize the slopes and to reduce the sediment runoff also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7979)|
| 2:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| So this project is going to use less land, reforest land and give land away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| The first one asks about do you have lots of mature trees existing on the property now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| There is no motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| So the chair would like to entertain a motion to act in one way or another on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| I'd like to make a motion that we grant 4.5 as the planning commission had approved in the pre-meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| We have a motion on the floor from Commissioner Anders to approve per initial MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:03| Am I saying that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Yes, that's the number that was applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| And that was seconded by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| Now, time for additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Just a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Is this a vote to approve the appeal or to deny appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| Or can we make like Commissioner Anders did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| So this is an appeal, but planning commission has simply made a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8067)|
| 2:14:34| And ultimately, the rezoning of a property is a legislative decision up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| And so the requirement is simply that the rezoning be submitted for consideration to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:48| and then acted on by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| So they've considered all this, it appears, the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:57| I don't think, you know, sometimes you will have an issue whether a change between planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8097)|
| 2:15:07| and county commission is a substantial change that would need to be resubmitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| but I don't think that is the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| It's a density determination, not a different zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:19| So I don't think that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| So, yeah, you've got the authority to act here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| It's not a sector plan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| So it's a straight rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| I will say, though, I don't want to be remiss and not mention this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8131)|
| 2:15:37| but since the planning commission did deny this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| it's one of those that requires a specific statute that requires the county commission to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8142)|
| 2:15:50| And it's going to seem odd because you're all here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| but it requires a majority favorable vote of the entire membership of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| So that's different than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| If some of you weren't here, it would just be a majority of the members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| But since you're all here, a majority of the members present will pass this if it's a favorable vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| But if there are some members that pass or don't vote, you have to have six votes to carry this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:20| because that's a specific requirement of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Is there any additional discussion on this item that is properly before us under a motion from Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8194)|
| 2:16:35| I've just got a question on the numbers again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| We have total acres of 30.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| Is that correct, Brad, for your understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| And he's asking for 133 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| So that's 4.36 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| So you're asking for more units so they could go from 133 lots up to whatever 4.5 is times 30.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:10| So you want to give them more buildable lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| Well, I was using the number that the staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| And that's why I brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| Do we need to readjust that so it matches no more than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| whatever number of units that they want for the project if you want the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:33| Would that make that, based on your math, Commissioner Skinmaker, about 4.3 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| I do have a question I forgot to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| Mr. Biddle, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| So you get this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| I probably should have asked this first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| You get this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| What's to say you change your design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| Gerald, is there a way that you could get the zoning and completely change your design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| and we're back to giving it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| We could, and that's one of the things we hope to overcome with the plan development approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8290)|
| 2:18:17| that we're working towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| Having heard all the commitments from Mr. Biddle, if he changes the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| staff's recommendation will be for denial of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| Of his concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| You won't approve anything but this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| This design because of the commitments he's made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| You deal with that, Mr. Biddle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| On the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Will you give your name and address, Rusty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| It's Rusty Biddle, 10784 Hardin Valley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:47| And just to be clear, our engineering is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| We are approved through Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| The concept plan we take back will be exactly what we've already got permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| I'm just giving everybody ease of mind in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| But back to your real quick point of clarification, would the right number be Mr. Biddle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| Mr. Schoonmaker was doing some math here and he said that in terms of acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| and the number of units you asked for, I think that was closer to 4.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| And I think the request is 4.8 or 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| You know, if we do the math and figure out whatever the number that's in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| and it's maybe a little bit less than 4.5, if we figure that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| is that a number that you'd be comfortable with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| I think it's right at almost 4.4, so it's not much difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| We had asked for 4.8, and I think staff had recommended 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| That's where that number came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8382)|
| 2:19:43| Commissioner Anders looks like he's got his calculator out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| I'm not doing very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| The law director has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| Is there any number of ways that the commission can express a permitted density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| So it's not necessary that you express it in a number of dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| You can express it in a total number of dwelling units for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| So you don't have to do the division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| Math, that's addition's tricky friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| So, Commissioner Anders, you could restate the motion based on the number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8413)|
| 2:20:20| instead of an acreage calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| We'll just make it at 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| It was your second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| Have we got a second on that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| So the motion before us is to grant the appeal based on 4.4 as stated in the original Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8439)|
| 2:20:48| Commission recommendation with the specific recommendation of 4.4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8448)|
| 2:20:54| And that's from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| Is that clearly stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| Does everybody understand what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| Are we doing, because the recommendation was 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| Now we're changing this to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| I just need to make sure this is 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| 4.4, which is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| I just need to make sure that's clear because we've said a couple of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| All in favor of this recommendation, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| I believe that that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| Is there any other business to come before us as it relates to the zoning meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part2?start=8506)|
