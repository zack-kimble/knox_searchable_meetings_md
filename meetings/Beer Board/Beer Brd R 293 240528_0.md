| 0:03:08| because they didn't need it because the venue that they were hosting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=188)|

| 0:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Officer Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| Mr. Patel has not completed the CAS class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| He completed one around a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| They were supposed to mark it, but he'll probably have to contact somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| I don't have that in the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| The last time I have him in the records is March of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| so I'll need to get some documentation from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| they have your contact info on the Beer Board application info| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| so they can get in touch with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| He just completed one for the Kennedy a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| maybe two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| So he should have some documentation from when he did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| and can just supply that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| If the background check is clear, is that correct, Officer Presley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| Yes, the background check is no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| We're just still waiting on the CAS class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| I did look him up under name to try to see if he attended for another business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| but I couldn't find him under name, so we can, you know, check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| He should have a certificate that he can show me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| We'll proceed on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=605)|

| 0:10:24| Do you know if there's a scheduled appointment with building department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| We're waiting on the building department to, I guess, approve the floor plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| and then once that's done, then the fire marshal will come out and do the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=636)|

| 0:11:49| Last year we did some concerts down at the amphitheater for the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| and we gave $30,000 to local charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| This year we're doing five concerts at the amphitheater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| and hoping to give $60,000 to $75,000 to local charities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| and there are three charities involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| So we're just using the amphitheater because we think it's a beautiful place to do shows in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| and we're going to try to raise some money for some local charities, and Joy of Music is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=730)|

| 0:19:54| some time now. So, I'm going to move to extend 90 days. I heard some seconds, so we'll go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1194)|

| 0:20:45| the design for the wall, because they told us we needed a letter from the engineer, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| we got the letter from the engineer, and then they said they wanted drawings, and it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| them 90 days to do anything. Okay. And so, it's just been dragging out, dragging out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| because at the end of the day, there's still just a beer catering permit, and we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| have our beer permit. Okay. You know, blah, blah. We can go on forever about it, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| going to need some more time just to get everything stamped off so that Stormwater and the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| department will be happy. Oh, your location near the hill there, where the tent was? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| ma'am. And the new wall is? Okay. I pass it when I take my kids to school. So, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| As he mentioned, they already have their beer permit. This is just the catering, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| because the catering is new, they have to go through the whole process again, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| there's some changes that the city's ordinance changes are now kind of kicking a bunch of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| things back and forth. There's delays with the city permitting department, all the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| so as a result, I'll make a motion to extend for 90 days. I think that should be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| All those in favor? Anyone opposed? All right. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Have a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1310)|

| 0:22:27| of occupancy, do you need some inspections? Yeah, I submitted everything about a few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1347)|

| 0:22:36| do? Okay. Does anyone else have questions for the applicant? Okay. Move to approve with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1356)|

| 0:22:49| but do you need 30 days, 60 days? I think 30 days should be good. Yeah. They said it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| can take two to four weeks, so I don't really know. I would do at least 60. Okay, 60 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| fine. Okay. All right. So, move to postpone for 60 days. All right. All in favor? Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240528?start=1383)|
