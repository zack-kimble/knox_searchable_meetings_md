| 0:00:00| Well, let me respect your time and help us begin as close to 6 as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| I think Tim has had his interview, so we're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=9)|
| 0:00:15| My name is John Lawler and I'm the Director of the Tenure Plan to End Chronic Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=15)|
| 0:00:20| A lot of the faces in this room are familiar because I've been to your neighborhood group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=20)|
| 0:00:24| or you've been to a different meeting that I've been in, and so I appreciate you being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=24)|
| 0:00:28| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=28)|
| 0:00:29| The purpose of tonight's meeting was to take advantage of Tim Clont, who's come to us from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=29)|
| 0:00:36| the Corporation for Supportive Housing, to spend some time talking to people from different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=36)|
| 0:00:42| neighborhoods who would like to know more about this concept that we talk a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| in the Tenure Plan called Permanent Supportive Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| So before I turn the agenda completely over to Tim, what I'd like to do is just quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| go over with you the highlights of the Tenure Plan and remind you, kind of contextualize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=57)|
| 0:01:04| where Permanent Supportive Housing fits within the overarching strategy of the Tenure Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=64)|
| 0:01:12| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| First of all, remember it is called the Tenure Plan to End Chronic Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| Our target population is the chronically homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=79)|
| 0:01:26| Chronically homeless individual is defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| as a disabled individual who's been homeless for more than a year or had four serious bouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| with homelessness over a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| Two important components there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| The term disabled is very important, and then the length, the duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| These are individuals who have been on the street for quite a long time, in fact are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| going to have a hard time getting off the street on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| I'll go into that a little more in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| When you think about how many of these individuals are there in Knoxville, we estimate they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| between 15 to 20% of our total homeless population in a year is chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| The last time I talked to our data collection service, they said in the past year, over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| 600 individuals have received services from a homeless service provider that can be classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| as chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| In the past year, we've provided services to over 600 of these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| Why you say, well, if it's 15 to 20% of the whole homeless population, why focus on just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| 15 to 20%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Why not focus on the 85%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| There are two real good reasons to that, really three, but I have two up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| First of all, chronically homeless individuals are very expensive to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| Tim's going to elaborate on this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Really, he's going to show the difference between the cost to our community of a chronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| homeless individual when they're not housed versus when they're housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| The reason they're expensive to our community is a lot of times, because they are disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:14| they will have an income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| A typical situation would be that maybe it's the first of the month and I do get my check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| I pick my check up and I leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| Some surly characters are out there and they know that I get my check and they know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| I'm defenseless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Maybe they take advantage of me and they steal the check from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| In the process, they injure me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| If I'm injured, somebody's going to see me on the road and probably call and the ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| will come pick me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| We saw in the paper today, the ambulance charge is over $500 per service and they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| up 15%, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| They take me to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| I get to the hospital and they find out, gosh, this guy's not only injured and we can deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| with that, but we're dealing with it at a pretty expensive price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| Some of the things he's saying, there may be an issue related to mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| They do a quick questioning and they say, gosh, given some things we're seeing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| maybe this person will be best served for a couple of weeks at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| I'm transported to Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| In Lakeshore, it's $1,200 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| I'm there two weeks and all of a sudden, they discharge me and I'm back on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| I'm back on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| I've been on my medications and I'm pretty good at that point, but I have a prescription| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| in my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| It's going to be hard for me to get that prescription filled because I don't have a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| I'm not sure how I'm going to get to the drugstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| All of a sudden, I start doing what is called decompensating and I get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| All of a sudden, I end up somewhere and I'm accused of public disorderliness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=296)|
| 0:05:06| Police come pick me up, take me to the jail and I stay there at about $180 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| When you follow these individuals around, you see how expensive they can be because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| if you're not stable emotionally or you have some issues that are just demonizing your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| life, addiction-type issues, your life is just going to be chaos out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| The 10-year plan is saying we want to target these individuals because we know if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| are given a safe, secure place to live with case management services, a relationship with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| a case manager who helps the assets of the community be delivered into the lives of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| individuals, these individuals can be stabilized and their lives can slowly be worked to reintegrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| into healthy lifestyle patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| They can become good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| All of a sudden, they go from being folks that are out there in a chaotic situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| emotionally as well as their living situation is chaotic to a place where it's stabilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| and they're beginning to be contributors back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| The cornerstone strategy of the 10-year plan is what we call housing first model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| Tim is going to elaborate on this, but what we mean by that is we believe that the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| effective way to solve chronic homelessness is to get a chronically homeless individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| into housing as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| That person enters housing not alone, but in a relationship with a case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| The case manager helps that individual get the required services to reach a point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| stability and succeed in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| The good thing about this for Knoxville is we're not the first people to try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| This is being tried and it's being implemented, not tried, but implemented all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| I was talking to the guys in my office today and I said, I think they're saying 230 other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| communities have similar plans and they corrected me and said 350 metropolitan areas in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| country currently have similar plans to ours, 10-year plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| This strategy is being used nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| What we're seeing, HUD's most recent data, and I'm probably stealing some of Tim's thunder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| but it shows that 85% of the chronically homeless individuals that go into permanent supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| housing are still there a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| It is a successful strategy, but it's permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| It's an individual having a lease, paying rent, and connected to him with the case manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| in that housing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| That is housing with the support, that's what we call permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| As you know, as part of the 10-year plan, our commitment is to scatter the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| of this housing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| I used to always say throughout Knoxville, and Bob Becker would always say, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| and that's exactly what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| This is the mayor's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Mayor Haslam and Mayor Ragsdale both endorsed this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Our commitment is to spread this out throughout Knoxville, which means Knox City and Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| County, but it's important to you as neighbors, as it was to me, to understand what is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| thing called permanent supportive housing and how will it affect me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| If it is built and developed and operated in my neighborhood, what effect will it have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| on my neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| What effect will it have on a lot of different important things that we all care about as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| we live in neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| We've asked Tim Clont to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| He works for the Corporation for Supportive Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| He'll tell you more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| It's a national organization that's been around for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| They don't develop permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| They are in existence to help permanent supportive housing be successfully developed, successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| operated, and provide the necessary services to the residents that it serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| Tim is here not as a developer, not as an advocate for the 10-year plan, but just someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| that knows a lot about permanent supportive housing and is here to provide that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| and then give you plenty of time to ask questions and thus get your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| I really encourage you tonight to take advantage of Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| He's here and he has more experience and knows more about permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| than any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| If this is that important to the 10-year plan that it is, let's make sure we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| this product before he leaves here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| So, without any more said, Tim, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| As John said, my name is Tim Clont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| I'm with the Corporation for Supportive Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| I'm really just to give you a little bit of a better idea of what maybe qualifies me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Not only do I work for the National Intermediary specifically focused on supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| but prior to joining CSH, I was the housing policy advisor to the director of the Arizona| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| Department of Housing and then was a housing policy advisor to a mayor and city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| So, I really approach housing not only from a product, from a bricks and sticks structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| but also from policy decisions as well and understanding how it impacts public systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| as well as people in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| So, hopefully I can address any of those concerns tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| So, CSH, the Corporation for Supportive Housing, as John said, we've been around for about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| 17, 18 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| And we were actually founded as a very small program, an offshoot of the Ford Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| in New York City to work specifically on supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| And we worked there for a number of years and really started to see the benefits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| supportive housing, not only to communities, but for the residents in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| And since then, we have now grown to 14 offices in 11 states and the District of Columbia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| working in both urban, suburban, and rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| So, we do a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| This is one of the things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| We go around the country and we talk to communities about the benefits of supportive housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| help address any questions or concerns they have about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| And we also work at the federal level on policy agenda, specifically related to homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| And then we also operate a very substantial loan pool in which we invest or lend to supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| housing developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| We don't own or manage any of the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| We function as an intermediary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| So we generally are the go-between between the public system, the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| and our provider partners, whether they be service or housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=706)|
| 0:11:55| So I want to talk to you a little bit about the features of supportive housing, but in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| order to do that, I think it helps to put it into context within the traditional homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I think to a certain extent, some of this may still exist within Knoxville and Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| County, and it certainly does around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| And so what you'll see in this graphic here, and I'm running off a little bit, but on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| left, and I apologize if you can't read this, but hopefully graphically I can walk you through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| In the circle, you have the homeless individual or the homeless family who's in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| Something happens in their life that causes them to be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| In the traditional system, the next stop, or should I say the first stop, is an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| You can generally be up there for about 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Emergency shelters oftentimes, you know, you're in by 7 p.m., you're out by 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| It's a safe, warm, dry place to sleep, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| No services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| You spend maybe your 30 days there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| You might cycle into a transitional shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| You might be there for about 120 days where you, someone's doing an intake, an assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| starting to set up some referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| From there, you may go on to transitional housing, generally up for two years, case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| management services, and then from there, if you're deemed housing worthy or you graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| you go into permanent housing, which may or may not have supportive services attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| So one of the fundamental tenets of your 10-year plan is predicated on using the housing-first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| approach or the housing-first model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| And what the housing-first model does is it takes you, oops, if you could go back for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| It takes you from that episode of homelessness, from that crisis, and you basically skip through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=809)|
| 0:13:37| all of the hoops, if you will, and you go right into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| Now, the housing-first approach does not imply that there is no place in a community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| no use for an emergency shelter or for transitional housing because there will always be households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| in crisis that need a place tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| And some populations do benefit from transitional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| But what the housing-first approach suggests is that the best way to address and end homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| is to take them from homelessness right into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| And I have quite a bit to cover in a relatively short period of time, so I'm going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| and run through it all before I respond to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| But if there's something that I say that you really don't understand and you want to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| right then, just shoot your hand up and I'll do my best to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| So the housing-first approach really has two central premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| The best way to end homelessness, as I said, is to take the individual out of homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| and immediately put them into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| But then beyond that, it's wrapping supportive services around that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| And it's the services that are necessary for that individual to be able to sustain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Okay, so this is really fundamental to really our discussion tonight and to the success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| You know, it's difficult for me to answer without knowing about the population, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=892)|
| 0:15:14| I have some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| I'll talk about some of the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| Okay, well let me talk...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| I have some information shortly about success rates of services, and we can make some assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| based on that, but then if my slides don't answer your questions, I'll do my best after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| Okay, well, so let me share with you our definition of supportive housing, just so you know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| And John has seen this, so I like to think that we're pretty much on the same page with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| what CSH defines as supportive housing and what you're defining as supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| So it's permanent, affordable housing combined with a range of supportive services that help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| people with special needs live the most independent lives possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| Okay, so again, as you'll see on the next slide, really two essential features, supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| It's the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| So it's permanent, which means it's not time limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| You're not in there for 30 days or 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| You're in there as long as you want or need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| It's deeply affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Whenever you go to rent a market rate apartment or get a mortgage or whatnot, generally a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| test of housing affordability is you can afford about 30% of your monthly income for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| housing expense, and that doesn't matter if you're low income or high income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| It's a general rule of thumb in the housing industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| So in order for supportive housing to be affordable to a homeless population, to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| homeless individual who may have no income, you know, 30% of zero is zero, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| So supportive housing really needs to be deeply affordable for that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| And it's independent housing, which means it is a tenant-landlord relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| They have a lease with rights and responsibilities that is independent from the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| The services are flexible, meaning the services that I need are very different than the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| that you need and that someone else may need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| And remember, the services are always designed to maintain housing stability, and it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| be any range of services, almost always case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| It could be, you know, mental health treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| It could be substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| It could be return to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| It could be GED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| It could be parenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| It could be any number of things, but it's whatever you need to be able to maintain your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| housing stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| The services are voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| That means I can move into supportive housing, and I may or may not choose to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| in your services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| I'll be the first to admit, this raises a lot of red flags in communities and with providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| because they want somebody who's in there taking advantage of the services and to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| This puts a lot of responsibility on the service providers to make services accessible and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| attractive to the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| And again, the service is independent, always focused on housing stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| So why do we need supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Some of my numbers are based on our national research, so we'll put them a little bit into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| On any given night, depending on what you read, across the country, 1.5 million homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| John said that locally, you have about 15 to 20 percent of your homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| is chronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Nationally, we see really it's more about 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| So CSH has a 10-year goal of producing 150,000 supportive housing units, because that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| go a very long way, if not all the way, of ending chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| And why do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| Right now, so many communities are just managing homelessness, or they're dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| They're getting people off the street overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| They're getting them fed, may or may not be getting them service, but it's more of a management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| Very rarely do you go into a community who's working on ending homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| They're sort of dealing with the homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| And all too often, there are emergency systems or other institutional systems that are created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| to care for the population, but in reality, they're just exacerbating the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| We have public hospitals that are caring for homeless individuals, but once they're treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| they're then opening the door and putting them back out onto the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| And so it's a very vicious cycle, and it's costing public systems an awful lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| I have some figures later that what we've learned nationally, but John was telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| about a local expert, Dr. Noe, who has estimated that a homeless individual costs the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| system in Knox County about $37,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| You know, and that's everything from, you know, the time that the police spends speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| to them, you know, the emergency room, the ambulance, the detox, whatever that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| is taking advantage of, $37,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| So again, we have found success with a number of populations with supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| First and foremost, the chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Using the HUD, the Department of Housing and Urban Development definition, it is an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| again, who's been homeless for at least, continuously homeless for at least one year, or four episodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| of homelessness over the course of three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| It's also a benefit for individuals, again, who have cycled through the institutional systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| They've either cycled through them, or maybe they're being discharged from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| So the cycling through is generally your hospitals, maybe your, you know, your county jails, discharged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| from the institutions, more your public psychiatric hospitals, your state prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| And really, supportive housing is for the people that, if it weren't for the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| they will not access the services and be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Okay, so we're talking about a whole host of populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| Of course, chronic homeless with disabilities, veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| You know, across the country, it's estimated that upwards of 25% of the homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| are veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| And this, unfortunately, is only being exacerbated right now with the conflicts in the Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| And for the first time ever, we're seeing female veterans of combat coming back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| And I think most of you would probably agree with me, at least those of you familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| the Veterans Administration system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| It's a very male-centric system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| And because that has served the population well, but we have all of these women coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| back from combat to children who don't know them, or husbands that have left them, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| whatever situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| And they're finding themselves homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| And the Veterans Administration, the system that they have set up right now, is not responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| to the unique needs of those women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| So we're doing a lot of work around veterans housing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| Families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| It's hard to get accurate counts around homeless families, because generally, family homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| looks very different than individual chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| Families tend to be homeless for shorter periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| So they could still technically be considered chronic if it happens four times over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| course of three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| But unfortunately, HUD doesn't, will never recognize, or at least at this point, doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| recognize families ever being chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| Only individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Families also tend to maybe sleep in cars, what we call couch surf, you know, so they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| stay with family or friends a week at a time here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| So you don't really see them like you do the singles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| With youth, it's estimated that upwards of 7% of youth from any economic background will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| be homeless at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| We're seeing a lot of youth right now being discharged from foster care systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| They're turning 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| The state assistance ends, and they go right into homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| The reentry population, 650,000 individuals released from state and federal prisons every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| year, and many thousands more from county jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| Sometimes they're going right into homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I always tell a story, I was doing some reentry work in a state out west, who shall rename| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| nameless because I'm sure they wouldn't want them being identified with this story, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| I was sitting around a table, they were working on homeless issues with a lot of veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| and one of the wardens who was the warden of the only female prison in the entire state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| said, well, you know, we give the women $50 and a new dress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| And everybody sort of laughed, sort of like the uncomfortable laugh, and I thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| must have been an inside joke, and so later I asked somebody, so what's this $50 and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| new dress joke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| And they said, no, seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| They open the gate of the prison, they give the woman a $50 bill and a brand new dress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| and let her go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| And now this prison is literally in the middle of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| And unless she has someone on the other side waiting there for her, the chances of her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| returning to homelessness are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Or returning to the behaviors to survive that might have exacerbated her homelessness is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| much greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| So we're doing a lot of work right now around the country with what we call in-reach and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| discharge planning and working with these correctional systems six months prior to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| getting out so that we can make sure that there's someone on the other side of the gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| waiting for you and that they're not adding to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| And individuals living with HIV and AIDS, the prevalence of HIV in the homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:25| is 10 times that of what it is in the general population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| And when you factor in a mental illness, it's 15 times that of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| So some very unique challenges with that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| So hopefully, I don't know if you can really see this slide very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| I'm sorry it's not larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| But one of the questions, again, we often get, who really lives in support of housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| And so what this chart shows, and I can sort of walk you through some of it, we conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| three initiatives or sort of evaluations around the country to find out who's really living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| in support of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| The first column, which has the acronym of HHISN, which was our Health, Housing, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Integrative Services study, looked primarily at six projects in the San Francisco Bay Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| The next column was just projects in the states of New York and California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| I think the one that's probably most relevant for Knox County is the one that's called THCH,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| Taking Healthcare Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| That was an initiative that we conducted in nine localities around the country, both urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| and rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| In fact, your neighbors to the north of the Commonwealth of Kentucky participated in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| And so we feel like the numbers that we got from that are much more reflective of probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| the sort of mainstream America, if you will, of who lives in support of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| And for those of you who can't see it, what you see is that 55 percent of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| had a serious mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| And that may sound like a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| It may sound like a concentration of people with mental illness living in a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| But you can also think about it as 55 percent of the people who aren't living on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| with mental illness, who are accessing the mental health services they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| About a quarter of the people dealing with a substance abuse disorder, whether it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| drug or alcohol, and 25 percent co-occurring disorders, meaning more than one, 7 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:16| HIV AIDS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| So pretty much what we would have expected to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Just to give you an idea of, again, who we see living in supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| And the next slide speaks a little bit more to the demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| About two-thirds supportive housing residents, men, one-third women, ethnicities both under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| and over-represented, not surprisingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| It's going to be largely dictated by the community that they're drawing from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Something we found really interesting here that we didn't expect, the mean average, excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| me, the mean age of the supportive housing resident, 49 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| You know, I read something a while ago, it was about family homelessness, saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| the average age of a homeless American right now is eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| And so, you know, you really think about, you know, it's not the people necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| that we're all seeing on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| It just speaks to the family homelessness issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Anyway, so I want to talk to you a little bit about some of the benefits of supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| housing and speak to you about some of the research and give you some facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| And I'm going to address really three primary beneficiaries, if you will, of supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| I'm going to speak about the people in supportive housing, the public systems of which we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| all part of, and then the communities or the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| So it works for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Because, you know, we have a tag, housing is healthcare, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| And so we can show that, again, we've done a study, and it's about 11 different cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| around the country, and this is what we're finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| One year in supportive housing with this population, emergency room visits down 57%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Now, keep in mind, these are people who weren't paying for the emergency room when they went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| there anyway, and they probably took an ambulance, down 57%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| Emergency detox, down 85%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Where do you usually, how do you usually end up in emergency detox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| It's because you're being picked up off the street, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| So 85% off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Incarceration rate, down 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| A 50% increase in earned income, this is really important, because the majority of the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| individuals and the folks coming into supportive housing are employable, either immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| or with some employment training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| So they can get back to work, they can start contributing to community again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| And it just adds to their own economic self-sufficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| And John referenced this fact in his comments as well, that more than 80% are housed after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Now, I will tell you, yes, the percentage, compared to them going into, prior to going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1725)|
| 0:29:02| into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Yeah, so taking a look, right, so taking a look at the folks living in these developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:16| that we've researched, and saying one year prior, taking a look at what they, the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| systems that they utilized the year prior, and then going one year post-housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1760)|
| 0:29:37| Now, I'm saying that the rates at which they utilize those services have big emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:50| rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| For example, the year prior to housing, they all, let's, X number utilized emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| One year post-housing, 57%, the utilization rate was 57% less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1798)|
| 0:30:09| It's the same people that were pre-housing, post-housing, so it's the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:25| If that, and if I haven't responded to your question, I can talk to you a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| about the survey afterwards, unless others have the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| Now, I will say, for the 80% staying house for one year post-housing, or post-entry I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| should say, what we have seen two years out, it does go down a little bit, and that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| be for any number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| We're seeing stats now in the low 70s, two years post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| We like to think, and I think that we're right in some of our assumptions, that not everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| who enters supportive housing needs to be in supportive housing forever, and so maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| two years out, a certain percentage of these folks are moving on to unsupported affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| There will be no doubt folks who don't want to live within that environment, don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| to participate in the services, or any number of reasons, and they may cycle back into homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| They may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| I will admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| But I think the 80% post one year is a great success rate, and it's better than what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| seeing in almost any other intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So again, sort of getting at my housing as healthcare, even when the participation in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| services is not a condition of tenancy, so this meaning voluntary services, we can show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| on average, 81% of supportive housing residents will utilize healthcare services, even if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| it's made available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| 80% are going to utilize mental health treatment services, and 56% substance abuse services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1912)|
| 0:32:02| So, I mean, that speaks volumes, because it's getting the people the help that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| to be stably housed, and even when it's voluntary, they're still taking advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| There was really a groundbreaking report in HIV housing that came out last month that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| looked specifically at the National AIDS Housing Coalition, and they were actually able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| show that if they took HIV positive homeless individuals and put them into housing, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| only did their own personal healthcare improve, because of what you're seeing above, 81% are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| taking advantage of the healthcare, but it also reduced the opportunistic risks of infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1952)|
| 0:32:40| So it means it's taking them off the street, they're not sharing needles, they're not trading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| sex or whatever, and so therefore, it's a benefit to the individual who has the disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| and it's also a prevention activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| So getting into the savings of public systems, this one may be, I don't know if you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| to be able to read this, but in 2004, we studied the cost of public systems in nine cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| around the country, both mid-sized cities, so like a Columbus, Ohio, in Atlanta, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| then some larger cities, and we took a look at the cost of that public system for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Now, you may not be, I don't know if you're going to really be able to read that from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| where you're sitting, but I think visually, it's a very telling story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| If you look all the way to the right, the public system that's represented there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| the cost of a day in a hospital, and we found the three highest cost cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| We looked at the same nine cities across the board, but of those nine, the three that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| the most expensive, San Francisco, Atlanta, and New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| San Francisco topping out at about $2,000 a day just to be in the county hospital, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| then you start going down to the other public systems where a homeless individual might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| spend a day, mental hospital, shelter, prison, jail, and then supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:56| We use this graph to show, to illustrate, that while there certainly is almost always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| a cost to a public system of providing supportive housing to an individual, it is much, much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| less than the cost of providing another public system to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| Oftentimes, they don't need to go to the emergency room and be admitted overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| What they probably need is a primary care provider that they can make an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| with, visit, get it reimbursed by insurance, and then they go home that night, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| $115 versus $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| That includes the cost of providing the supportive housing, so it's both the housing and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:56| I don't know your local market, but I would venture to guess yes, less than $70 a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| to the public system, because that's $2,100 a month, yeah, definitely less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:12| That was sort of our national study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| One that came out a few years ago that I like to share, especially with communities who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| are looking at the Housing First model, comes out of the city of Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| This came out in 2006, so in 2004, the city of Denver decided, we're going to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| a pilot program that starts to address ending chronic homelessness, and the way in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| we're going to do that is through a Housing First model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| The city of Denver knew, at that time, by their best guesstimates, they had 513 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| living on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| They had enough funding for 150 supportive housing units using the Housing First model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| The bars that you see on the, I guess it's to the left of them, the lighter purple, was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| the cost of the public systems of those 150 individuals 24 months prior to entering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Those 150 individuals went into housing, and then what you see to the right of it, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| is sort of the darker pink or the magenta, is the cost of the public service, same public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| services to the same individuals, 24 months post-housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| So they tracked 150 people for 48 months, 24 months prior, 24 months after, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| they found is that the average cost savings per individual to the public systems, $31,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| per individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| So when you multiply that by the 150 individuals, the pilot saved $4.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| That's gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Remember, supportive housing and services isn't free, I mean, it does cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| So when you factor in the cost of providing the housing and services, the net savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| to the public system was still about $4,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Again, multiply that by the 150 people, $711,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| If the city of Denver would have had enough money to provide supportive housing to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| 513 individuals they had living on the streets, the gross savings to the public system would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| have been about $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| The net savings, about $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| I don't want to imply that supportive housing is free, because it's not, and it does cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| money, but I think when you're looking at it as a cost benefit to other systems that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| many of us might not think of homeless individuals utilizing on a regular basis and the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| of those systems, it really is staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| So the next slide, because I always don't want to be accused of showing really big cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| Portland, Maine, 60,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Now the gross amount of their savings, the dollar amount, of course, is going to be much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| This particular pilot was 99 homeless individuals, but if you can see, I'm not sure that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| can see it, but on the left side we show the percentage of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| Health care, 59% savings in the public systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| Mental health, 41%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| So it just goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I have honestly never seen a study of supportive housing, whether we commissioned it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| I've never seen a study that shows supportive housing costs more than the public benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| from it, and I would admit to it if I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| It may exist, and I just haven't seen it, but I mean, you know, with numbers like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| the scale would really, really have to tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| The housing would have to become so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| So okay, so it's a strategy that works for communities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| We hear a lot of concern across the country about the impact that supportive housing has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| on neighboring property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| The Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University released a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| actually just a few weeks ago on this very same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| As far as I know, it is the only study of its kind that looks specifically at the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| of supportive housing on neighboring property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| I'll speak a little bit about affordable housing, because it is core supportive housing is affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| but this is the only one that we really know of that focused really on supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| and they looked at 7,500 supportive housing units in New York City over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| Again, I get it's New York, but the average size of the project, 48 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| So we're not talking huge developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| We're talking, you know, pretty common, pretty typical size supportive housing developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| So what we found, what they found, the prices of properties closest to the supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| actually increased in the years after the housing opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| Now, they define closest to supportive housing as within 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| 500 feet is about a tenth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| I don't know what your average size city lot is here, but, you know, let's say roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| on the same block, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| No adverse impact on the property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| What they did find is properties within 500 to 1,000 feet, so within a tenth of a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| to a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| The property values did show a decline as soon as the supportive housing opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| However, over time, the property values actually then started to increase steadily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| And what the assumption was in this particular study is that there were some very real fears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| around what supportive housing would do to that community, and so therefore people were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| nervous to buy there, or the housing was devalued, and then once the housing opened, they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| realized that their fears were unfounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| Now, you know, the real estate market does crazy things, especially right now, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| can only make some assumptions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| You know, I will speak to the second bullet, though, and I'll address your question in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| The second bullet, you know, I was a little surprised that it had absolutely no adverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| impact on the property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| I would almost expect, again, a gradual decline during development, maybe as soon as it opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| and then expect it to go back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| But think about it, you know, quality supportive housing really is unrecognizable by any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| us, and if you're living within 500 feet of a vacant lot, an abandoned building, or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| underutilized structure, anything that goes in there that's quality is probably going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| to have a positive impact on your property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| So that's really, I think, what that bullet speaks to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| And also the density, so meaning the number of units, and the tenancy, whether it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| all supportive housing or mixed with others, did not have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Well, yeah, I mean, you know, I think that probably 90 percent of the homeowners in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2497)|
| 0:42:01| room have lost equity on paper for reasons unrelated to supportive housing recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| I mean, some of it's just the whim of the real estate market, and I can't speak specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| to your situation, because I don't know your individual housing market, but I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| that if you, again, if you have an underutilized property in your community, across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:33| I would suggest so that if you have a building that's underutilized or vacant, that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| has more of a negative impact on your property value than putting it to its proper public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| So did you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Sixty-five percent in the borough of Manhattan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2570)|
| 0:43:10| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Oh, I mean, they're spread throughout the five boroughs, but 65 percent of the supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| housing in New York, in this particular study, is in the borough of Manhattan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:33| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| I agree with you, and the only reason why I actually include this slide is because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| only study that we know of nationally that looks specifically at supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| And why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Because, you know, there's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Because there's 7,500 units of supportive housing in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| In most other communities, you could do a study there, but you're not going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| the critical mass to be able to really make an educated assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:22| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| In this particular study, I do not believe they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Now, in the next slide that was commissioned by Project Home in Philadelphia, they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| did just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Project Home in Philadelphia, again, another large city, but it's where the study's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| A developer and provider of transitional housing, supportive housing, and affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| So, they looked at the impact of all of their housing developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| So, I don't want to misrepresent and say this is just supportive, but it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| You know, it's all affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| They were working in disinvested neighborhoods, because it's generally where it's the easiest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| to develop this type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Housing's less expensive and there's less resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Immediately following the opening of any of their developments, none of the neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| property values had a negative impact, or it did not have a negative impact on any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| the neighboring property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| The years following, what they found is that the neighborhoods that they were working in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| actually had greater rates of appreciation in that as the city of the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:09| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:29| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:47| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| You know, it's, um, I think sometimes instead of focusing on what's going into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| and its impact on the property values is take, like, for example, what is there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| If it's a vacant lot and it's offered up to market, anyone can, you know, it's zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| anyone can come in and do multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| If there isn't that level of confidence that investors and developers and homebuyers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| renters and whomever needs to develop that piece of land, it will sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| And that will, I will suggest, have a greater negative impact on your property value than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| if someone comes in with confidence and develops something on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| And we all understand that drug dealers live in apartments and in houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| They're renters and homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| We agree on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| And we agree that individuals with serious mental illness are homeowners and renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| And that we really don't have a lot of, we may have some influence around what goes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| our neighborhood, but we have much less influence who comes into our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:43| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2931)|
| 0:49:06| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:20| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:38| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:47| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| And I think that your comment actually, I think, supports a lot of what I was talking about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| in that when the residents are provided the services they need and we see the success rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| you shouldn't have the situation that you experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| Follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Let me, I appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| So I do, because, and I think that the provision of the supportive services, as we see, both in my presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| and in your comments, are really critical to the success of it being supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| And if these are really burning questions and they're short, I'll take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Otherwise, I'll finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| I wasn't aware that it was being shown on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| So the question was really more of a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| It was a request to me to repeat the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| So my apologies to those who didn't hear the questions, and I will do so from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| And if this is one last short burning question, I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3111)|
| 0:52:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| I understand your question or statement, and that is, is this housing where individuals come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| they are stabilized through services, and then they're moved out into other housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| which brings in another cycle of people and creates sort of a revolving door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| You know, I can speak to a supportive housing model, and the short answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Because supportive housing is permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| You're in the housing for as long as you want or need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| There are some individuals who will need supportive services for the rest of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| There's another segment of this population who only need supportive services long enough to stabilize their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| They may choose to stay in supportive housing because it's an affordable option to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| and they may have occasional case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| But individuals will leave that housing on their own accord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| or when they violate a term or condition of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| So I would suggest to you that a supportive housing project is not a revolving door project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| Okay, and I'll just go ahead and finish these last few slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| The Wellesley Institute, our friends up in Canada, they actually did a really interesting study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| where they looked at the impact that supportive housing had on neighborhood and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| and really sort of the sense of community, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| They found, you know, not surprisingly, these are individuals without a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| probably don't have cars, so their economic footprint is very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| They tend to shop locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Neighborhood businesses loved having supportive housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| It was a very captive audience, a very captive consumer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| They contributed to cohesion on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| Folks were walking their dogs two or three times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| They were walking to the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| They were walking to wherever they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| They really became part of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| They also rallied around some very different neighborhood initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| and efforts with the city around noise, speed, and crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| Interestingly enough, only 45% of the neighbors knew that that was actually supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| Now, maybe they didn't live there when the project was being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| because a lot more would probably know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| but I think that just speaks to how sort of under the radar this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| So I'm just going to say a few words about developing supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| I'm going to make an assumption that most of you have some familiarity with just affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| You may call it low-income housing, but just regular affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| An affordable housing, or any housing for that matter, has two budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| It has a capital budget, bricks and sticks, how much it costs to build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| and then how much it costs to operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Supportive housing really just has one additional budget, and that's services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| With affordable housing, generally your only condition is that a household make under a certain amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| So you're basically screening everyone else out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| In supportive housing, it's all about screening people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Believe it or not, the residents of supportive housing are more likely to become a victim of crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| than they are a perpetrator of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| These are oftentimes marginalized individuals, heightened fears of security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| and when they venture outside of that supportive housing project where it's safe and secure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| they're more likely to be a victim of a crime than they are to commit one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| There is a strong coordination between property management and supportive services within the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| So you have somebody who's always looking out for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| The hallway's clean, the grass is cut, the trash is picked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| and then you have someone who's also working on the supportive service site to keep the individual housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| Depending on the size of the project, there may be room for on-site service delivery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| meaning the individual goes down to the lobby into a private office for case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| In smaller developments, maybe they go someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| Supportive housing almost always includes materials and furnishings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| So individuals are moving into places with beds and dishes and sofas and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| And that does help maybe a little bit on that revolving door look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| There aren't moving vans pulling up every single weekend and taking one out and moving one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| So there are a few different basic types of supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| One is a single site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| It's a building in which 100% of the units, whether they're 5 or 50 or 500, are all supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| So one building, one tenancy, one type of tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| There's a scattered site where the supportive housing may be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| it's a few units all throughout a city or a county or a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| And they could be part of another development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| So if you have a 50-unit apartment building over here, maybe five of them are supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| And the 25-unit building over here, two of them are supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| So that's what we call a scattered site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Integrated housing is really picking up a lot of steam around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| And that's where we're integrating two types of populations –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| supportive housing and then almost always just with a more affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| what we call an undesignated population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| So a few development options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| There are a number of ways that supportive housing is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| Turnkey, someone else builds it, a for-profit or a non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| and then turns it over, turns the key over to the service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| Sometimes service providers are co-developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| They enter into a partnership with another for-profit housing developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Master leasing, popular in certain parts of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| It's where a service provider will go out and lease 100 units all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| Maybe it's a floor in this building and a couple units here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| They hold the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| They execute one lease with the owner saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| I'm going to pay the rent on all 100 of these units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| whether someone's living in them or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| and then the provider subleases to their clients, to the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| And then a service contract is really just where a housing owner for a non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| wants to have supportive housing, and they just enter into a service contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| with a local service provider to provide those supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| So the last few things that I've been asked to cover are just some siting options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| or siting considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I would suggest that siting considerations for supportive housing are not that different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| than any other type of housing, whether it be affordable or market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| We always look at our existing housing options, and that means any number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| One, if you're going to build supportive housing, where are the vacant lots right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| Because those are really your opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| Where are there buildings that are underutilized that you could acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| and rehabilitate to supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Or are there options for adaptive reuse, taking an old church or a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| or a hospital or something like that, taking it from its former use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| and adapting it into a housing use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| You do always want to take a look at the concentration of existing affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| Many communities have established amongst their own elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| sort of a fair share provision, meaning it doesn't make sense for all of the affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| to be in this one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| It's not good for the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| It's not good for that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| So what is the fair share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| Where is the concentration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Always taking a look, are there broader community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| or neighborhood revitalization strategies that are taking place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| We're doing some work right now in the city of San Diego.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| They have this huge downtown redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| which I think you're doing a little bit of here along the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| And so in San Diego, they're doing this downtown development district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| which entitles any developer to get some tax breaks and other incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| Well, the city said that's great, and we want you to come in and build housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| but 10% of any of the housing that you build has to be supportive housing across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| If you want our assistance, you have to integrate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| And so that's really a citing consideration for supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| is taking advantage of those strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| Market and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Is there a demand for supportive housing in your community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| And what's the market for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| You know, it's my understanding that, at least in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| all you have to have is R2 zoning for supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| And, you know, if I found a vacant lot and it was zoned R2 theoretically and legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| I can build whatever's eligible under R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| And, you know, we always need to remind – I shouldn't say we always need to remind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| It's good to remind people sometimes that zoning decisions are governed by the Federal Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| And so if R2 means multifamily housing and you can't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| you shouldn't be told that you can't build supportive housing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| but you could build, like, market-rate affordable rental housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| because, at its core, it is multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| So the last slide, you know, we always look at probably the things you and I look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| when we decide where we want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| What's the proximity to any number of quality-of-life benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| For the supportive housing population, they probably want to be close to their service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| so they're not having to take a bus across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Again, you want to make the services as accessible and attractive to them as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| If they're not close to the services, that probably reduces their risk of participating in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| unless the service provider is going to deliver them on-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| You know, we all want to be close to grocery stores and schools and churches and community centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| We want to be close to work and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| So this really isn't that different than any other housing project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| or, again, the considerations you and I use when we decide where we want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| That's what I have to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| And with that, I think we have time where I can try to respond to some of your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| if you still have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:56| The question is, have I ever heard of a community that excludes this type of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| within a certain radius of other government-funded housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| I've heard of some communities trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| I've never heard of a community being successful doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| And a lot of that goes back to the federal fair housing law and how it intersects with zoning law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| and that if you have the zoning you need within that radius, then you can build that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:27| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:37| Have I ever heard of a community that had increased property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| at the same time they had a saturation of homeless services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:51| No, but I've never looked for that, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| For example, define homeless services for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3775)|
| 1:03:08| Food, clothing, housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| So what you're explaining to me is, like, drop-in services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| homeless individuals going to get a meal, take a shower, might sleep overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| but they're in and out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| So what you're describing, homeless services, traditional sort of drop-in services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| I could see how that may have a negative impact on property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| What I'll suggest to you, though, is that when you start using the supportive housing model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| the need for those types of homeless services theoretically should be greatly diminished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| because the individuals receiving the services at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| they're not necessarily dropping in and out and then walking from one to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| and then hanging out all day because they have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| They have an apartment to go back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| So if they need clothing, if they need a lunchbox or medical treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| they still may walk and get that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| but chances are they're probably going to walk right back home or walk to work, we hope, from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:23| So what about the other 80%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| You know, the other 80% is not chronic, theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| and so therefore shouldn't be, if they're accessing those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| it's for very limited periods of time until they're rehoused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| They are revolving. In the statements, they're revolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3883)|
| 1:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3938)|
| 1:05:49| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| I'm mindful of the comment about repeating comments and questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| and I'm not sure that I can even repeat that whole one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| I wonder if one of these microphones can be roving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| I guess, again, so that I can repeat it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| I'm just trying to summarize what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| I mean, I heard a comment something about a higher rate of incidences in subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:35| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| So the comment, there's information available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| There may be information available about incidences that take place in subsidized housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| not supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| So I, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| Let me just respond to that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| KCDC is a great case in point because they've realized at Kegel and three other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| their complex is that individuals are not succeeding in housing because they don't have the funds for support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| So part of the 10-year plan is about prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| We raised money to hire seven case managers to be spread out among four of their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| And those case managers, so they now have support there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| Those case managers are focused on the most at-risk residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| and they've been very successful helping stabilize that population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| population that was teetering on the brink of eviction and now succeeding in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| So, again, KCDC even realizes that for a lot of their population, support is critical to success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| So I'm going to pause for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| I'm going to pause for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4078)|

| 1:09:05| So let me repeat that one, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| just for the sake of an audience at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| That you think it all looks and sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| I got that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| That I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| And that if the units are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| the individuals receive the services that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| and they're properly case managed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| that you do see the benefits of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| even to the extent that it would come across as cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| That's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| And it's even better if it saves money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4174)|

| 1:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4253)|
| 1:11:11| So the first part of your question, in Dr. Inouye's study, he found that 48% of the homeless population came from somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:22| And your question is whether or not this type of housing might attract additional homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| Is it true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| Well, you know, let's put it this way. I think it's probably true that good quality affordable housing attracts people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:42| Period. Right. I mean, you know, it doesn't have to be affordable. Good quality housing attracts people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| Are there individuals who are living in the far reaches of Knox County or even bordering Knox County who might move here to take advantage of this housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:59| I don't know. And if they do, is it because of the housing? I wouldn't know. I have not seen that, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| Is it legal to exclude this housing to individuals who are not from Knox or Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:24| Yes and no. How would I say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| I mean, and I only say that because there's a whole host of federal laws that come into play in federal funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| And it's largely predicated on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| For example, if you use a Section 8 housing choice voucher, a local public housing authority can give a preference to individuals living or working in the city of Knoxville or Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:48| which could provide a preference to individuals going into supportive housing if they're going to use a housing choice voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| I mean, that's one little way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| On the flip side, depending on why you're saying no to them just because of where they come from, you could end up in trouble with fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| So that's why I say yes and no, because that would really be a case-by-case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4393)|
| 1:13:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| Well, so the comment was many of your homeless services are concentrated in one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| and so if you put a housing scattered site into the out-county area, you're basically creating the concentration of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| That's assuming that the service providers aren't going to the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| Oftentimes in scattered site supportive housing, service providers get in their car and they deliver services on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| So you don't have the concentration that you do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| You actually have the folks, the social workers who are not coming into work in the morning, getting their charges, and then they're gone all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| Why? Because, again, to be successful, the services have to be attractive and accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| And if you have someone who's living in out-county and you don't have a good public bus system to get them downtown to take advantage of the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| they're probably not going to take advantage of them and they're not going to be successful in their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| So it puts the responsibility on the service provider to engage that client where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:29| Okay, and I'll just take the last end of that comment, really, and repeat that, in that you really want it communicated and written that the responsibility is on the service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4553)|
| 1:16:03| There's a responsibility on the service provider to look beyond what is sort of here and now and the easiest, and, again, reaching people where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:13| Yeah, and, you know, my comment about the vacant land and vacant buildings can be a site in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| Not the only one, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| And, again, a lot of it depends on your strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| If your strategy is built primarily on the development of housing, okay, then that's probably going to be more of a consideration than if your plan suggested a lot of master leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:37| Because then you would go to where existing housing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| So it really depends on the strategy that you're going to use in your community to get the units to scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| And there isn't – most communities don't use just one, because building housing is a very long and expensive process, and you can master lease 100 units by the end of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:55| You know, so if you use a mix of strategies, you're probably going to have different siting considerations for each strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:40| First of all, I heard a compliment to the 10-year plan, and then there was a question – I have to take those where I can get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:49| There was a question about – you know, it's referred to as a 10-year plan, and sort of not only what happens with services funding during the 10 years, but what happens in year 11, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:59| I mean, that was sort of your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| A couple of different responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Generally, a 10-year plan was not really a mandate, but more of a charge from the federal government to communities and states around the country, saying put together a plan to end chronic homelessness within 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:14| So it doesn't imply that supportive housing is just around for 10 years, but it's saying put a plan into place where you could effectively house and end chronic homelessness in your community within 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:23| Some are much further along than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| Services funding – you may recall I referenced three budgets within supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| Your capital, which is your bricks and sticks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| Not necessarily easy to pull together, but probably the easiest of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| And once it's built, it's built, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| So your capital budget sort of goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Your operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| This is the cost of just running the building, and you have an operating budget for any apartment building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| And oftentimes, you know, your operating budget comes from rents and rent subsidies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| So as long as you have people in there, and they're paying, and they may have their housing choice voucher or other type of rental assistance, generally operating budget does okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:05| Honestly, you know, the services budget is by far the most challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| One, because it fluctuates depending on who you have in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| You know, if you have, you know, 50 people with really intensive service needs one year, your service budget could be through the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| And next year, you know, if they're low demand, your service budget could be way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| So there's not an easy answer, and I wish I could give you a model supportive service budget, but they are very, very different for each development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:35| Part of the challenge has also been created at the federal level in that many federal service sources are for short periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:45| It's three years or five years or a one-year renewal here and here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| And so it's a little bit of a patchwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| You know, all I can tell you is that we've been very successful in advocating for additional service money at the federal level every single year, and we've gotten it every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4791)|
| 1:20:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:11| Yeah, the question about, you know, looking at the economy and the safety nets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| It's not unusual, especially in this economy right now, that a lot of the supportive housing that's being developed is frontloading what we call a service reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:23| So it's taking – you get additional money up front to fund – it's sort of like a savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| So you're either funding an operating reserve or a service reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| And you're saying, you know what, I know in year 15 this building is going to start losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| I just know it because things – you know, taxes are going to go up, maintenance is going to go up, and, you know, the income of my tenants is probably flat if not down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:46| So on the front end, you frontload with reserve accounts, and then over time you're pulling out of your reserve account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| So that's a way that some developments are maintaining through operating and service reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:05| No, I am also – you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| The facilities would be through operating reserve, and the services would be through a service reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| And the service reserve – actually, those two reserve accounts are becoming more common of a requirement by lenders on the front end, like your housing finance agency here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:22| They may say, you know, we're willing to give X number of dollars of tax credits to this development or a forgivable loan or whatever resources they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:31| but we want to know that it's going to be supportive housing for 30 years or 50 years or whatever the requirement that they put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| Well, in order for them to have some level of assurance that it can continue to be quality supportive housing over that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:47| they very well may require you to have a service reserve on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| So there is some assurance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| And if you do have any state or federal sources in your development, chances are you're going to have onsite auditing at least once a year, if not more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4914)|
| 1:22:04| making sure that the facility meets – you know, the development meets standards, you're serving the population you said you were going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| and a whole host of other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:21| Participate in services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:43| The question is, have I seen supportive housing where participation in services is mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:55| That's pretty much what you're asking, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| The answer is yes, I have, although we do promote a model of voluntary services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| We have worked with providers around the country who say participation in services is mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| It's a condition of your lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| If you don't participate in these services that I deem necessary for you, then you're in violation of your lease and I'm going to evict you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| Where do they evict them to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Now, I will agree – but that's exactly what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| But let me finish responding to your question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| You are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| In supportive housing where participation in services is mandatory, there's a much higher rate of participation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| Because it's mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| And I just showed you that in some of the evaluations we've done, what was it, like 81% in health care, 80% in mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:47| I mean, I think those are pretty high, but it's certainly not 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| So you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Mandatory services, you will almost always have higher rates of participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| But what you will not have is the housing retention rates that we do in voluntary services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| People will participate in services while they're there, but they won't stay there for long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| And where do they generally go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| They go back into homelessness because they don't want to participate in your mandatory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| So supportive housing, you know, we – supportive housing is oftentimes met with challenges even by the service community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:19| Even though, you know, it's all about serving the same people because it puts – it somehow turns the table on some service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:27| because some service providers may be used to sitting in an office and having scheduled appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| and the client comes to them and, you know, it's a little bit of a revolving door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| and if someone misses an appointment, you know, so they miss it and then they've got the next one in the waiting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| And, you know, and that may work for some people and some providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| What supportive housing does, though, especially when you're not doing on-site services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| and you're having voluntary services, is it puts the responsibility on the service provider to come up with a service package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| that is, as I've said this a couple of times tonight, so attractive and so accessible that the resident wants to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| And does that mean the social worker drives out-county, you know, three times a week and knocks on the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| in hopes that one of the times you're actually going to answer? It very well may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| But that's, you know, that's where the service provider really has to buy into the whole concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| because it is a shift in philosophy for a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:34| To be successful, should there be a caseworker 24 hours a day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| Most supportive housing has a 24-hour property manager, either on-site or on-call, and a case manager on-site or on-call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:46| And this is really important when you're doing some of the master leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| So if I'm a private landlord and I've agreed to rent, you know, five apartments in my 25-unit building to a service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5150)|
| 1:26:01| and there's a resident that starts to decompose in there and they're causing all kinds of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| they're disturbing the peace, you know, they're making other people nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| I want to know who, yeah, decompose is a clinical term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| Sorry, not literally decompose, but, you know, they start to have issues, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| There are social workers in the room that need to decompose, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| But, you know, they start to have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| They're starting to cause problems and people are getting nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| There needs to be a 24-hour contact person for the property manager or for the neighbor or someone to call and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:39| there's some issues out here and that person needs to be there like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| because that's probably one of the fastest ways that you can lose support for supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5209)|
| 1:27:09| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:42| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| The comment was just she liked the fact that I'm suggesting responsibility both to the service provider and the resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:51| And remember, at its core, you know, these residents have leases with terms and conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| and they can be evicted for violating terms and conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| They don't pay their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| They're evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| You know, they disturb the peace one too many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| They destroy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| They, you know, do something that you or I would get evicted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| They will get evicted, and they should, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| All that we remember is in supportive housing, we separate the services from the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:42| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:55| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Yeah, the comment was, you know, she had a situation in her neighborhood where a question was asked of a service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:07| If you evict somebody, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| Do they walk out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| The response was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| I mean, it's basically their comment and question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| You know, I would like to think that there would be a network of service providers who buy into ending homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:23| especially through supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| and that there would not be a provider who would evict someone back into homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| because that only adds to their headache and it only exacerbates the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| What I would hope would happen is that the service provider, while they may do an eviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| at the same time is making a referral or a connection to another agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| who's able to provide whatever that individual needs at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| because something has happened in their life that they're not able to maintain housing any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| And so if that means they need to take a step back or two, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| Yeah, you know, and it's all about establishing those links within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:15| Do we have any experience in communities where neighborhoods have been part of a site selection process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| We have regularly, and it's really not unique to supportive housing even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| I've worked in a number of communities where there are neighborhood charrettes or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| neighborhood boards that have input on affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| or any other community development activity within their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| So I think that, yeah, yes, the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| There are lots of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| But, you know, a lot of that comes from the form of your government as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| in that either neighborhood advisory boards or neighborhood councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| they can be specific to a project or long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:15| Do I see greater successes when neighbors are brought in early on in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| Define success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Success of the project or of the tenants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| Of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| You know, I think that, you know, if I go back to sort of my neighborhood and housing planning days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| and true community development and an altruistic planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| it is almost always ideal to involve or at least educate and inform neighbors early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:51| Things will undoubtedly happen in our neighborhoods and in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| that we don't necessarily agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| And I think that one of the reasons why I think I'm here is because I'm here to respond to some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:06| and some questions, also to inform and to educate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| in hopes that maybe you might be a little bit more supportive of the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| a little bit more receptive of supportive housing as a concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| or maybe even welcome one into your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| You know, I'm not familiar with the neighborhood planning process here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:27| to know whether or not there are neighborhood advisory boards that are involved in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| I think it's probably safe to assume that supportive housing developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| that have neighborhood support are undoubtedly more successful because they're more welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| I mean, nobody likes a fight on either side, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| So I don't know that that answers your question because it's hard for me to respond very specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| because I'm not as familiar with your particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:18| Yeah, do we have any experience working with faith-based communities specifically around homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Oh, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| I mean, you know, if you look at many communities, especially the small ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| who's providing homeless services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| It's churches and the faith community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| I actually sit on the board of a faith-based nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| who operates both transitional and supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| Many of the roots of homeless services do go back to faith-based communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| and we've worked with a number of faith-based organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| that have become community development corporations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| because they're seeing a need for their constituency that's not being met by the open market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| or by a local government, and so they'll create their own small housing nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| or service provider and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| So certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| In fact, I would suggest that a lot, a lot of them, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| Let's say one more question, and then if you've got other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| I want to be sensitive to everybody's timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| We are in the Christmas season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| I bet everybody has a different place to be than this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| If you have other questions you want to address to me or address to Tim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| we'll hang around here, but let's have one more question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| and then after that we'll buy our applause so Tim will appreciate him being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5689)|
| 1:35:19| So I interpreted that as a comment, which I'll repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| that you represent COIN and Council of Involved Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| and you just wanted to go on record that you would like a seat at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| especially when issues around siting, not only affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:37| but specifically supportive housing or housing for the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| I said it out loud, so there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| And again, we'll hang around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/jointcitycountyhomelessforum081211part1?start=5752)|
