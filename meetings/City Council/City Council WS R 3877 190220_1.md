| 2:44:45| We think those are positive occurrences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| We applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| But we do want to talk about duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| You got my little note I sent out the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| Our real concern, we really woke up on this when we looked up one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9896)|
| 2:44:59| and we were all zoned RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| And we said, whoa, that's a big change from RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| We had some community meetings on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| and we have voluntarily agreed as a community that we will upzone from RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9906)|
| 2:45:13| which is really the RN-1 that we are now, to RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| So we're happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| We're very happy with going up to RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| But then you get caught in the bind of the duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| and the changes in what's happening with the duplex between RN-2 and RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9921)|
| 2:45:26| What we would think is that RN-2 and RN-3 ought to stay at the same 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| that it is right now in R1A, which is what all the neighborhoods currently are zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| and it's a special use permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| Currently, the way it's written, RN-2 kind of stays there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9937)|
| 2:45:40| except it's a smaller lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| RN-3 is a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| I'd like for you all to consider keeping RN-2 and RN-3 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9943)|
| 2:45:48| and special permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9948)|
| 2:45:51| But I would also add this, that 10,000 square feet is not the key number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| The key number is 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| That's the 50 by 150 lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| All of the inner city, not all, but a large number of lots throughout the inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| developed as part of the 19th, early 20th century are 7,500 square feet lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| Our concern is not vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| It's the houses that we've worked so hard to restore through the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9970)|
| 2:46:13| being re-subdivided again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| Now, honestly, the market's with us these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| That's not going to happen any time in the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| But things do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| And since I have a little time and I brought a chart with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| I want to show you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| We did this for our community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| I don't know how much you can see, but all the pinks are single families in 4th and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| Blues are duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| Greens are vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9996)|
| 2:46:37| And the yellows are multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| If you'd looked at this map 100 years ago in 1919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| it would have been all single family and green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10003)|
| 2:46:46| By 1945, long before zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| it would have been about a 50-50 because the Depression had occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| and wartime housing had occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| So it all changed by 1945.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| In 1965, by the time everything over here got torn up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| and blasted away for the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| it probably was 85 multifamily, 15% single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10024)|
| 2:47:08| And now, I've got seven seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| it's turned back into about an 80-20, 90-10 single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| So just keep that in mind as you're making the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| Okay, next is David Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10040)|
| 2:47:29| Please give your name and address and the timer is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10049)|
| 2:47:34| My name is David Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10054)|
| 2:47:36| I live at 2000 Tremont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| and I have law office at 1810 Merchant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| I'm also the Norwood Homeowners Association president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| My neighborhood is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10065)|
| 2:47:48| We've seen little tidbits all through the recode change the way we are expected to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10068)|
| 2:47:57| The whole purpose of the recode is to provide for enhanced taxable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10077)|
| 2:48:05| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10085)|
| 2:48:06| Let's translate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| You actually had it on one of your slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| A hierarchy of districts that scale up intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| I'll tell you how a lawyer translates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| That means that you're setting up the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| and this would be a specific concern of Ms. Perez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10102)|
| 2:48:28| that would qualify certain districts for increased development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10108)|
| 2:48:36| without adequate presumption against the development itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10116)|
| 2:48:44| Recode appears to have a changing in the burden of how projects are going to be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10124)|
| 2:48:56| I think that the total outcome of recode would result in the poorer neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10136)|
| 2:49:02| and I'm not in a rich neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| I'm in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| That's pure middle class, and they see things like this and know what it really means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10146)|
| 2:49:13| because we're the ones who get the apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| It's not over in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10160)|
| 2:49:21| We are aware that all of these changes are designed to increase the tax revenue of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10161)|
| 2:49:30| We have spent three hours, from my point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10170)|
| 2:49:36| in minutia that has little relevance to most of my residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10176)|
| 2:49:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10183)|
| 2:49:44| Instead of spending, we talked extensively about what a home office is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10184)|
| 2:49:50| Home office is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| It's whatever you want it to be as long as you're not bothering the guy next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10192)|
| 2:49:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| That simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10198)|
| 2:49:59| You don't have to know whether you're going to be talking on interspace communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10199)|
| 2:50:06| That entire frivolous communication wasted our time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10206)|
| 2:50:15| and this has been my first attendance at one of these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10215)|
| 2:50:21| and I'm not certain that I'm going to do a second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10223)|
| 2:50:24| Thank you, Mr. Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10224)|
| 2:50:25| Next is Cindy Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10225)|
| 2:50:33| Ms. Johnson, you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| Please give us your name and address, and, of course, the timer is on the screen above me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10234)|
| 2:50:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10241)|
| 2:50:42| Cindy Johnson, 8300 Alexander Cabot, and I'm in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10242)|
| 2:50:47| I've been listening, and I was more concerned about two or three things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| mixed use and home occupation offices and things that would come into the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10251)|
| 2:50:56| As I've listened tonight, I'm more concerned about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10256)|
| 2:51:02| I think, you know, looking at what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| and the past experience of 60 years of what we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| there was a lot of wisdom and a lot of work that went into that in these meetings over the last 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10269)|
| 2:51:15| a lot of wisdom there, and I hate to see us throw some of that out on one of the mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10275)|
| 2:51:21| I didn't realize until this last week that some of the things had been deleted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| and I think in doing this you're taking out some, oh, the human factor, I guess I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10287)|
| 2:51:34| but things that the people need because, you know, the taxpayers are paying for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10294)|
| 2:51:39| and we need to know sometimes if we're going to have the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10299)|
| 2:51:44| Andrew Roberto, you were so good about talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| We need some of those things clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| We need those terms in there about what would be in a home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| or mixed use in a neighborhood, you know, if it's the piano teacher or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10314)|
| 2:52:00| Yes, hopefully this document will be changing, and we can add and update, and no doubt it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10320)|
| 2:52:06| but we need those words for the common families and for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| We need a document that's more real and has that human factor, and I think that's been left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| I've also not heard a lot about the seasons of life here because the use has changed as we age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10335)|
| 2:52:23| and I've talked to a lot of young people because I thought we've talked about density so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10343)|
| 2:52:28| and I think two of the key words, and I was an editor for years, so saturation of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10348)|
| 2:52:34| and now I'm thinking it's oversaturation, which I don't even think the word exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| but oversaturation, and I think recode oversimplifies too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| and a lot of that has been taken out that over the years was put into the code that exists right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10362)|
| 2:52:50| and I think we need to go back and look at what was thrown out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| because there were two or three things deleted that I didn't realize had been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10373)|
| 2:52:57| and I think things have moved so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| Two years for a document like this, that's not very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10379)|
| 2:53:02| A lot of families are just now hearing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10382)|
| 2:53:05| Some of the neighborhood organizations, it sounded like from some of the other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| they were just realizing that, so I think we need to look at some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10389)|
| 2:53:14| and I'm thinking don't urbanize the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| There are pieces of property that needed along the corridors downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10397)|
| 2:53:21| There have been some great things done, but not every neighborhood wants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10401)|
| 2:53:25| Some people, and a lot of the young families I'm talking to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| now that they have two or three children, they want the land also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10408)|
| 2:53:32| and very similar to what we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| It's not five houses on just one little acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10415)|
| 2:53:39| That's too saturated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| Quality of life, just think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| Thank you very much for your remarks, Ms. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| Next is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10426)|
| 2:53:48| Is Joyce still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Oh, yes, there she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10430)|
| 2:53:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10436)|
| 2:53:57| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| I'm going to talk about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| I thought I was only going to talk about one, but now I'm going to talk about two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| The first one is neighborhood non-residential reuse that Councilmember Roberto brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10445)|
| 2:54:13| which is Section 919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10453)|
| 2:54:17| At the bottom it says signs are limited to those allowed in the CN District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10457)|
| 2:54:23| Well, if you look at the section on signs and you look at commercial signs, F1325,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10463)|
| 2:54:32| I don't believe that neighborhood signs are broken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10472)|
| 2:54:36| Sign height and sign size are dependent upon road classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10476)|
| 2:54:42| So that means that there can be signs that are anywhere as tall as from 10 feet to 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10482)|
| 2:54:49| And I don't think that that's what we want in the middle of our residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10489)|
| 2:54:53| So I would like to propose that that particular use has its own signage designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10493)|
| 2:55:01| and that that should be based on the office district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| which only allows six-foot monument signs that are 32 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10504)|
| 2:55:10| And for the wall signs or the attached signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10510)|
| 2:55:13| they're allowed five percent of the square footage of the primary facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10513)|
| 2:55:18| That seems to me to be appropriate if this is in the middle of a residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10518)|
| 2:55:23| as opposed to a possible 35-foot tall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| Okay, that's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| Number two, I want to talk about architectural design standards for single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10528)|
| 2:55:35| And in earlier drafts of RECO, there were minimal standards included for single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10535)|
| 2:55:43| Somewhere along the way, these were deleted, and we would like to see some standards put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10543)|
| 2:55:50| Design standards are very common in zoning codes of other cities I've been looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10550)|
| 2:55:56| They encourage thoughtful planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| They preserve community character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| They ensure that homes are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| and they preserve, protect, and enhance the city's historical, architectural, and aesthetic resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10564)|
| 2:56:11| And I'm going to plagiarize from Gerald right now because I heard him say this at a meeting once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10571)|
| 2:56:16| Design standards are what make people proud to call their house a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| and I think that everybody deserves to be proud to call their house a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10580)|
| 2:56:26| And the second point on that is that we would like to see the review and approval of design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10586)|
| 2:56:34| come under the purview of Gerald's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| They are professional planners, and I think that they are in the best position to carry this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10597)|
| 2:56:43| So I'm not going to go through the standards that Scenic Knoxville is supporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| but I will send them all to you so you'll know what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| Thank you, Ms. Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10612)|
| 2:56:53| Next is Michael Stenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10613)|
| 2:57:03| Well, I guess we're running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| There's been a few things that have been on my mind since I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| If you would please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| 1401 Cuesta Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10630)|
| 2:57:14| Since I actually found out about this and I actually showed up for the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| there's been several things that I've been pondering within my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10638)|
| 2:57:22| First and foremost, I was wanting to understand why is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10642)|
| 2:57:26| it started out with an $11,000 update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| That's simple, short, sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10651)|
| 2:57:32| Well, we decided that we needed a complete rewrite on all of our laws, on all of our codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10652)|
| 2:57:38| And then I actually started doing a little bit more research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| And now are you two gentlemen both with Cameros?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10661)|
| 2:57:45| And there was no $11,000 start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| It was always a complete rewrite from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| It was always $300,000, which is the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| Well, that was for the entire budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| For Cameros, it was supposed to be $11,000 based on my initial understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10677)|
| 2:58:02| Okay, I could be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| But now with Cameros, what I'm trying to understand is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| and I do understand that when it comes down to sustainability with city development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10689)|
| 2:58:14| these are goals that many of those things I also agree with as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10694)|
| 2:58:19| And apparently there's been a guide of rules that have already been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10699)|
| 2:58:25| And with that being the case, I was trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| if you are operating in conformity with the goals of the 2030 Agenda proposed by the United Nations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10708)|
| 2:58:36| I've never read the 2030 Agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| I think that belongs to some group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| As a professional planner for years, I've never read it, so I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10720)|
| 2:58:44| Well, it's really interesting that no one really knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| because I'm going to entertain the group here, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| Sir, if you could confine your remarks to recode, it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| In what year did the United States agree to the goals of the United Nations Agenda 2030?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10737)|
| 2:59:07| Now it's not even coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| Now I look like, oh, this is horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| In what year did the United States agree to the goals of Agenda 2030?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10751)|
| 2:59:19| According to the United Nations, on 1 January 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10763)|
| 2:59:28| adopted by world leaders in September 2015 at an historic UN summit officially came into force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10768)|
| 2:59:35| This is actually off of the United Nations' own website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10775)|
| 2:59:40| So, now with this being the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| because I actually started looking coast to coast throughout the entire United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10782)|
| 2:59:46| we actually have Burlington County, Camden County, Clouster County, Mercer County for New Jersey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10786)|
| 2:59:53| Providence, Rhode Island, Davenport, Iowa, Rome, New York, Metis, Illinois, Syracuse, New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10793)|
| 2:59:58| Marion, Pennsylvania, Shreveport, Louisiana, Portland, Oregon, Minnesota, Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| Mr. Stinson, your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| I understand, but at this point in time, these codes were actually done in Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| But the codes were actually done in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| Thank you for your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| I understand, but I feel that the people behind me have a right to understand this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10818)|
| 3:00:23| Then they'll be willing to talk to you later, but thank you for your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| Well, with the remarks, I want to address how much money and how much...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10826)|
| 3:00:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10832)|
| 3:00:33| When it comes down to the value of the American dollar, what's happening in the United States over in Nashville...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| This is not about recon, so if you want to talk to me personally afterwards, you're welcome to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10837)|
| 3:00:42| Because what I'm trying to find out with the audience is an audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10842)|
| 3:00:46| Is there any guarantee that what's happening in Austin, Texas and Nashville, Tennessee will not happen here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10846)|
| 3:00:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10852)|
| 3:00:53| Sir, you are our last speaker, and we are going to adjourn in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10853)|
| 3:00:57| I did want to thank everybody for coming this evening and making their remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10857)|
| 3:01:01| I especially want to thank Mr. Green and Mr. Ahrens for their patience and their hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10861)|
| 3:01:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10867)|
| 3:01:08| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190220?start=10868)|
