| 0:05:59| Very good. Mr. Burleson, it appears that all of our partners are going to have to do some follow-up, but otherwise I'd like to entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=359)|
| 0:06:09| I'd like to make a motion to approve with all the pendings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| He's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Yeah, he's okay. Who was the second? I'm sorry. All right. The motion was made by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| I see a red light on Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you, Chairman. I just wanted to double check on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| It says for on and off premises, and you said just for on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| So I just wanted to clarify that we have the right thing on our application for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=397)|
| 0:06:46| We typically put on and off because every now and then we do caterings for nonprofits around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| If it ends up being an on-premise only, that is quite fine with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Well, no, I was just questioning. We just need to make sure we have the correct information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| It's whatever you want to apply for. It's just on our sheet it says on premises, but your application says on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| So you're applying for on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| That would be best if possible, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| That's fine with me. We just need to make sure we have the right information on there because you said on when our law director asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| So we just need to clarify and make sure what you want and we have the right information on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| I will restate the motion for Commissioner Anders just so we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| You made the motion to approve, and that was to approve as his application states for on or off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Excuse me, on and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Yes, with the pendings involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| With the pendings involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| So we've restated the motion, so it should be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=476)|

| 0:07:59| I need to see you a minute before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Good luck, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Thank you for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| One point I might add, Randy had mentioned one reason for the off premise was the work that he does for non-profits in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=485)|
| 0:08:15| I've seen it across the board, and it's not just for non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| It's for so many of the schools in our community, a lot of the public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| He's doing the dinner for the West football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| He's doing a lot of stuff to help so many non-profits and the schools, and I know he gets hit up for this kind of stuff all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| What do you say every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| There's always an email or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Well, I just want to thank you because I've seen it firsthand that besides running a good business, you really work hard to give back to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=515)|
| 0:08:45| and we're really grateful to see business owners like you, what you do, and also we wish you all the success in the world as you continue to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=525)|

| 0:11:07| So we do have some pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| I'm seeing on my notes that we've got to make sure that you've received the business license from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| a certificate of registration, and surrender the beer license from the past one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=675)|

| 0:12:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| The clerk's office is saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| It does need to be surrendered before we can write the new one, but it does not have to be within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=764)|

| 0:14:24| Ebenezer United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| Some of you on commission actually attended the groundbreaking ceremony for their new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| sanctuary, I guess about two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| And then many of you, more of the current commissioners, attended actually the dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| of that new sanctuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| And one thing I would like to just mention, too, that Ebenezer United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| like many of the churches in our community, have done a great job of community outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| and allowing citizens and neighborhoods to have community meetings in their sanctuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| So we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Pastor Robbins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=905)|

| 0:15:45| us to think and express our views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| God, I pray for each of these leaders, that by your wisdom they may be led, that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=952)|
| 0:16:03| will have beyond knowledge but discerning wisdom as they listen carefully for truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=963)|
| 0:16:14| as they piece together futures and plans that affect our lives and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=974)|
| 0:16:27| And God, as you encourage us in James chapter 1, that we might lead by being quick to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=987)|
| 0:16:39| and slow to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=999)|

| 0:18:49| He's easy to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| And we have Sherry Witt here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| I saw her momentarily in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1134)|

| 0:18:59| Is Glenn still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| All right, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Glenn, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Glenn, I spoke with the mayor earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1144)|

| 0:19:12| So our mayor is going to be leaving us probably after about 30 or 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| But I know it's an important meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| And I thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1157)|

| 0:19:23| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| So moving now into public forum, I have one member of the public who has registered to speak with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1164)|
| 0:19:34| And I'd like to ask Tracy Clough, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, Tracy, I hope so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| if you'd please step forward and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| And you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| And thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Yes, my name's Tracy Clough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| I live at 457 Tammie Drive, Apartment 9, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| And I'd like to speak a few moments tonight on HUSH currency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| I've been before the commission several times throughout the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| And with five minutes to speak and the complexity of my situation, I can't get it exhausted within that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1210)|
| 0:20:19| So what happens is I have to come back and recycle over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| And I asked to meet with my commissioner, Charles Bussler, a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| And what it is is I have been framed five times since 1984| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1230)|
| 0:20:41| by the six judicial Knox County Police and Sheriff's Department and police departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1241)|
| 0:20:49| And I've sued them four times, and all my lawsuits have been thrown out and dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| And the law departments on each time have destroyed, sabotaged, and tampered with evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| In 1984, the city law department, Mr. Hoffelberg, they deleted a 9-1-1 tape then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| and they brought the sheriff's department into that issue saying that I had stole a gun from Fox and Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| and grabbed the receipt and ran out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| And then the latest thing that happened in 2010, my homeland, heritage, birthright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1283)|
| 0:21:32| and inheritance of my state my father had left me was illegal and unlawfully taken by the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1292)|
| 0:21:40| And I notified them not to serve the eviction on that, and I notified the judge on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| and none of my constitutional rights were honored, including the right to a trial in my jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| And the sheriff didn't have to serve the eviction, but he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| The courts, and another thing that happened as far as deleting evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| I had 23 court tapes deleted in 1998 when I was falsely charged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| and I had sued an attorney, Jeff Witt, who was also, I didn't know it, but he was a city judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| Before he could get the lawsuit, the court clerk's office called him and told him about it before it was even served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| So what we have in Knox County, especially in the Sixth Judicial Circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| is we have a favor bank judge's hand upon the scale with the law department, the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1350)|
| 0:22:39| and the judges, the Sixth Judicial Circuit, and they have the hush money all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| The hush money that they give you is you complain about the deleted tapes, which I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| I came up here to get a warrant for tampering with evidence, and I got beat up and arrested and charged with four charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| derailing some of my lawsuits and actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| And guess what happened to the video feed with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| The public building authority and sheriff's department deleted that, and they lied on the warrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| even replacing one of the deputies with a sergeant who wasn't even on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| And I would like for this mayor and this commission to engage with me and talk to me about forming a mayor's commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1401)|
| 0:23:33| on corruption and unlawful government dishonesty in the Sixth Judicial Circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| It involves county entities. It involves state entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| And it's a shame when we fly an American flag in here and I go to court and subpoena the sheriff, the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1425)|
| 0:23:57| those records and everything in my defense and my right to a compulsory process to call witnesses on my behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1437)|
| 0:24:08| because I was dishonored and they didn't show, and I was framed and railroaded and was transported across land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1448)|
| 0:24:17| 13 times to be tried for pretended offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| And it's just the trauma and what I went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1461)|
| 0:24:30| I have to receive counseling for all the trauma that I've been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| And there's a building ban against me because of the eviction thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| Some issues arose there, and my character has been besmirched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1480)|
| 0:24:49| I've been disenfranchised from my country, and these are false charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| These are assault on police officers. I've never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| Thank you for sharing, but that's five minutes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1501)|

| 0:27:02| She was voted to be our Registrar of Deeds, I believe, for at least ten years, weren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=1622)|

| 0:35:13| And 6 and 7, which we've just added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2113)|
| 0:35:21| I make a motion to defer those items that are deferred, withdraw the items withdrawn, and set the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2121)|

| 0:36:05| The motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders and has been seconded by Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Before we pass this, I'd like to call on Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| I'd like to note that there were some additional drawings that set aside the closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| A bit different than in the packet we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Just want to make sure everybody's aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Is that a significant change from one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2188)|

| 0:36:36| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2196)|

| 0:36:49| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| Don't we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| I believe we need a motion to have discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| I know that Mr. Caldwell, you may want to be prepared to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| I'll make a motion we approve with the removal of the BMX line item, I think, which was number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2223)|
| 0:37:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| A motion to approve without the BMX line has been made by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| It was seconded, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| I first heard Commissioner Schoonmaker on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| We can now begin discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Mr. Caldwell, would you like to go ahead and take the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2246)|

| 0:37:40| I'm just here to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| You've got the items in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| We did pull the line item for BMX, and I think we also had asked to pull page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| which was an internal service fund that doesn't require commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| So other than that, I think we sent out this week a listing of what those transfers were by page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2275)|
| 0:38:03| So if you have any type of questions, we'll try to answer those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Otherwise, I think they're just ready to be approved so we can continue to close out the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| Are there any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=2293)|

| 0:52:37| of Zoning and Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Okay, before we move into the discussion on this one, shortly before we brought this vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3159)|
| 0:52:47| up, Commissioner Schoonmaker shared with me that at this time there is not an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| for District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| We'll probably have one by the next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| So, after consulting with the Law Director, what I'd like to propose would be a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| motion from the floor where we take the first part of it that is considering appointing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| reappointing District 5, pull that out of this resolution and have the District 5 appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| carried over to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3197)|

| 0:53:24| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| It's got to be a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| It can't be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| You've got to have a motion to have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| So, it's got to be a motion just to remove District 5 and then approve the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3218)|

| 0:53:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| ...by Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Now, before we vote, I would like to get a substitute motion to sort it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| Do we not need a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Just vote to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| That motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| I will restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| The motion will be basically to consideration of a resolution, the Commission of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| reappointing David Harden, District 7, and reappointing Patricia Williams, District 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| James Cochran, District 3, and Robert A. Thompson, District 9, to the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3254)|
| 0:54:21| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Mr. Chairman, I just want to just take a moment to say that I appreciate the other members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| that are re-upping again to be able to serve our community on the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| because this is one of the most important bodies that we have jurisdiction over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| and I appreciate their service that they want to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| And for the general public, anyone who may be at home watching this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| the Board of Zoning Appeals is the appellate body for some matters that may come before Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3295)|
| 0:55:03| So, as an example, if a use on review had gone to Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| and one of the parties did not agree with their decision, it would have been appealed to that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| We need to make another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| Yes, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| The motion was to remove the fifth. Now we need to vote on the motion to elect the remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| He just made a motion to approve those that had been filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| And he left out the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Mr. Law Director, I read the motion to restate it where all I said was I read the whole motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| and just did not say anything about the fifth district appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| I thought the original motion was to remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Okay, thank you. So we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| So, anyhow, yes, thank you to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| That is a very important board that serves as the appellate body for many of our county zoning levers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| Before we move on, I wanted to thank and recognize Farragut Vice Mayor Louise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3366)|

| 0:57:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3467)|

| 0:57:49| Other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Item number 49 is discussion item regarding the slope protection in new subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| And before we move on to that important item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| I just wanted to be clear for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| As we look at our agenda, we have no other ordinances on first or second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| I also want to find out if there are anyone else in the audience who would like to speak to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| Is there any other public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| Mr. Chairman, as we get into this discussion, the public may be moving away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3499)|
| 0:58:30| I'd like to take another moment of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| Earlier this afternoon in the Carter community, long-awaited circumstance has been fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3513)|
| 0:58:43| It takes someone with a relatively long memory, Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3523)|
| 0:58:52| and myself realized that there were a couple of convenience centers in Knox County that needed repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3532)|
| 0:59:03| And it was through the actions in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| actually one low-utilized convenience center was traded for real estate in Commissioner Anders' area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3548)|
| 0:59:18| A convenience center was constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| The pause at Carter was the request for proposals to provide real estate was not successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3562)|
| 0:59:31| was re-advertised a second time and not successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| and then entered into constructing the convenience center that is ribbon-cutting this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3574)|
| 0:59:44| I appreciate, on behalf of the citizens of the Carter community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| Knox County making the efforts to get us into the recycling business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| into a business that helps defray the cost of disposing of waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| and also contribute back to the general fund of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| It's a day that has been long-awaited, and I thank Knox County on behalf of those citizens for its completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3607)|
| 1:00:16| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Commissioner Bussler, I know that you proposed our next topic for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| which is regarding slope protection in new subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| The floor is yours, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| What I'd like to do, since I don't see Mr. Green here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| I would like to bring this in here to discuss some issues after we do zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| when we do zonings in the process of getting a development going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| So if we could, could we move this into the zoning portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| so Mr. Green can be here and answer some questions for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| So we'll plan on moving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| This is not something that needs to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| We'll just talk about that at zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| I'm going to ask one more time to see if there's any other folks from the public who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| Chris got up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| So, yeah, he may be leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| He may be leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| So seeing none, this actually concludes our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| Are there any announcements here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| I'd just like to announce that the Joint Education Committee has secured a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3686)|

| 1:01:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3712)|

| 1:01:59| on that Monday through that week for the five members who are in the Legislative Affairs Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3719)|

| 1:02:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3731)|

| 1:02:16| I know we've got some meetings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3736)|

| 1:03:27| but Ag Day is a great way if you ever want to learn about what the University of Tennessee is doing to help agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| in our whole state and the jobs and the economic impact it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3812)|

| 1:05:17| This name change is a result of a realignment of Schaefer Road and the removal of Iron Gate Road from the street inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=3917)|

| 1:07:04| that warrant the reconsideration of the original Sector Plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| and that the new designation would enable zoning that would permit appropriate development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4028)|

| 1:08:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 11-3 to recommend C.A. General Business and O.A. Office Park zoning for the 4.2-acre tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4135)|
| 1:09:05| finding that that zoning would allow appropriate development of property located at an intersection that generated a great deal of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4145)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4153)|

| 1:09:26| I am here on behalf of the applicant, Mr. Craig Allen, and he is here also with his neighbors in support of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4174)|

| 1:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4178)|

| 1:09:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| First, I'd just like to make a quick statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| I thought this was a great opportunity where the developer, Mr. Allen, presented his project in advance to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4187)|
| 1:09:55| and the community was able to get with him and modify it slightly and be able to go forward with it to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve the rezoning to C.A. General Business and O.A. Office Park based on the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4202)|
| 1:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| And there's a second by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Commissioner Skinmaker has made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| It has been seconded by Commissioner Anders as it has been recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Seeing none, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4237)|

| 1:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Next one, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Item 53 is 8-A-18-RC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| It's a request of S&E Properties, Eric Mosley, for rezoning from A Agricultural to P.R. Planned Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| at a density of up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Property is located south side of Westland Drive, east of Gothic Manor Way in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4262)|
| 1:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| I'm here on behalf of Mr. Mosley and S&E Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Mr. Green, if you could provide a summary, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 13-0-1 on consent to recommend approval of the planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| at a density of up to five dwelling units per acre for the 0.357 acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| The Commission found that the P.R. zoning would allow development consistent with the surrounding land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| and development in the area, and this is a very small tract that will be added to a portion of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| that has been zoned P.R. since 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Thank you for that summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Yes, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| I'm ready to make a motion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| And the interesting thing, too, is this portion of property is only less than a third of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| and it's just to attach it to the larger portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| so that's why I think it rolled right through with consent because nobody in the community had any objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve the P.R. planned residential zoning at a density of up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4343)|
| 1:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4356)|

| 1:12:38| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| This motion was made by Commissioner Schoonmaker and seconded by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Item number 54 is 8-C-18-RC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| It's a request of Deborah G. Daugherty for rezoning from a agricultural slash T.O. technology overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| and P.R. planned residential slash T.O. technology overlay at up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| to P.R. planned residential T.O. technology overlay at up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| Property located southeast side of Lovell Road northeast of Cape Brittany Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4401)|
| 1:13:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| Once again, I promote you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| Mr. Green, would you please provide a summary of this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended 8-6 that the County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| P.R. slash T.O. technology overlay zoning at a density of up to seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| While the requested zoning would be compatible with the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| and is a logical extension of that sector plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| the Commission found that the density of seven units an acre would be more compatible with the built character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| The Commission and staff do feel that regardless of the staff's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| landscaping and screening are important and that the peripheral setback should be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| And I see a light on from both Commissioner Smith and I know you as the applicant would probably like to address Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| I'm going to go ahead and let you state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| and then I'm going to call on Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Josh Sanderson with Smithville Homes at 4909 Ball Road representing Smithville and Deborah Daughtry on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Although I've been assured by the law department that this is a conflict that if I announce I can vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| the applicant, Debbie, is my cousin, so I'm going to recuse myself just out of an abundance of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you for that transparency, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Would the applicant like to address the board, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| And, Commissioners, thank you all for your service and time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| I'll send you all the brief packet on Friday and hopefully you all had a few minutes to look over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| Nothing major I want to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| I just pointed out that it was consistent with the surrounding zonings, consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| We can achieve a desirable townhome development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| and we can meet all the Knox County subdivision regulations that will be put upon us during the planning and the concept design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4538)|
| 1:15:51| One thing that was a little bit disheartening that I'd go into a little bit, but the vote was 8-6 at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| and, again, it was eight city commissioners versus six county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| And what's disheartening about it is that maybe not weekly, but at least biweekly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| city councilmen or city officials or representatives of the city are in Smithville Homes office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| or on the phone with my boss or on the phone with me trying to get us to do a development inside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| and get maximum capacity and get a desirable townhome or desirable single family or even mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4583)|
| 1:16:33| And it's just disheartening that this one, if this was two miles down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| I'm assuming it would have been a unanimous in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| The other thing I'm looking at, when staff made the recommendation that the land is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| and consistent with surrounding zonings but not consistent with the way the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| or the surrounding developments were built out, a little confusing on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Being a bird dog, for the lack of better words, looking at land all day, every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| and I look, say I look in East Knox County or I look in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| when I pull up KGIS and I click that little zoning button to the side and I see five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| ten units an acre, whatever it is, I don't go on to that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| And I'm not saying maybe I should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| I don't go on that development and start adding up and see what it actually built out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| So when I looked at this sector map and saw the 12 behind it that was us, the 10 to the west that was Devonshire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| and then 10 across the street of Lovell Road, I made the assumption that, you know, this is a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| Again, I'm here for any comments, questions, or any more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| I'll save the rest of the time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Thank you, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| I guess, Mr. Green, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Well, first, Josh, is the seven that was approved by MPC, is that the number that you're able to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| I mean, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| The 12 units per acre giving 18 total townhomes was the desirable, what we requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| The seven was the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Let's talk about that a little bit, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| The recommendation by the staff, if you go on, or I don't know where the comment came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4693)|
| 1:18:20| but if you go on where something's built out at, I mean, if you do that for everybody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4700)|
| 1:18:28| somebody builds at 12 or they get 12 and they build at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| Well, the next guy only gets 8 because this guy built at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| So the next guy, what if he builds at 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| The next guy gets 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| What's the thought process behind that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| You're lowering the density in highest and best use for one guy versus the next guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| I'd like to start by correcting Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| There were two county appointees who voted against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| and it's interesting that just last week I had lunch with Chair Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| and one of my comments was that staff needed to quit looking so much at the built character of an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| and quit looking at the past and start looking more towards the future of what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| And so we're making some changes at MPC, continuing to evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| to address the changing conditions in Knox County and the need to accommodate more residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4756)|
| 1:19:25| And so I'm in a challenging place here because, you know, we're making that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| I have to defend the commission's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| but I would say that I think you have made a good point that we need to start looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| instead of behind to look at what we can accommodate instead of what the past development trend has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| So what is the difference on this piece of property that changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4785)|
| 1:19:53| Why would you not allow me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Because, I mean, they've done the same thing on West Emory behind the old Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| They had a couple of lots there, and they built a couple of townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| They're well kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| They look nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| They've got some over on Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Why are we punishing them for building a marketable unit when we need more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| I mean, obviously everybody knows there's a lack of inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| so why has the MPC staff decided they're going to punish people for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| I think that's a lack of imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| Logically, how did we get from 12 to 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| We're looking at doing an average of the surrounding existing development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| and looking at that as opposed to, again, looking at what was done instead of what could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4838)|
| 1:20:46| And the information that Mr. Sanderson provided today I thought was good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| and maybe it's a lack of imagination on the staff's part that we didn't feel that the 12 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| could be accommodated on this property and meet the peripheral setbacks and landscaping and the parking demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| He would have to go through that TPO or TTCDA through that site plan approval, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4865)|
| 1:21:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| So if he got, say, 10 but can only fit 10 or 8 with the setbacks, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| I think we've punished him unnecessarily on this zoning because right beside him is 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4881)|
| 1:21:29| their same development has up to 12 and they built houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| I don't understand the staff's thought process in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| Again, we're reevaluating that and looking at that differently with some staff changes that we have recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| We're taking, I guess, a more forward-looking approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| I'm going to make a motion to recommend it up to 10 units instead of the 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Okay, a motion has been made by Commissioner Anders to take this request from 7 units an acre up to 10 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4920)|
| 1:22:13| That is what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4933)|

| 1:22:21| I would also ask the applicant if you'd like to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| We accept the 10 units an acre if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=4945)|

| 1:25:00| What about the email regarding TDEC and the status of the crayfish that are located on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5100)|
| 1:25:10| Have we looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| We'd have to look at that and work with TDEC on that because that is their jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5113)|

| 1:27:12| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5234)|

| 1:27:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| This is a zoning appeal, 8-E-18-RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| appealed by Scott Davis, applicant of MPC decision to deny the request to increase the PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| from five dwelling units per acre to 14 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5252)|

| 1:27:45| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| All right, Mr. Green, could you provide a summary of this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, the Planning Commission voted 8-5 to deny the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| on increasing the PR zoning from five dwelling units per acre to 14 dwelling units per acre for this tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5280)|
| 1:28:07| That would be consistent with the sector plan designation recommendation for denial of the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| And the Commission found that there were no changes which would warrant a change in the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| Okay, very good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| What I'd like to do, I want to make sure that both parties know that you will get equal time to talk to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| So I'm going to call on the applicant first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| I'm going to ask the clerks to set a timer just so that we make sure it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| Go ahead and move that up to ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I want to make sure nobody gets short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| Okay, thanks, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| And go ahead, Mr. Davis, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5325)|

| 1:28:55| I hope you guys are enjoying yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| And I will defer to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| All right, Mr. Davis defers to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| My name is Wayne Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| I'm an attorney at Hodges, Dowdy, and Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| I'm here representing the Westland West Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| It's an association of homeowners, businesses, and subdivisions that extend from Ebenezer Road to North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5355)|
| 1:29:25| We've been in place since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| And so that means we were here originally in 1998 when a set of restrictive covenants was placed on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| and then in 1999 when your applicant and still the owner of the property, Oliver Smith Trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5377)|
| 1:29:44| came and asked for an increase in density on this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| Now, what we're doing is what the application is for is to take and increase what was given back in 1999,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5391)|
| 1:29:59| which was one to five dwelling units per acre on this apartment property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| That's the property on which he took all of the one to five and developed apartments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5404)|
| 1:30:13| And today he's asking for an increase to, I think, one to 14 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5413)|
| 1:30:26| which would give an increase on the total property of between 520 to 637 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5426)|
| 1:30:38| That's the improper way to go about doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| The redesignation of this particular site for high density would conflict with the Southwest Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5442)|
| 1:30:52| which says this should be low density at one to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| and potential overdevelopment of the remaining PR zoned area in this tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| And the current zoning and density are consistent with the current sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| which was amended in 2016 to call this for low density residential at one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| So the total additional units that could be proposed now is 238.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| If this rezoning is approved, that number increases to 355.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| The development plan for the apartments was approved by MPC in 1999 with the expectation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| and I think it's in the file, the expectation that the remaining acreage would be limited to the number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| still available at the current density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| I was here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| We didn't oppose it at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| It's one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| It has been that way, and it shouldn't increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| When 282 units were approved on the 19-acre apartment site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| it had the expectation in the recommendation from MPC in this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| that the remaining PR zoned acreage would be developed at a much lower density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| and that's the intent of the PR zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| Approval of this density increase is in conflict with the intent of the 1999 approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| but also with the 2016 amendment to the Southwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| So what we're asking is that you deny the sector plan designation request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5542)|
| 1:32:30| and deny the request to increase the PR zoning from five dwelling units to 14 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| Mr. Jack Woodall, who's on the board, would like to take the rest of the time, and I defer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| Jack Woodall, 9520 Westland Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| I, too, was here in 1999 when this plan and zoning was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5575)|
| 1:33:04| and the MPC recommendation from that period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| really talks about the fact that the apartments were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| and that there was a plan in place that the community was consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| that would result in development of that property in a way that was consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| with the rest of the development around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| Pellissippi Parkway and Westland Drive is a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| and not a large commercial interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| and the entire development around this area is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| The fact that we have this apartment complex on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| is part of that development idea for the way that Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5634)|
| 1:34:01| and Pellissippi Parkway will develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| We're here now with essentially what amounts to be a subterfuge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5644)|
| 1:34:13| for rezoning these apartments that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| What it amounts to is that the rest of this is somehow related to the rest of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| and frankly, the whole concept of trying to rezone something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| that you don't intend to do anything with as part of a redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| simply creates an enormous amount of confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| and it was that confusion that is part of the problem with this whole idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5681)|
| 1:34:50| We think that this rezoning is a subterfuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| It simply should be rejected, and if there's something else that needs to be done with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| it can be done, or it can be suggested anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| but that can be dealt with directly and not with a subterfuge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| and we ask that you deny the rezoning request in this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| All right. Thank you, Mr. Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| Is there any other statements from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Okay. I'll ask for the applicant to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| I also was here in 1997 when this was originally zoned, sitting in the seats where you're all sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| A lot's changed in this area since 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| Yeah, 1997 was when it was originally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| I'd like to offer a compromise, and I understand this is pretty confusing for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| because it's a little bit unusual in this particular circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| and so what I would like to help eliminate some of the confusion that relates to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| a transfer of densities from one parcel to the other in planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| This parcel was originally 113 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| It has now been divided into 29 different parcels with 25 different owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| So to go back and put the genie back in the bottle and recreate that all over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| it would be very difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| So to help eliminate or alleviate some of their concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| it may be more beneficial to specifically designate zonings on each of the remaining parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5777)|
| 1:36:24| as well as the apartment complex as developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| So in all due respect to the commission, if it's possible to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| and I would yield to Mr. Sanders and Mr. Green if this is a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| but if county commission could remand this back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| whereby MPC could designate 4.5 units per acre on the undeveloped portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5803)|
| 1:36:52| which is presently zoned five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| And I'm going to repeat what I said because it is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Take the undeveloped portion of the property, send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| putting a density of four dwelling units per acre, 4.5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| on the remaining undeveloped portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| which is now currently zoned at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| And then taking the apartment piece and giving it its own zoning as it was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| thereby nobody can transfer density or transfer units from one piece of property to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5842)|
| 1:37:29| thus hopefully eliminating or alleviating the concern of transferring that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| And so it may require, I don't know, I'd have to yield again to Mr. Sanders and Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| but it could possibly require a sector plan amendment specifically to the apartment piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5861)|
| 1:37:49| as it's developed as high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| We also have to understand and remember that this was originally approved for 583 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| There's a church on the property that covers 27.75 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| That church, and I'm not sure exactly why or how this happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| but the church takes away 138 of the original units that could have been put on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5886)|
| 1:38:15| As a developer, if I was developing a 200-acre site and I wanted to set aside 50 acres for a church or a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5895)|
| 1:38:24| I'd be penalized for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| I'm not sure why MPC pulls out acreage for a church or a school for density purposes, but they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| And in this particular case, 27.75 acres are set aside and designated for a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| thereby eliminating 138 of the original units that could have been developed on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| So in all due respect to the commission, if the commission is so willing to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| and with maybe advice from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Green, that this be remanded back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5928)|
| 1:38:56| whereby MPC, if the commission agrees to, rezone the undeveloped portions of the property at PR at 4.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5936)|
| 1:39:08| And then I guess I think the county commission has to initiate a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| so county commission could initiate a sector plan amendment whereby just the 19 acres where the apartment complex is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5953)|
| 1:39:22| be designated as HDR and zoned to what it is developed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| That way each parcel would have its own designated zoning and you could not transfer units from one parcel to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5966)|
| 1:39:35| which I think is part of the concern, which I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| They don't want another apartment complex up on the hill, which I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| This way it would prohibit and eliminate that gray area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| and have every parcel designated specifically to what it can and can't be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5985)|
| 1:39:53| Okay. Is that everything you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| Does everybody understand? It's clear as mud, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| Well, what I was going to do is stop the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| I think they've both kind of got their opening statements out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| but I'm sure there's probably some questions here on commission, probably for both you as well as the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| What I'd like to do is open the floor up for some general discussion before any motions are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| just to make sure, frankly, that everybody kind of understands at least what you're talking about with this that you brought to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| because it is a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| Yes, sir. I guess the first question I have is the 20-year covenants that come on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| I guess, has that expired? That's illegal. So that's expired and it's no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| They have expired in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| And I guess Mr. Green has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| I really didn't realize it until I sat here and looked at both of these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| Craig Allen requested a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| And it was Westland Drive, and I kind of thought I got confused there for just a second and looked at the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| It was approved by MPC, and it's 1,300 feet away from the one you denied on the other side of the Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6070)|
| 1:41:20| That's an odd, to say that there's enough change on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| but there's not on the west side, which is not true because the whole thing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| How does the MPC reckon that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| MPC's staff recommendation was for denial of both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| With this concern was somewhat going from LDR to HDR, but also I think Mr. Davis understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6098)|
| 1:41:48| looking at the larger parcel and making sure we addressed everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| that there was some concern about the ability to transfer density from the smaller department parcel to the larger parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6113)|
| 1:42:01| and a number of issues that weren't clearly resolved by taking a portion of the property and reviewing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| I think a better approach is the one that was identified by Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| looking at not only the apartment complex but the undeveloped portion and making sure we get everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| Okay. And I guess another, so with the conveyance being gone, the 20-year deal being gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6140)|
| 1:42:29| putting the apartments here, it's almost like they transferred development rights early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| before it was even a thing and it was legit and legal and people talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| but the conveyance is gone, right? So that's not even a question anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| And Mr. Sanders may want to weigh in because private agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| although we recognize those, we hold them as local government, we hold those at arm's length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| because we're not a party to them, either to the agreement or the enforcement of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| And what about, I guess, on the other side of the hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| When I drove out and looked at this and then actually went across the hill to grab something to eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| so I mean, this is similar to North Shore Town Center, kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| It's got high-density residential, it's got, the other side has a box store, this one has a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| but there's stuff, it's almost like a community right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| And so if it came to you as a planned town center type deal, it would be easier to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| this would be ideal is what you're looking for if you're doing a town center type approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| And again, that's why I think looking at it in more of a total, piece by piece, is a better approach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| Thank you. I thought I saw a light on it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| Commissioner Anders addressed my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| My point was that if this piece of property were brought to us today as a 113-acre track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| with a plan that's pretty much set up like it is with some medical, a retail, some commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6232)|
| 1:44:00| two apartments, then a church, and then low density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| we would probably all be very happy that we could do it, unlike the city did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| across the hill where they used tips and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| Okay. All right. Thank you. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| So procedurally, are we deferring this back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| Do we move the issue to another month until MPC deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| Or are we still looking at dealing with a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| to then address each portion of the property that's separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6268)|
| 1:44:35| Well, I think, and I'll get confirmation from the law director here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| just so what we actually have before us is a specific appeal on the denial that came from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6279)|
| 1:44:49| or originally an MPC commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| That is what we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Now, we can choose and vote on sending it back or how we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| but until we have a motion, we're not really voting on anything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| I think we're still just trying to make sure we all kind of understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| maybe understand the proposal that Mr. Davis has brought to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| I would ask, I think you had looked towards the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| so I would ask the law director way and also have Commissioner Schoonmaker's light on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| So this is an item or a situation where you've had a denial of a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| and rezoning that moved parallel through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| We've discussed this many times before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| There are layers to land use planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| One of those layers is the general plan, and when you have a general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| and then rezoning underneath that is another layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| The rezoning decisions have to be consistent with the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| so there's a vertical consistency requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| When Metropolitan Planning Commission denies a sector plan amendment with a parallel rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6351)|
| 1:45:58| the county commission doesn't have authority to rezone the property right then and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| because the rezoning would be inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| So what happens, the applicant will appeal the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| If it's the commission's desire that the property be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| the commission will then initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| The rezoning request will essentially stay with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| until the Metropolitan Planning Commission sends the sector plan amendment back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| and then the county commission can act on both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| What I hear Mr. Davis saying, and it addresses some of the concerns that I had with this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6391)|
| 1:46:39| the intent is to increase the density on a piece of undeveloped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6399)|
| 1:46:46| It does create a little bit of confusion to rezone one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| in order to increase the density on another piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| and what Mr. Davis has proposed addresses that confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| because what he's asking commission to do is also, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| initiate not only a sector plan amendment for the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| but also a rezoning application for the undeveloped portion of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| and commission has authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| So the way I understand it, you would do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| You would, one, initiate a sector plan amendment for the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| That would be from low-density residential to high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| Metropolitan Planning Commission would consider that, and then you would also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| the second thing you would do is initiate a rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| that would go before Metropolitan Planning Commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| Both of those items would come back to be considered together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| with the rezoning application for the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| and that could happen in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| That's the best I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| I've got a light on from Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| and a light on from Commissioner Dill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| and a light on from Commissioner Daly and then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| So we're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| I saw you rise, but if you'd like, I'm going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| and call these commissioners whose lights came on first, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| You will get to say everything you want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| This question is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| I'm trying to think through a hypothetical so I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| it might be an easier way to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| If a developer has 40 acres on Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| and half of the property is on the hillside facing towards the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| it's been the position of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| that the developer cluster their homes down facing towards Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6525)|
| 1:48:54| because the other property is somewhat, let's say, not buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| Has that still been the policy that you have been encouraging developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| to cluster the density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| We work with developers to cluster or to avoid to the extent possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| the steep hillsides, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Well, if you go forward with what they're proposing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| is that any development in south Knoxville or east Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| that has not first-class land but where they've done cluster housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| can come back at some point and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| okay, we're going to whack off 20 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| and that's where we have our cluster of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| and now this 20 acres of the 40 acres originally that's on the hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| we're going to put assisted living, apartments, we're going to put whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| So you're defeating the whole purpose of taking residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| and moving it to one section of the property to best utilize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| And that's basically what you have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| You've got basically a 100-acre track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| where they had X number of units that they could build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| They decided not to build out the entire track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| but to condense it down towards Westland Drive and build apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| And now they're saying they sold off a portion for a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| and partly for another residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| and now they have this extra land that wasn't first-class land to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| and now they want to go back to high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| So I don't really understand how we would want to open this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| to every development across the whole county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| where somebody who's followed the rules and gone by clustering a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| that has now vacant land that they can come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| oh, well, guess what, let's put something on that vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| The request, as I understand it from Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| would still be for planned residential zoning of the vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| If this moves forward and the zoning is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| the concept plan that would be submitted for that would be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| and we could work with the developer, whether it's Mr. Smith, Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| or someone else to avoid the steeper portions of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| I'm trying to look at the slope analysis there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| And this was for, I'm trying to think of the total, about 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| We didn't know exactly where the property lines were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| but there's 13 acres in the 15 to 25 percent, only 4 acres in the 25 to 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| So it appears there's ability to work with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| and assure that the damage or the grading and development of the steeper slopes is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6697)|
| 1:51:47| And that, again, is the intent of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| But, again, how do you prevent that down the road from affecting every other place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| across the county where they've done cluster developing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| And each one would be studied case by case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| and they would have to come before this body as the final arbitrator there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| Yes, can I have a point of clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| Yeah, you've got a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| They did not cluster all the available density onto this one site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| There was some remaining for future development on the rest of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| Yeah, but we're here to talk about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| John, go ahead and finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| I'm finished right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| I just wanted to hear from the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| because we're still going from PR 1 through 5 to PR 1 through 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| but will that reflection be different if it has to go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| This is the first I've heard from this tonight, the first I've heard of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| This is the wrong way to go about this, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| Number two, if you impose high-density residential in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| think of the future in this area where we have worked since 1985 to keep the density at a LDR status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6788)|
| 1:53:19| You bring it up to 1 to 14, and the next time somebody wants to develop something on Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| that is what the developer is going to look at and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| we've got 14 up there, we want 10 to 14 down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| I just heard Commissioner Anders in an earlier application go from 7 to 10 for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| This is improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| What's before you is a sector plan amendment and a redesignation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| but Commissioner Smith was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Right now, they can put 238 units on this area that's been undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| Why should you want to go to 355 from 238 through this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6836)|
| 1:54:03| It's like a circus here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| This is crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Why would this commission consider an amendment or, I'm sorry, an appeal like this on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6846)|
| 1:54:16| Because the sector plan says low-density residential at a density of 1 to 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6856)|
| 1:54:24| That's what it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| And that's what the area around this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| And let me just point out, because I think it's a lot different than the area over the hill at North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6868)|
| 1:54:36| Mr. Kline, you said how many units were available for development right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| 238.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| Well, if you go back at 51.5 acres times 4.5 an acre, that comes out to 231.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6881)|
| 1:54:49| Well, 238 is what the staff said they could develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| Currently, as it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| I'm just going by what the staff is saying because I agree with the staff's recommendation of denial 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| But if you go 51.5 acres times 4.5, that comes out to 231, which is less than you're saying they have available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| Seven units less than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| I'll defer to you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| 231.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| Why should it go from 231 to 355?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| That's my argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| It wouldn't go to 355.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| If you took the 51 acres that are left at 4.5 units an acre, it comes out to 231 units that could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| So why are we here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| So why don't you do it properly then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| Apply for rezoning for the acreage that's not been developed and do it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6933)|
| 1:55:40| I agree with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| Next is Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| I guess, Mr. Law Director, we're going to be voting on whether to uphold the decision to deny or to approve, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6950)|
| 1:56:00| That's our decision before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| It's not the amount of units per acre at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6961)|
| 1:56:07| That's one thing that could be before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| but in the past when you've dealt with these appeals that are denied essentially because they're not consistent with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6970)|
| 1:56:17| you've got a sense of what the commission wants to do, and if there's a sense that the rezoning is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6977)|
| 1:56:25| you have initiated a sector plan amendment, waited a month for it to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| and then looked at the whole thing together with the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| Now, what you're suggesting is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| You could take a vote on the application for appeal tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| but because it would not be consistent with the sector plan, you could not rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7002)|
| 1:56:51| Would it be proper to go ahead and have the applicant to postpone for 60, 90 days to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| and let the commission initiate a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| Essentially that's what has happened in the past when it's a sense of commission that the rezoning is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| Commission will make a motion to initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| Mr. Green may have some questions about exactly what the language of the sector plan amendment should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| and then the resolution says initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| It's considered by MPC at their next meeting, and it comes back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| and it's considered together with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| At that point, commission has the authority to adopt the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| and then consider the rezoning and either deny it or approve it or approve it with modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7055)|
| 1:57:43| Well, I agree with Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Smith that if this was brought before us now, it would be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| It is a perfect plan of what we needed in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| I know 20 years ago things were different, but 20 years from now things are going to be different too in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| So my suggestion was maybe if it's possible to postpone it, go back, have this commission initiate a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7080)|
| 1:58:07| and then that way, if this happens, we can withdraw this, applicant withdraw this in 30, 60 days or whatever, if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7087)|
| 1:58:17| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| Next, we do have two other commissioners that want to speak to this that have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| I know that Commissioner Jay has not spoken to this one, and Commissioner Bussler has not spoken with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| So I'd like to ask Commissioner Bussler, call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair. There's two numbers that are being thrown around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| There's a 200 and something number, and then there's a 300 and something number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7121)|
| 1:58:48| Which is correct? I mean, if it goes ahead, if we're zoning what they're asking for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| is it going to be a 200 and something total, or is it going to be the 300 number total on that piece of property if it goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7135)|
| 1:59:08| When staff calculated the number of units remaining, the staff person included a portion of the church property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7148)|
| 1:59:18| the undeveloped portion of the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| So that makes the number a bit higher than it would be for 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| I think it was calculated based on 70 acres, if I remember the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| And there's actually 51 acres, if that's correct, undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| So the staff's numbers are high because they included an additional 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7173)|
| 1:59:41| Was that because of the ball field? Because I know there's a soccer field behind the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| We counted that as potentially developable property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| And so that meant that our base acreage was lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| and so you calculate 70 times about 3.9 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| It was 238 acres, or 238 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| And then with higher density, that would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Density could indeed be transferred. It was 355. I'm trying to remember the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| So the total units we're talking about is 239.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| Mr. Davis can correct me, but given the 51 acres undeveloped property that he's looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| if indeed the request that he made of 4.5 units per acre is approved, that's 231.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7227)|
| 2:00:39| Now the property on which the apartments are on now, what are they zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7239)|
| 2:00:46| Are they zoned 4.5 or 5 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| They're planned residential 1 to 5 dwelling units an acre, and as I think Mr. Klein said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| that density was transferred from the larger parcel down to the apartment development portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7254)|
| 2:01:01| So basically what we're talking about right now is 51 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7261)|
| 2:01:08| I mean, that's 51.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| And that's what makes this confusing. We're not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| The appeal before you is for the zoning and sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| only for the portion of property developed for the apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| and then I think that's what some of the concern is that does that, if there's then excess density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| does it indeed transfer to the rest of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| And the approach of looking at it as a total clears up that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| may address some of the issues the neighborhood has with the total property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| A couple questions. Mr. Green, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| Mr. Green, can you just clarify the difference between low density, residential, medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7311)|
| 2:01:57| Is there a medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| There is a medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| And high? Can you give me those three levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| Low is 1 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| Medium is 6 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| And I always get, because it's different in the city than the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| so this is, and the high is more than 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Just to quickly address, you don't need to get up, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| I just quickly wanted to say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| You asked why would we consider things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| and I think this body is continuously approached with market changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7348)|
| 2:02:35| Knox County was a vastly different place 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| It is developing quickly, and I spent a good amount of time driving this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| driving around, driving through the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| and driving through the neighborhood and developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| and of all the concerns that were sent to me about traffic and space and density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| and everything else, I felt this to be the most appropriate use for this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| that I think I've seen in a long time of looking at every other hillside that's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| I went during rush hour and didn't have any other issue with traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| than I've had anywhere else in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| It was not egregious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| The development was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| The building was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| It seemed all but appropriate to continue this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| and from every plan I've seen, it doesn't involve taking a hillside off the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| building any huge residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| I understand that the Neighborhood Association may have had a plan and a purpose 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| but most of this whole area was not developed 20 years ago, and things change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| and I think this body is going to continue to be challenged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| where do we use available land to house a growing population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| and if it's appropriate, people have a right to develop their land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| and things are willing to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| and I think that's very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| So do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| What I'm here tonight on is 19.3 acres attempted to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7441)|
| 2:04:08| such that the density per unit goes to 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7448)|
| 2:04:16| If you have high-density residential development in this area at 14 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| which is what is being asked of you tonight on this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| then that destroys the low-density nature of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| and that's what we're here fighting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| I didn't talk about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| I didn't talk about the inability to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| Mr. Smith and I have worked together for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| What I'm saying is you don't take an appeal from a denial of a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7482)|
| 2:04:49| and a sector plan amendment on 19.3 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| and turn it into something that's applicable to 51.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| That's improper because in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| when we look at the density in this area for some other development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| that 14 sticks out like a sore thumb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| and it's improper to have high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| I'm not going back 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| I'm going to go back two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| And the Southwest Sector Plan that was amended in 2016 that says this area should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| low-density residential, one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| End.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| That being the case, I think that the commission should find a way to send this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| I think the market has changed, the area has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| and that we ought to find a way to adapt to our needs of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| I think almost every commissioner has spoken on this except for Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| and Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| I know that this is getting a little bit long in a tooth, but I wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| Commissioner Gill, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| And I just simply want to speak to the process of presenting this plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| And I think that is part of the process that we have to deal with in order for the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| to be conveyed to commissioners correctly to be studied with the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| that was presented by Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| I think that information then needs to be part of the decision as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| to be presented back to MPC to be presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| Is there a yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| Would you mind stating your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| Sharon Boyce, 9520 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7594)|
| 2:06:40| I don't know where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| The process is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| You have an application before you that Mr. Davis filed, so you can act upon it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| So it's 19 acres, and he asked that the density on the existing apartments be increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7613)|
| 2:07:00| So I guess you could deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| You can approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| He doesn't own, he doesn't represent anybody else on this track over all these years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| all these different owners there from the church, nobody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| How do they know that, you know, you're changing things tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| The homeowners that live there, the daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| and I don't know if there are other properties owned by different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| Mr. Smith is here, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| So, I mean, I think you could act on his, and he might get what he, if you approved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| he gets 1 to 14 on developed property with apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7658)|
| 2:07:46| Is that really what he wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| I don't know why he filed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| But my point to you is this is really a mess, and I don't think it just should be remanded to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| Mr. Davis and other property owners, if they're interested in having the density on their property increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7677)|
| 2:08:06| should be the one who file a new application for whatever it is he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| I don't think it goes back to MPC where they change for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| Someone requesting sector plan changes for whatever property he owns or represents or has an option on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7699)|
| 2:08:27| I mean, this is, you've got all these other people that aren't here that own property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7707)|
| 2:08:34| and it's not a point of remanding it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| He needs to clearly refile and say whatever he wants for whatever he has an option on or owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7718)|
| 2:08:45| And somehow this has gotten amazingly out of hand, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7725)|
| 2:08:50| and very unfair to other people that are in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7730)|
| 2:08:55| And I'll answer one question, Mr. J, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| Westland Drive has 11,000 cars per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| The units on Emory Church Road will add another 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| That doesn't count Bills Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| That doesn't count Westland Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| And it doesn't count the 2,000 cars a day that will be there at the end of Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| So I think in two years you'll see gridlock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7757)|
| 2:09:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| Okay, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7765)|
| 2:09:26| If I could respond briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| If this is done as I respectfully request of the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| it goes back to MPC to be heard at the November 8th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| Because between now and November 8th there will be more than adequate time for anyone in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| because it should have been noticed during the zoning side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| But we're not talking about anything changing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| This goes back to MPC to be heard at November 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| So nothing is happening without anybody's notice, without anybody's awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| To summarize, in a way you're saying if this gets basically rejected via asking for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7800)|
| 2:10:05| effectively it's almost as if we're asking for a reapplication by sending it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| Is that in a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| I know she had just mentioned you need to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| By sending this back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| would the process that this would go through in terms of notification, review, all the steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| would that be the same types of steps if you had reapplied for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| To my understanding that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| So it would all be noticed in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| The property owners would be notified just like they do through a normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| So we have it between now and November 8th when it's heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| So that should be more than sufficient time for anyone in opposition to gather the information that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7835)|
| 2:10:40| So effectively the difference would be either this body would be the ones telling you to reapply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| or you'd be doing that yourself if this appeal is effectively restated or denied how it's stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7845)|
| 2:10:53| and then replaced with the substitute motion effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| I've probably got the language a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| But that would be the outcome of that would be the same thing as if you had also just reapplied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7859)|
| 2:11:05| Because you'd be talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| I would want a clarification from Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| A reapplication would happen one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| It would just be a question as would it be determined by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| or would it be determined by Mr. Davis and Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| The only difference would be in the name of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| I just want to try to clear something up and maybe get a better understanding of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| First, I want to understand why this approach was taken with going to the apartment and upping the density on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| And two, why is there necessarily a need for a sector plan change on that parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7900)|
| 2:11:48| The sector plan designation currently on the entire parcel or this area is low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7908)|
| 2:11:55| And I think that would clear up the start dividing the parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7915)|
| 2:12:01| and applying their zoning to them based on their development and their density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7921)|
| 2:12:08| And to answer the second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| when we went up to apply for one to five units per acre on the remaining undeveloped portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| we were advised that we couldn't do that because it would make the apartment piece nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| So I went and met with Mr. Dan Kelly, unfortunately, who's no longer here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| But he advised to go this route because it would then make the apartment complex conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| And that was the reason why we went this route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| Because if we had gone the other route, it potentially would have made the apartment piece nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| and it would have been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| And I later learned from Mr. Sanders, which I did not know at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| that there's a state law that protects multifamily housing against the nonconforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| which we did not know prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| And so that's why we applied the way we did to make sure the apartment complex was conforming and currently done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7972)|
| 2:13:00| So this cleans up everything, any mistake that we made, any attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| Hopefully this clears everything up and each piece of property gets its own specific designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| and there's no ambiguity, no gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| It's very clear what you can and cannot do with the parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=7993)|
| 2:13:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| I'm trying to understand Mr. Kline and his concern that this does open up for further development down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8004)|
| 2:13:30| How many other pieces of parcels are within proximity of that that has a higher density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8010)|
| 2:13:38| Mayor of this church road, I was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| There are no parcels close by that have a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8020)|
| 2:13:46| Hampton Hall subdivisions on the opposite side has 103 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| Westland Gardens, just east of Lots Elementary, has 54 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| Beals Creek on Moorfield Road, that's MBC Commissioner Smith's development, has 55 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8035)|
| 2:14:03| And Mr. Davis has a subdivision called Westland Oaks, just west of this property, is approved for 73 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8043)|
| 2:14:10| That's phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| He's got another potential 70-plus units in phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| How far is the Mayor of the church road development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| Emery Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| Oh, it's within a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| And it's a high-density development also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| No, it's not high-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| What is it at, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| What they did is the same thing that's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| They took all their density and they clustered it into creating an apartment complex on Emery Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8075)|
| 2:14:42| I can see this being a precedent for them coming back and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| Well, it's been a few years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| What we want to do now is we want to take the undeveloped property and we'll just increase the density everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| All of a sudden, we're going to have 14 dwelling units per acre on the entire undeveloped property out in our neck of the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8093)|
| 2:15:01| It's simply not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8101)|
| 2:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8111)|
| 2:15:17| Mr. Woodall, I see you're standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| Yeah, Mr. Kline noticed the number of units in those things, but all of those are less than one to five units per acre as they're developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8121)|
| 2:15:30| The apartment complex on Emery Church Road is one to five, and as Mr. Kline said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| there's a lot of hillside land around that part that ended up with the density being concentrated in the areas that it was possible to actually build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8137)|
| 2:15:51| So that's what this area is around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| You know, basically, there's no reason why the commission shouldn't just deny this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| and have Mr. Davis come back later and make an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| Otherwise, I mean, the confusion level on this is enormous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| and there's no reason why it should be added to the confusion level by some motion at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8170)|
| 2:16:17| when all that needs to be done is for Mr. Davis to come back and make an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| for the different pieces of property that he's talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| He said there was something that caused this whole thing to get started because of an issue of nonconforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| which has now been apparently stated that that's really not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| And so, you know, this thing just needs to start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| It needs to get started all over again by denying this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| and letting Mr. Davis come back and make his applications for the different pieces of properties he's talked about wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8207)|
| 2:16:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I'm not really speaking the issue that is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| but I'd like to speak for just a second about being here on commission for some years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| and spending in that number of years a considerable amount of time on the slope and ridge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8229)|
| 2:17:17| I've heard it spoken to two or three different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| and I think it's I need to get a little clarification in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| because I think when we dealt with slope and ridge and we cluster development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8246)|
| 2:17:34| the part that's not built on is never built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| And I think I've heard people speak to the fact that there are some developments feared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8259)|
| 2:17:47| that we may come back on slope and ridge clusterings and build on the undeveloped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8267)|
| 2:17:56| I don't think that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| I do not remember, Mr. Green, were you here through slope and ridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| I don't think you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| No, I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8286)|
| 2:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| So then I would have to then maybe look toward the law department asking if you take a 10-acre piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8288)|
| 2:18:17| and you cluster development for that 10-acre piece of property and you leave some vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8297)|
| 2:18:24| because the development has taken place on the small corner or the buildable land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8304)|
| 2:18:35| there's no going back on the unbuilt part of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| That's not necessarily true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| Let me say it again what I then started whenever I went off on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8324)|
| 2:18:51| That was my understanding when we worked through slope and ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| is that we would take the one residence for two acres or whatever it was on the steepest parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8336)|
| 2:19:03| and we would move that one residence off the steep part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| and the steep part would never be then gone back to because its count was clustered in a more developable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8348)|
| 2:19:21| So the mechanism by which units are clustered on a piece of property is zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8361)|
| 2:19:29| And although zoning is somewhat permanent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| the county commission has the ultimate authority to adopt amendments to the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| and those can take the form of a text amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| You'll see those from time to time or the form of a map amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| And so once county commission zones the 10-acre parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8388)|
| 2:19:55| and units are clustered on part of that 10-acre parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| there is a process for rezoning the remaining property to allow higher density on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8399)|
| 2:20:07| And one county commission from, say, 1999 doesn't forever bind the hands of a county commission 20 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8407)|
| 2:20:18| But there is a process and there have been some concerns raised about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| And I think there's a way to get where the applicant wants to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8423)|
| 2:20:29| but it's really about what the sense of commission is and whether commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| I apologize for that, whether it's a sense of commission that it wants to increase density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8434)|
| 2:20:41| and how it wants the county to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| So there's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Zoning is not a permanent thing that is forever and never more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8448)|
| 2:20:55| For the commission that I sat on when slope and ridge was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8455)|
| 2:21:06| it was the intent, I think, of the commission at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| that that density wouldn't be messed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| I was here for a little bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| And, you know, the commission, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| did something that was unique as far as the slope and ridge top plan went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| They adopted a paragraph that was sort of a prefatory paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| that said that the slope and ridge top protection plan was advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| and non-binding guidelines to sort of guide future land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8497)|
| 2:21:43| And we've since had a litigation that I was involved in and Mr. Klein was involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8503)|
| 2:21:50| that had an opportunity to interpret that paragraph in the slope and ridge top protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8510)|
| 2:21:56| And the court said that it was non-binding and advisory for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| and didn't necessarily control future land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| So I begin to then think I see that if we have a piece of property that is zoned low density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8529)|
| 2:22:21| that at some point in the future we can go back and change the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| and maybe have that then piece of property rezoned to medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8547)|
| 2:22:34| There is a procedure for that, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| And slope and ridge would then be circumvented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8557)|
| 2:22:44| The intent of slope and ridge would be circumvented, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| I thought Smith had it on before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| Because I definitely remember it being the intent to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| and move the density and never look at where the density was moved from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8575)|
| 2:23:02| That was the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8582)|
| 2:23:03| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8583)|
| 2:23:09| I hesitate to comment on exactly what the intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| I think the slope and ridge top protection plan speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| Respectfully, what the interpretation or recollection of one member of the body is about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8598)|
| 2:23:27| doesn't control exactly what the thing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Ten years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| Ten years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| And we've had subsequent court proceedings that have interpreted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| I'll let the document speak for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| I will say that we've had a chancellor here in the county say that the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| and ridge top protection plan was merely advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| And I'll refer you back to the prefatory paragraph that explains that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8631)|
| 2:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| Anything else, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| I acknowledge that Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Anders have their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| However, I also have noticed that the master developer of the property, Mr. Smith, has approached the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8648)|
| 2:24:15| I would like to give you a chance to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| Oliver Smith, 6207 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| We are the owners of the property, our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8662)|
| 2:24:25| First of all, I want to clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| Mr. Davis is representing our family in this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| and I was in the meeting with Dan Kelly when he gave us that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| The intent here is to, as Commissioner Anders and I think Commissioner Daley and Commissioner Jay said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8675)|
| 2:24:44| was to finish out what I considered a master plan community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| The back was not effectively developed, not because of its undevelopable properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8689)|
| 2:24:57| but because we felt over time the best thing to do is you put your density apartments down close to the interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8697)|
| 2:25:05| and that's the way it's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| And I can't remember, I think it's Commissioner Smith that mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| This was brought to you now in today's world where you had light neighborhood use at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8711)|
| 2:25:17| the waggles and so forth, and then you transitioned to multifamily and a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| and then you had the church as a transition zone for protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| and then you wrapped the residential around it in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| All we're talking about is allowing us the ability to look at probably doing three units to the acre in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8730)|
| 2:25:37| We will work under Commissioner Wright's concerns about working with the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8737)|
| 2:25:45| do the planning reviews process about the slope, and taking that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8745)|
| 2:25:51| But as to what we're doing with the balance of the property, we're just finishing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| You know, it's half the property is undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| and I think we're abiding by the spirit of that neighborhood about what has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| And as to Mr. Kline's concern about the density there at the interchange, I understand what he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8765)|
| 2:26:13| but based upon planners, you can look at the Knoxville codes and their new ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8773)|
| 2:26:20| transitioning multifamily around the corners of interchanges and thoroughfares are part of the new planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8780)|
| 2:26:29| So it is not our intention in any way or form or fashion to develop the back property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| One, it's topographically where you can't do that, and that's why we're looking at the three units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| and then we're looking at maybe a possible senior living development there on the little lake that's left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8799)|
| 2:26:48| and that's only four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| When that is done, and Mr. Davis is looking at the back piece with us, that will be the completion of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8810)|
| 2:26:57| I think we've done a very good job completing it and meeting the guidelines of what I call mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8817)|
| 2:27:03| That happens to be our firm's specialty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| We do them not here, but quite a few throughout the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| So I defer to the commissioners the process, but I think we want everyone to feel comfortable that this isn't being done for an abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8830)|
| 2:27:21| We lived under and abided by that agreement for 20 years, and we didn't go above those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| and this is just finishing it out, what I think is the proper way and the highest and best use of the residual property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8847)|
| 2:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8857)|
| 2:27:38| Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| Kind of what Mr. Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| If it is one of our objectives to get a higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| if it came to you today with apartments on that 19 acres within its proximity to the interstate and westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8867)|
| 2:27:55| that would probably be an approvable project, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8875)|
| 2:28:02| That's a tough question, having not looked at it as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| I would think it would, at a minimum, be reasonable to do minimum density residential at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8885)|
| 2:28:11| Looking at higher density could be considered at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| Okay, and as to this being a domino effect down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8895)|
| 2:28:22| that being at a higher density because of its proximity to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| would be an argument that parcel owners on down the road would not be able to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8906)|
| 2:28:33| Well, I'm sure they'd use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| But it wouldn't hold ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| I'll never try to guess what 17 planning commissioners and 11 county commissioners would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8918)|
| 2:28:44| but staff would look at each case individually and make a recommendation based on the individual merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8924)|
| 2:28:51| But none of those pieces of property would have that merit of having that proximity to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| This question is to Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| I'm very confused now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| You're saying that you want to develop the balance of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| Is that balance 50-plus acres, 51, 52?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| Fifty-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8960)|
| 2:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| And you're saying you want to develop it out at three units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| No, what I'm saying is the back portion of the property is the way to develop that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8965)|
| 2:29:31| It's about three units to the acre in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| That's the four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| And we'd like to retain some on the four-acre tract up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| And that to do the senior living project we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| But those will be under PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| They'll go back through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| We've already spoken with the association that they're up for the Heritage Lake homeowners, and they understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8987)|
| 2:29:54| And I have an understanding tonight they'll be involved with that process when we get to the PR planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| But we'll go right through MPC with Mr. Green and his group to approve any of those developments that'll be coming here in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9001)|
| 2:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9011)|
| 2:30:12| So at the 4.5, that's, he did the math, I think it was 238 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9012)|
| 2:30:21| Is that what you want to build on that balance of the 51.5 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| It's, what is the count, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| We're talking probably around 130 units in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| Mr. Smith is proposing 75 senior living units on a portion fronting Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9033)|
| 2:30:43| which would remain 130 plus or minus units on the very back portion, which would be roughly three units an acre on the back portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9043)|
| 2:30:51| And if I did something contrary to that, or if Mr. Smith did, MPC has every right to reject that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9051)|
| 2:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| So if you're saying 75 and 135, that's about 210 total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| It was whatever the math is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9069)|
| 2:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9070)|
| 2:31:11| You're allowed to do that right now today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| You could walk out of here tomorrow and build 210 units on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| On the 51 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| Staff did the calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| We included about 20 acres of undeveloped church property, so you'd have to take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9083)|
| 2:31:31| So what is the total of 51.5 acres that if they walked out of here and tomorrow morning they could have built on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9091)|
| 2:31:41| Right now it's probably one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| 119, I believe is the current number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| About 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9108)|
| 2:31:49| On the 51.5 acres, they could build 120 units plus or minus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| So we're not asking in the back will only be three, and the ridge top will be kept as protection for the adjoining properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9118)|
| 2:32:07| It will only be three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| And this stuff down front, we'll still have to go through planning the view stage for the senior living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| but it's our understanding there's a large demand for these type of units in that area because of all the people not wanting to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9135)|
| 2:32:22| This is not an assisted living, which is like we're talking about across the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| A little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9146)|
| 2:32:27| And it's not independent living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| These are focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| It's a new program focused towards people in their 65 to 80 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9152)|
| 2:32:37| That are still mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| Excuse me, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| That are still mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9160)|
| 2:32:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9162)|
| 2:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9163)|
| 2:32:44| This question, then, is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| This is very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| From the novice, is this not better to just deny this request and then start over with ground zero for the balance of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9173)|
| 2:33:04| I think that's somewhat what Mr. Davis was asking in that, you know, remand back the sector designation for the apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9184)|
| 2:33:15| but initiate a zoning consideration for the undeveloped portion so we look at it more as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9195)|
| 2:33:23| So is there an advantage if we denied this appeal and then let them to start out ground zero with all new paperwork?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9203)|
| 2:33:32| If you deny it, if they came back, and I'll look to Mr. Sanders to confirm this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| if they tried to come back for a similar designation for the apartment complex, they'd have to wait a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| But forget the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| It's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9224)|
| 2:33:45| The balance of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| You can't forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| It's nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9229)|
| 2:33:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| They can't come with a concept plan to say, hey, we want to put high density towards Westland and single family in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9235)|
| 2:34:06| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9246)|
| 2:34:08| I'm trying to think through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9248)|
| 2:34:09| I do think it would be better to look at it more as a totality than, again, pieces at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9249)|
| 2:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| I see that you're there, but I also have noticed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9264)|
| 2:34:26| I was just answering questions if there was any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9268)|
| 2:34:29| We've got Commissioner Jay and then Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| You turned your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| It was on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9273)|
| 2:34:34| Yeah, I'm still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9274)|
| 2:34:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9275)|
| 2:34:36| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9276)|
| 2:34:37| I think the part that we're missing here is that you kind of can't do anything without sector plan changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| You can't act on the request to rezone the apartment complex without a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9288)|
| 2:34:56| Unless you act to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| And if this body were to act on this motion but then make a recommendation for MPC to revisit a sector change, a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9299)|
| 2:35:12| that's simply this body saying, look, we hope that MPC goes back and revisits the sector plan to a certain new level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9312)|
| 2:35:19| so you can start figuring out how to develop this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| It's simply a recommendation to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| It's not a you have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| It's us sort of kicking it back down to the lower body saying we feel like this is an area that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| and should be developed in an appropriate way, and we want you to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9334)|
| 2:35:39| The sector plan may have changed in the last 20 years, so we want you to revisit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| And then that body could then pick that up and discernment it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| We're simply giving some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| It doesn't mean it's an all in fast rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| They may say thanks for your direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| We don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9364)|
| 2:36:05| Some questions, Mr. Green, for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| We have a piece of property out there that we have a nonconforming use on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9367)|
| 2:36:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| No, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| So the apartments are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| They're zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| They're zoned and they're developed according to the concept plan approved for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| So they're conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| So that piece of property is zoned, what, 14 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9385)|
| 2:36:29| First up, the apartments were developed in the plan residential where the density for the larger tract was transferred to the apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9389)|
| 2:36:43| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| Would it become nonconforming if the density was changed on the 51 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9405)|
| 2:36:54| If the density were increased on the 51 acres so that the development proposed by Mr. Smith and Mr. Davis proceeded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9414)|
| 2:37:03| it would have to have enough remaining density to accommodate the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9423)|
| 2:37:13| So it would have to be zoned at more than 4.5 units an acre to allow the development they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9433)|
| 2:37:19| and also to transfer some density to the apartments to keep them conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9439)|
| 2:37:26| So going back, we don't have a nonconforming issue with the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9452)|
| 2:37:34| But what he has left or what they have left on that acreage is, what, 236 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9454)|
| 2:37:45| 119.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| 119 is the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| The maximum right now is my calculations, and I think the maximum right now that you can do on the remaining 51.5 acres is 119 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9470)|
| 2:37:59| And what we're attempting to do is all this is very confusing for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| And what I'm proposing, in my opinion, cleans all of this up and eliminates any ambiguity, any gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9484)|
| 2:38:15| It gives each piece of property its own specific designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| Therefore, there's no misunderstanding of what you could and couldn't do with this piece or this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9500)|
| 2:38:25| It makes it clear for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9505)|
| 2:38:29| So it's like a plan, a whole new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| This is what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| This is what will be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| And that's it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| Correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9519)|
| 2:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| Thank you, Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| I think the more we speak to it, the more confusing it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| And so I'm going to make a motion to send back to MPC in regards to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9527)|
| 2:38:56| I guess Gerald would correct me on that, to look at the sector plan as a property as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| and bring it up to conformity and to look at the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9546)|
| 2:39:07| I mean, is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| Is that, Daniel, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| The language in the state statute grants the commission authority to initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9552)|
| 2:39:19| And in this case, what the applicant has requested is a sector plan amendment from low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9559)|
| 2:39:25| to high-density residential for the property where the apartment complexes are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9565)|
| 2:39:32| So that's the authority under the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| It would go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| They can approve, deny, or pass on it with no recommendation, and it comes back to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| I'd like to make a motion, or I'd like for our motion to be a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9585)|
| 2:39:50| Can we do it as that partial as a whole, to review that, to get to ground zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9590)|
| 2:39:57| to get everybody on the same playing field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| I mean, the county commission can initiate whatever amount of sector plan change it wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| subject to the requirements of amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| And those are requirements that you're familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| They are listed in this very rezoning application on page 32-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9614)|
| 2:40:26| But the commission's authority is not limited as far as the scope of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9626)|
| 2:40:32| the amount of property it wants to amend the sector plan for, as long as those conditions are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9632)|
| 2:40:42| I'd like to recommend this matter be remanded back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| The 51 acres of undeveloped land be part of Heritage Lake development be approved rezoning at 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9647)|
| 2:40:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| Who's the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Was it Larson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| You were finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9668)|
| 2:41:09| Well, I was finished, but in context, I mean, your desire is to look at it as a whole, to clean it up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9669)|
| 2:41:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9676)|
| 2:41:17| And I think that's what is best for the, that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9682)|
| 2:41:23| I'll keep my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9683)|
| 2:41:24| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| We now have discussion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| This does not address, then, the density on the front parcel, the front portion of the parcel, which is what the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9696)|
| 2:41:45| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9705)|
| 2:41:46| Well, if we look at the parcel as a whole, the sector designation of the parcel as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9706)|
| 2:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9713)|
| 2:41:54| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9714)|
| 2:41:55| I'm going to step in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| Commissioner Anders, after conferring with the law department, I believe that your motion was related to zoning when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9717)|
| 2:42:07| based on the intent that I picked up, I believe it was more related to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9727)|
| 2:42:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| We're going to have to apply for a sector plan change, not for a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9733)|
| 2:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9736)|
| 2:42:17| But the intent is to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| My point is, you made the motion, your motion stated zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| So I wanted to get that clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| I heard you thinking that you're wanting to make a motion related to the sector plan and not the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| And I looked at the law department to say what is the proper motion, if that's his intent, to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| If it's county commission's intent that it consider the present rezoning application, which is for the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9759)|
| 2:42:48| the commission needs to initiate a sector plan amendment for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9768)|
| 2:42:54| You can initiate a sector plan amendment for a larger area if you want, but it must at least include that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9774)|
| 2:43:03| That's what I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| I want to initiate a sector plan change for the apartments on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9784)|
| 2:43:09| In the context of that, I want Gerald to look at that as a whole and make sure we're doing everybody around it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9789)|
| 2:43:17| And so this is just for clarification purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| I'm not pretending to tell the commission what it should or shouldn't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9800)|
| 2:43:23| but the applicant has requested in association with this sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9803)|
| 2:43:28| that the commission also initiate a rezoning application for the undeveloped portion of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9808)|
| 2:43:35| That's just what I've heard, and that's the best summary that I can give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| So it would be two actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| Are we allowed to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| Well, the commission can initiate an application for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9822)|
| 2:43:47| It would appear before Metropolitan Planning Commission as any other initial application for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9827)|
| 2:43:54| It would be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9834)|
| 2:43:55| There would be a staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| The Metropolitan Planning Commission would take a vote and make a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| just like any other rezoning except the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| The applicant would be county commission instead of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| I'm not interested in rezoning somebody else's property, but I am interested in initiating a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9849)|
| 2:44:15| And then would it be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| And holding this rezoning until that sector plan change comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9856)|
| 2:44:22| And Mr. Anderson, I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| Now, time-wise, we started this in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9864)|
| 2:44:29| If today was the following deadline to reapply for rezoning for the November meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9869)|
| 2:44:37| this would now kick it into the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| And then if the sector plan has to come back, it potentially could go back through two to three more times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| going back to commission, going back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| We could be back up here about June of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9886)|
| 2:44:53| But if we could do this, if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| So if the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| And this is all due respect to the commission and whatever's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| And it's Mr. Smith's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| Mr. Smith is here to say, yes, I'll approve of that rezoning of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| And so if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| So we're dealing with two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| If commission is willing to initiate a sector plan amendment for either the department piece or the piece in totality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9920)|
| 2:45:29| And or initiate a rezoning for the remaining 4.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9929)|
| 2:45:37| With the consent of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| And then everything would go to MPC collectively together to be heard at the November 8th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9941)|
| 2:45:48| And then it would come back to you all at the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| So it would come back to you at the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9962)|
| 2:46:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| So basically what the application that we have before us today stays in limbo until this amendment or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9977)|
| 2:46:25| this motion that Commissioner Anders has made goes through the cycle of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9995)|
| 2:46:36| Yeah, I think that's this agenda item just stays in limbo and no action is taken on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=9996)|
| 2:46:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10001)|
| 2:46:42| It has to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10002)|
| 2:46:43| I think that's the only way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10003)|
| 2:46:44| Does everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10009)|
| 2:46:50| Both the items of the rezoning and the sector plan amendment will appear back on the agenda together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| when MPC has a chance to make a recommendation or consider it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10014)|
| 2:47:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10020)|
| 2:47:01| So it would just be deferred until we hear back from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10021)|
| 2:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10029)|
| 2:47:10| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| And then I'm going to just so you know the order I'm going to call based on where I'm seeing the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| I call it Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| Next will be Smith, Carringer, and then Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10038)|
| 2:47:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| So go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| It's my understanding that unless we change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10048)|
| 2:47:31| that's going to really drive what the rezoning could possibly be on the additional 51 acres, 51 1⁄2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10051)|
| 2:47:40| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| So it would be wise of us to have both of those addressed at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| That would be take a more practical approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10074)|
| 2:47:55| I'm not sure I quite understood Commissioner Anders' motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| but I was thinking our motion should be that we defer back to MPC for a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180924?start=10079)|
