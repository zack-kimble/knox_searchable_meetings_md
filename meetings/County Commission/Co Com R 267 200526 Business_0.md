| 0:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| All right, well we will move forward with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| First is a commissioner skin maker which please lead us into nice devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, unfortunately on Memorial Day we were unable to acknowledge our military heroes and proper fashion so would you join me now in a Memorial Day prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=129)|
| 0:02:23| Lord on the day after Memorial Day. I am thankful for the sacrifice so many throughout our history have made for the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice, and for their families who had to carry on without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=143)|
| 0:02:38| Today I remember a sacrifice made and a debt I cannot repay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| Today I pray for the God of heaven to bless the families of those who lost loved ones while serving our great nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=164)|
| 0:02:52| I pray for him to bless and comfort, the walking wounded, who are still with us, and bless their families as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=172)|
| 0:03:01| It is also my prayer that we remember their sacrifice, and their precious gift of freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| Every day, not just once a year, or when we are in danger of it being taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| We ask this in your loving name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| Next, Commissioner Beeler, would you please lead us in a pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| I will indeed. Please stand and salute our nation's flag and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=209)|
| 0:03:49| Thank you. And I know, before we jump into the agenda, I know shortly before the meeting, Commissioner Daley had mentioned to me that he wanted to recognize a World War II veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=229)|
| 0:04:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Today, South Knoxville laid to rest a great man, 96-year-old Captain George L. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=248)|
| 0:04:21| Excuse me. Captain Buchanan flew on a B-24. He was a pilot on a B-24 during World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=261)|
| 0:04:32| And he was successful in 28 missions. And I just want to say thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=272)|
| 0:04:43| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| You know, I've got something else as well that I wanted to share briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| My son, oh gosh, about six or so weeks ago, wrote a note to Hershel Woody Williams. Woody is a Medal of Honor recipient from World War II who earned the Medal of Honor serving in the Pacific Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=289)|
| 0:05:09| Woody's note, and I'm going to abridge it briefly, but he wrote our son back. It was very nice and unexpected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=309)|
| 0:05:18| But he said, Trace, thank you for your recent letter. Sorry I'm taking so long in getting back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| I appreciate your thoughts about what you said in your letter so true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| You know, I, as well as you and so many others, are concerned about our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| We've not been more divided except for, in many cases, the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| As terrible as this virus is, maybe, just maybe, it can bring us back together and cause the citizens of our country to again realize that without divine intervention, we can become a lost cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=334)|
| 0:05:44| We've already exceeded so many years that other folks have survived as a free people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| That goes on a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| But, you know, then one thing that he says, you know, he talks about how they've been coping with the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| And, you know, he closed his letter to my son with, you know, I've been designated a hero many times since World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| But in my mind, the heroes never got to come home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| The rest of us were blessed with the opportunity of coming home to our loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| And I'm grateful to be one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| My wife, who is in heaven, had a saying that she would remind us of very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Life is God's gift to us. And what we do with that life is our gift to God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| So it was just a small world that this letter came to us right on the eve of Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| And I'm just glad that, you know, all of my fellow commissioners and, you know, our community really does appreciate what so many of our folks have done and have paid the supreme sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=387)|
| 0:06:39| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Now we'll move on with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| But first, as I always do, I want to I realize we do have some folks who may be tuning in to this meeting for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| And just or you might have something you're watching and you may have come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| But, you know, kind of how county commission meetings work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| We have two meetings a month, two formal meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| The first meeting is usually the third Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| The second meeting is usually the fourth meeting of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| And because of Memorial Day yesterday, the May meeting, as always, are historically usually on that Tuesday, every May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| The first meeting is considered a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| We've already had that work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| We made our first path through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| We worked on things, debated things, discussed things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| And a lot of the things that were debated and to a certain extent passed already were put on something called a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=446)|
| 0:07:34| So tonight you'll see a lengthy consent agenda from school related activities, as well as a lengthy consent agenda from our general county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=454)|
| 0:07:43| And we as a body, all those items will be read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| And then we will have one vote for all of those items that have already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| You then, to our viewers, we will have a handful of items that have moved forward, either without a recommendation or maybe even been added tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=471)|
| 0:08:00| That will then have a kind of a full debate and or, you know, discuss and vote and pass or not pass at the meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| So last week's meeting was a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Tonight's meeting is the actual voting session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| So I hope that helps explain everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Moving forward, Drusilla, have we received any very recent comments in the last hour or so to public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=495)|
| 0:08:24| No, I've not received anything as of the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Okay. Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| And I'll look, I know we have several folks that have logged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| At last week's meeting, Mayor Jacobs gave us a really deep, detailed update on the Corona, a lot of the things the county was working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| I will allow Mayor Jacobs, if you've got any other updates or things you wanted to share with the commission tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Now's a good time to do so if you've got any additional updates to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| But otherwise, we did not. I didn't have that on my agenda and I hadn't heard from you, but I did want to give you that chance in case you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| Commissioner, probably the most important thing is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| I'm not going to move into phase two of the reopening plan, which takes some further restrictions off of certain businesses and allows other businesses to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=538)|
| 0:09:09| We also have our splash pads and our parks are now open as well as some of our other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Friday, we will be opening eight of our libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| We talked with Maria Black from libraries and they'd already developed a bit of a plan for what they felt would be appropriate for you as we ramp back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=559)|
| 0:09:32| So we're looking forward to that, too. And that's about all I can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Okay. Moving on. For those who are watching, this is the part of the meeting where we actually formally vote on and set our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=580)|
| 0:09:50| I also want to before we do that or conduct any formal business, I do want to remind the public that you may be wondering why we're doing this during Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=590)|
| 0:09:58| But this meeting is taking place electronically because of a public order that was passed by Governor Bill Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| Executive order is executive order 16. And that executive order was actually extended recently to go through the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=605)|
| 0:10:14| So we are now meeting electronically because of that executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| I would like before we conduct any formal business just to as we we did this during the during the bear board meeting and actually during our pension and retirement board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=619)|
| 0:10:29| I'd like to get a I guess a vote on the record or a motion to have this meeting electronically and have a quick roll call vote subject to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=629)|
| 0:10:40| Get a get a motion. I'll look to you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| We have a motion that we conduct this meeting electronically, according to the executive order issued by Governor Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=643)|
| 0:10:52| All right. Thank you. I saw I saw Commissioner Daley raise his hand. So that'll be the second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| So, Madam Clerk, would you please do a roll call vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=657)|

| 0:43:07| For discussion, I'm calling on Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I see Houston and Leigh Ann and Jason, you're all there. Get in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2592)|
| 0:43:21| Jason. First, I want to thank you guys for the time you spent with me this week going over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| I want to let everybody know that I'm not some heartless guy that doesn't want to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| I just want to make sure we're getting the best we can for those that need help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| and the best we can for our taxpayers. You've given me a lot of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| but I did still have a few questions if that would be okay with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| First, you explained the FACT program to me, that that's the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| program. Are those mainly people that are currently in the detention facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| This is Leigh Ann from the Helen Ross McNabb Center. Commissioner, the individuals in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| FACT program are individuals who have been diverted from jail and come through the drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2655)|
| 0:44:23| portion of the program, and then all of them are assessed and offered the community-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| component of the FACT program. That's their admittance into the program. We have a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| very small avenue to get in directly from jail, but there's only been about 8% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| individuals who've come from jail to the FACT community-based program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| Then what is exactly the difference between the FACTS and the just drop-off? You have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| broke down in the information you've given me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| That's a great question. So, one of the things that we wanted to keep from the original design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| was a 24-7, 365 facility that law enforcement could utilize to drop off any individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2700)|
| 0:45:09| who they're encountered with that has a mental illness and one of the nine misdemeanor charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| So, it's a firehouse model. Law enforcement officers can drop them off at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| What we really heard from Commission last year was that we did not have as much of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2719)|
| 0:45:27| community-based component. We sent individuals out for follow-up appointments in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| for discharge appointments, but we ourselves through the program didn't have a community-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| program. So, when we looked at the data from, this was a year ago, we reduced our drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| utilization while we increased the community-based and created that FACT program. So, does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| help answer that question? It's all of the services that there are offered in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| making sure they get case management appointments, making sure the individual's behavioral health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| needs are met, making sure they got medication provided in the own individual's environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| And the average length of stay roughly for the program is 3.5 months. And the ultimate goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| would be to step them down into a lesser intensive service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| And by stay, I would interpret that to mean the treatment time, received treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| And 94... I'm sorry, go ahead, Leigh Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| I was going to say, this is a level of care that didn't currently exist in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| And 94% of the drop-offs to the site are actually done by the Knoxville City Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| You guys are providing all of the community-based services yourself. You're not subbing that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| to anybody or assigning somebody the casework. It's all your all's caseload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| How many case managers do you have dedicated to this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| So, for the community-based element, we have five. We have a few in the drop-off component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| that does a lot of the discharge planning, but we have five that carry the caseloads to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Okay. And two there that work the period of time they're there for the 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| I guess that's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Could you repeat that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| You have five that work in the community-based program out in the community and then two that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| are there at the center for the people during the 24 hours that they are at the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| That is correct, with the additional medical staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| And according to your outpatient treatments, 68% of the people go to follow-up treatments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| They do. So, that is one of the outcomes that we measured from the very beginning of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2876)|
| 0:48:04| So, that measures from everybody who comes to the drop-off center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| whether they kept their initial follow-up appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Is it just a follow-up or is it like we asked last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| And you provided that information, I guess, in order to get the average of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| 10 community-based services over a month, over three and a half months average time of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| So, the 68% is looking at all of the individuals served in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| and did they keep that initial follow-up appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| The 10 visits per month is pulled from all of our community-based data provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| for individuals in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| Okay. I know you've only had this program running a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| I had asked Jason for a copy of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| On our website is the 2018-19 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| That was back when your program was much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| And I wasn't able to get – when do you think you'll have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| Hey, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| I had another meeting at 4 today when we said program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| Someone send that to you after we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| All right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| Leigh Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| I think we all agree that this is just the tip of the iceberg of what we actually need to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| to help people in our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| What is there that you think we could do to improve and make this even better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| Well, as we talked the other day, I think I'm someone who's always looking for improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| I think our organization's always looking for continual improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I know that this is a very challenging and unique segment of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| And we're talking about individuals who – when we first opened this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| we thought we would know most of the individuals that we would see coming through our door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| And to our surprise, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| I think it's a group of individuals that, for a lack of a better description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| are hidden from services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| And we don't – we aren't able to do a very good job accessing them in the past in treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| So we've – it's a very difficult to engage population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| I think housing is always going to be a continual challenge for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| I think continuing to build trust and, you know, I think that happens with intensive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3037)|
| 0:50:46| I think – so this is a – you know, it's a program that's intensive by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| It's a program that's evidence-based by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| And I think it's because of the very difficult population that we're trying to reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| With funding – funding notwithstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| do you think this program works better than the original programming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| You know, I think what we've done is added a community element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| So we didn't really lose anything that I didn't think that we had to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3074)|
| 0:51:23| So what we downsized is the three-day stay at the observation unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| And I've been happily surprised that we've been able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| I feel, to continue to stabilize people within that 23 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| And I think the staff have worked really hard to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| And then I think adding the community-based element has strengthened the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| I fully believe that the community-based program and the follow-up is a lot better way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3105)|
| 0:51:52| I just wanted to make sure that 24 hours is time to stabilize somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| and that we didn't need to go looking to go back to the 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| And, Commissioner, we're very – you know, we are an extremely creative bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| And we want our staff to feel the need to meet the needs of an individual in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| So we have, at times, extended that, if need be, or done whatever we need to do to get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| into additional – more like residential services or things like that on occasion, if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| They've done an excellent job. I'm proud of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Okay. Moving forward, could you provide us with quarterly reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| That would be very helpful, especially as we go into the second year of this format and programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| We can. Do we want to know how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Okay. Is there a – if you will, after the meeting, if we can find the best, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| the route to make sure that you all get that on a quarterly basis, we will absolutely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| You can just send it to the Commission email. Drill will distribute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| You got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Okay. We have a follow-up from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was – I'm still a little confused on how many people we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| serving and at what cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| You want to answer that? I can, or you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| You want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3196)|
| 0:53:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Okay, Commissioner. I'll take that one. Jason's here if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| So, you asked how many people we are serving and to what cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| We serve approximately 500 individuals every year. So, we're in our second year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| We exceeded that last year. We are on target to see that same number this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| Through quarter three, we have served 373 individuals. We look at a daily rate on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3214)|
| 0:53:44| cost of that, and we come up with $31.73. And the way we come up with that is the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3224)|
| 0:53:55| Average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Jason's trying to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3236)|
| 0:53:56| Is that average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| It's the average of the quarter for what we get from you all and we – for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| And then we divide that by the number of individuals served in the program through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| that quarter, and we divide that by the number of treatment days available. And it is a 24-7 model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| So, that's how we come up with that figure, which is significantly less than an average jail day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| stay. I will say that 100% of the individuals have immediate access to mental health treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| and have – 100% have been diverted from jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Okay. And my follow-up question is, do we track by zip code the population of people you serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| or other demographics that will determine where our point of service area is and could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| strengthened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Oh, that's a great question. So, we gather that information on intake. I have not pulled it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| zip code. But that's something we could do. We have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| Yeah. And the reason I was asking that question is – I mean, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| in the middle of a pandemic, are we faced with people who have higher particular stressors or –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| and if we needed to target our case manager associated with that? And have we looked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| add additional supports because of the mental health challenges that we're in the middle of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| So, I just wanted to make sure – I acknowledge that some of the additional stressors are present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| now. And if we're looking to provide additional resources in that direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| I would like to answer that question, if I can, from the organization's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| So, a little separate from this contract, we do provide the Crisis Stabilization Unit and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| Mobile Crisis Unit for this area. And we really wanted to enhance our call line. So, we implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3341)|
| 0:55:49| a little bit additional follow-up for callers if somebody was calling in need or something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| that. We wanted to make sure we provided a call within a week or follow-up to that, just to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| sure people got a little extra support right now. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| Thank you. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Deal. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Earlier, when talking to Commissioner Smith, you said that a rather large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| if not almost entire, percentage of the use of this program is from the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| Knoxville Police Department. Has training, information sharing, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3381)|
| 0:56:28| introductions of all of these programs been given to the County Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| Yes, sir. So, we meet on a monthly basis with representatives from both the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3394)|
| 0:56:42| Office and the Police Department. And I will say that that is an increase from last year. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| that's positive to see. And we review every month how we can increase that number. But I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| there is more to be done. So, we could do more training. We have trained everyone on their shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| but we could certainly do that again and see if that could increase utilization in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| Are you able to tell if the population that's being served by your programs, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| do they inherently come from within the city limits? Or is there a group of people outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| of the city limits that you feel like are just not finding their way here? Or is there a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| to know that? You know, I don't know. So, here, I'm just going to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| they're being brought to us by the Police Department. So, I'm making some assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| that they're in that area to be arrested. But we haven't looked at their zip code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| as Commissioner Gill mentioned, about where they would consider identifying as their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Okay. Thank you very much. So, that's something we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Yeah, I think it's worth trying to understand. And I appreciate that there's a lot of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| going on on the county side as well as the city to get people more engaged and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| understanding what this resource is available to use. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| Yeah, thank you. Go ahead, Commissioner Daley. And then I might have a quick follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| What is the city's portion is my only question of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| I was jumping in there. Jason's pushing me forward. Hello, everyone. Last Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Knoxville City Council unanimously approved their portion of this contract extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| It's probably worth mentioning that this is a single contract with the city and with Helen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| Ross McNabb with the county. And that total dollar amount was for $470,000. I'm sorry, $575,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3516)|
| 0:58:48| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To follow up on Commissioner Daley's comment. So, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| is kicking in 40% and we're kicking in 60%. Why was it not a 50-50 proposition for both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3540)|
| 0:59:09| governmental bodies? I would love to answer that for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| Commissioner. But that would be between the county finance director and the city finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| I think I can answer that. Go ahead. The premise and thought was it would save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3563)|
| 0:59:32| the county money on jail days in the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3572)|
| 0:59:42| Okay. All right. Thank you. Commissioner Skinmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| any follow up or any other follow up from Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Leanne, you know I don't like that $31 a day how it breaks down because it makes some assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| I'm a bean counter. So, I'm going to just break this into a very simple way so that people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| get an idea of the program. With the city and the county combined, it's a $1,415,000 a year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3605)|
| 1:00:14| If you divide that by the average number of patients a year of 500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| it comes out to about $2,830 per person served. And if you do that by a day count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| it costs the program $3,876 a day to operate. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3625)|
| 1:00:36| Hey, I've got one. Commissioner Smith, your light's still on. And I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| Houston, if you all want to respond to that or I mean, those numbers appear to be what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| I'll take the first stab at answering that. I think that what I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| about these programs are that they are 24-7. So, I think it's important to remember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| in order for law enforcement to feel like they can drop off, we have to make sure that we make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| for them where it's least amount of barriers. So, we are open 24-7, 365. They can bring an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| individual in at any time. So, we are housing that, we're staffing that 365. And firehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| models are a set cost and we have the beds for that. So, the FACT community-based portion is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| a 24-7, 365 model due to us wanting to make sure we got an evidence-based practice model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3691)|
| 1:01:40| for this population, which really means you have to have people available 24-7 for the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| So, it's hard to look at that based like on a fee-for-service model. So, it's important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| in order for us to be successful, if we want to go back to designing a program that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| successful with the individuals that we're working with, we have got to be available when they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| it. And when they need it is when they're in front of a police officer, when they're at risk of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| to the emergency department, when they're having issues in the community and we need a place for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| them to be extracted to or out of a situation. So, I think that's, I would just like to describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3735)|
| 1:02:24| that as what the level of programming that we're offering for this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3744)|
| 1:02:32| Any other follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| All right. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you, Chairman Nostrom. My question is actually for Commissioner Smith. Given some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| of the things he was talking about and the data he was providing and the facts and figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| is he suggesting we kind of pull out of this program or pull back on some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| our funds or what would he like to see that's not there or things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| Mr. Biggs, Commissioner Biggs, no, that's not what I'm suggesting. I am just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| this is a, you know, it was a pilot program. It ran a year the way we kind of envisioned it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3783)|
| 1:03:12| State throws its curveball. We're having to run it another way. I'm just trying to get a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| knowledge of it. I don't think you pull the plug on anything after one year. I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3797)|
| 1:03:24| I honestly think they're trying and doing a good job. It's a really tough job. I'm just trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| make sure that this is working the best that it can and trying to let everybody realize how hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| this is and how much more effort we need to start putting into these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| But I did have, well, I'm-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| You actually had your hand up. Do you want to just finish your question and then I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| move? I know Commissioner Jay wanted to have a follow-up as well and I might too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| Okay. And I did want to ask about the facility itself. I know it's a 10,000 square foot facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| I know we're down to six beds there and that we have some medical staff there and it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3835)|
| 1:04:03| we have maybe two in-house and five off-premises counselors, master counselors, I believe you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3843)|
| 1:04:14| called them. What type of space in that facility is dedicated to this portion of the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| Commissioner Smith, we can get that exact number. My guess is about 40% of that square footage at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| least is specific to the site. If you add in the break room and the intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| just all the aspects that are dedicated to the BHUC, I'd say it's more than 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| Okay. And none of the space has been lost to the expansion of the crisis stabilization unit, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| I think that's going to be the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| That's it from me, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Okay. Commissioner Jay, I've just got a quick, I know you'd already had gone already. I know when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| we were evaluating and planning on moving into space and we looked at programs all around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| country trying to figure out who was getting the best outcomes. I remember, I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| studying a program in Arizona or I mean, there was a whole bunch of different program models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| I guess I'm curious, are we hearing from anybody outside of our market asking us about what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| doing? And when you guys are networking within this space, talking about the outcomes that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3926)|
| 1:05:33| getting and the investment in it, can you just give me a quick recap on how are we doing? It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| hard to compare to our peers because I get there's probably very different programs that are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| done differently. And I don't want this to go on for too long, so if you could just kind of be brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| I'll answer that one, sir. Yes, we are. So when you look across the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| we are part of a diversion group that meet regularly and they're all a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| I would say ours is a very true jail diversion. So these aren't individuals who are at risk of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| going to jail or if services aren't provided, they may go to jail. They are on their way to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| So I think that makes our community really unique because it has to be a good relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| from your mental health provider, your law enforcement providers, your district attorney's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| office, all having to work really closely together. So I'm proud of that. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| other communities don't necessarily see that as well. We have been on webinars for some federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| agencies. So for SAMHSA, the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| has our staff regularly on webinars to teach other communities about this model and what's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| working, our challenges, our redesign, being very interested. What I hear is they're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4007)|
| 1:06:56| envious of what we've been able to do in our community. And there are other models across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| the state are looking to do this. Our CEO and I went to a complex care conference this year to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| talk about this model on a panel with people from New York, wanting to know how we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| successful with the true jail diversion piece. They are very interested in us establishing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| community-based component. Many of them don't have that component to it. So that's been interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| So we've gotten a lot of attention and press across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| They're very interested in watching for what our outcomes are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| Is it, as someone who did spend some time in the social work sphere, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| is it too early to really have a whole lot of data to do a real outcome model where you've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| say, a control group or anything? I mean, it's got to be difficult, especially with the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| in the program. When we look back on this in a year or so, I guess I want to find out kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| yeah, I won't be on this body anymore, but I guess we want to keep your message real simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| in terms of the outcomes. It's also difficult, I realize right now, our jail population has dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| And that normally you would say, well, here's one of the outcomes that we've gotten. How much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| of the jail population drop has been contributed by your program and some of the other factors? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| I guess that's some data. I don't expect you to have it. You probably don't. But as we begin to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| move forward, that could be some relevant and interesting data to see how the program contributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| to the drop in population. Yeah, thank you. And I would also say what I think would be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| interesting for us to look at, it's the number of jail bed days prior to the program and post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| So even if we've been able to not have an individual return to jail six months post-discharge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| it really doesn't paint the picture of how many jail bed days they had the year prior and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| year post. We've had some individuals with up to 30 arrests in a previous year. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| All right. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a question. Do we know if, I don't believe I've ever heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| of a program like this in any of our surrounding counties. Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| I don't think so. The closest that we operate, Commissioner, is our early release program for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| women that are coming out of the Hamblin County Jail in Morristown. It's a very successful program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| but it's not a diversion. It's an early release program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| I guess my question is, are residents from other counties being brought or participating in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| program and are we receiving any support from our surrounding counties if this is sort of a regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| model or a regional hub? Is it a regional model or hub or is it truly Knox County only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| that is using it? It is truly Knox County only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| Okay. All right. So that's one of the sort of program qualifications, so to speak. We're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| having people brought in from other surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| No, we are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Okay. Thank you. That's good information. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Okay. Thank you. All right. Are there any other questions or follow-up on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| Okay. Not seeing any. All right. The motion is properly before us, I believe. The motion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| made by Commissioner Anders with the second by Commissioner Gill, if that's correct. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| all in favor, please say aye via a roll call vote. Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4219)|

| 1:10:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| Commissioner Bessler votes aye. Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4256)|

| 1:11:09| All right. Thank you. It passes. Okay. Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| On page 9, item number 41, consideration of a resolution of the commission declaring Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:24| County, Tennessee, a second amendment constitutional county. This is resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| Okay. Thank you. Can I get a motion prior to discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| All right. We have from the original makers of this one, we have a motion for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| from Commissioner Daly and a second from Commissioner Beeler with Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| has got his light on. Commissioner Anders, you recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I expressed my concerns about an amendment that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4313)|
| 1:12:00| you know, the law director says this is a political statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| The makers of the motion have both said it has no teeth. It has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| justification, no law. I had a few constituents email me and say this is not a matter for county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4329)|
| 1:12:17| commission. We're going through the biggest financial struggle of our generation and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| worried about making a group of people whom I agree with happy. And then, you know, last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4341)|
| 1:12:31| the makers of the motion, the sponsors of the motion, you know, said this is about you swore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| an oath to uphold the constitution of the country, the federal constitution, the state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| the town charter. And, you know, we sat in the last beer board meeting and the two makers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| the motion refused to vote on a lawful beer permit because they don't believe in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| And so when another commissioner brings another topic that is law that you don't agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| as a maker of the motion or as being divisive, I mean, we're creating divisive issues at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4380)|
| 1:13:09| where we need to be together on everything. And I just, I mean, I'll vote for it in support of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| because I support the second amendment. But this kind of activism and this kind of thing is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| got us previous to 2008 on our county commission, fighting each other and the unprofessionalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| that we saw there. And although the hearts rot, the intents rot, I mean, if you don't believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| the county charter and the beer laws and you can't vote for those, then don't sit here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| you guys need to uphold the constitution of the federal constitution of the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| I just think it's a sitting a bad precedent. It's unnecessary. The county can't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| to the federal government. They won't do anything to the federal government, nor the state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| And so it's just divisive to stuff that, I mean, I agree with the content of the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4430)|
| 1:13:58| but it has no political, or it has no bearing on how we function as a county. And if you can't vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| for the charter of Knox County as small as something as a beer permit, because you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4444)|

| 1:14:16| supporting it as the law of the country, which it is, don't defer on that. So I think the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| that we're sending is unnecessary. It has no bearing and it's a political statement. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| unfortunate that we went down this path. Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| Next, Commissioner Gill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And considering I was the only commissioner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| vote against this, this is a political move. And unfortunately in the middle of a pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| we understand that there was lots of opposition sent by email. And I want to acknowledge and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| make sure we understand that there was opposition to this and that the federal government and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| state and local government should be one, because obviously if you understood and read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4500)|
| 1:15:09| constitution, we would not even be in this position. And that I think that the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4509)|

| 1:15:23| versus a resolution that is looking at making this a second amendment county. It is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| simply unnecessary. And I just want to make sure the voice of the people who spoke against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| be acknowledged. And when I first started, I had another commissioner tell me to stay in my lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| when I wanted to support all of the employees that were being furloughed at the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| of Tennessee. And I think part of the message that is missing because we are on Zoom is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| public telling us to stay in our lane. And I want to make sure that this is an unnecessary resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4555)|
| 1:16:03| on considering some of the level of unprofessionalism that has been hurled at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| that we need to acknowledge this is not where we need to be. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4571)|
| 1:16:19| All right. Sorry, Commissioner Jay. Check the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| Sorry about that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If you'll permit, I just put together a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| I just wanted to sort of gather my thoughts together if you'll allow me a minute to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| I've spent a lot of time researching and reading about this movement and to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| counties like ours declare themselves a Second Amendment sanctuary county. I've also received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| equal numbers of responses from constituents supporting and opposing us. In full disclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| I am a gun owner, an avid bird hunter, and a law-abiding citizen. I've never felt like my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4607)|

| 1:17:16| such as self-defense within the home. Last week, Commissioner Beeler stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| this is a resolution. This resolution is a statement that we don't welcome any laws that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| would change the Second Amendment. A governing body may not welcome new gun laws, but any federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4645)|

| 1:18:14| on this resolution. Here are some of the statements that were presented. Commissioner Daley stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| this is not a problem solver at all. This is just a statement. This resolution has no teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| related to any law. It's not going to change any laws or change anything. Our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4704)|

| 1:18:34| by the state. We don't have any regulatory rights on a local level related to guns. It's a political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| statement more than a legal statement. We don't have any jurisdiction at all. We are saying we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| support the federal law and the state law as written. When I took the oath of office, I swore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| that I would support, obey, and defend the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4729)|

| 1:18:58| discharge the duties of my office to the best of my ability. I didn't swear to uphold some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| or the ones I agree with, but all of them equally. And I take that very seriously. I take very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4743)|

| 1:19:12| politics. Last week, Commissioner Daley stated, the law department has spent hours on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| resolution. By that statement, it's clear that Knox County has already spent real money on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| exercise that has no legal merit, solves no problems, and affirms something we already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| I hope this isn't the beginning of a trend where we continue to spend more taxpayer funds on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| singling out items we already attest to. Commissioner Bussler stated, people want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| know where you stand. That's a fair statement. So I want to be very clear to the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4777)|

| 1:20:10| and label it the single most important issue. If this resolution, by admissions from its sponsors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| has no legal merit and solves no problems, its only purpose can be political by nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4815)|

| 1:22:19| Okay. I'll call Commissioner Bessler. I appreciate the information that we got about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4939)|

| 1:22:41| states that you go into that you have to call and register. If you're caught with that, it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| felony in their state to have a carry permit, even though you've got a carry permit in the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4967)|

| 1:23:08| And it just depends upon who's in office and in the state and in that state of how things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4988)|
| 1:23:16| are litigated. So I see both sides of the story. But if it was legal under this Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=4996)|
| 1:23:29| we should be able to have a carry permit that's good for the whole United States, but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| because each people limit your constitutional rights. California, New York, Illinois,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5014)|

| 1:23:47| and you've got to have it locked up when you go in there. So yeah, I can see we have a Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5027)|
| 1:23:57| but we're not all equal in every state to carry that gun, even though you may have a permit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| carry it. So one way or the other, you're going to have to make a statement. Hey, we believe in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| and we're going to have it free and open for everybody to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| and to protect themselves from an overbearing government. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5051)|
| 1:24:19| look at the rest of the states, what they do. So that's all I've got to say about it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| Steve Adkins All right. Thanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Commissioner Bussler. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| Commissioner Daley sending us the information about the other counties in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| I took a look at the document that Commissioner Daley sent us, and I noticed that for the Eastern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5078)|
| 1:24:46| Grand Division of Tennessee, which is the 33 counties in East Tennessee, 25 of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5086)|
| 1:24:55| commissions out of the 33 have already passed a resolution similar to this. So basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5095)|
| 1:25:03| 75 percent of our neighboring counties have passed this resolution. So it tells me, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5103)|
| 1:25:12| that the law directors in those 25 counties have also previewed this type of resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5112)|
| 1:25:20| and have approved it, and our colleagues have as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| Steve Adkins All right. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| Commissioner Daley Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| have got some phone calls and some emails from constituents, but most of them, I will say the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5136)|
| 1:25:43| vast majority of them are for this 2A. And this is, I've been called a few names, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5143)|
| 1:25:52| I mean, that's what you want to do. You can call me names or you can do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| But this is not a political grandstand. This was some citizens that came to me and asked me if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| would sponsor this, I believe, in the Second Amendment. And to do this, I asked the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| department, the law department looked at this, the law department, and I set hours. The law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| department didn't spend hours on that one, you know. The most important thing is that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5173)|
| 1:26:24| a nation of rules and laws. And I understand that, you know, I'm picking the 2A because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| I was requested to. And I am going to vote for it. It's up to you. If you don't want to vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5190)|
| 1:26:37| don't vote for it. It's something that I feel that was brought before my attention back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5197)|
| 1:26:44| January or February, I believe. And we could have heard it then, but we postponed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| for 30 days or 60 days. So I see nothing wrong with supporting the Second Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5210)|
| 1:27:00| as Knox County, and I will vote to support that Knox County 2A amendment. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| thank you, Commissioner Beeler, for signing on to that, this resolution. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5227)|
| 1:27:14| be what it is. You know, you can say I'm grandstanding. You can say that it's not necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| but that's your opinion. But, you know, I was done what I was asked to do. It's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| that I believe in. And so thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Beeler, for help supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5247)|
| 1:27:34| Okay. Thanks, Commissioner Daley. Commissioner Anders, I see your light still on. I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| give you another second to weigh in here. Okay, you're just turning your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| Yeah, I'll be clear. I've kind of been on the struggle bus on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| I remember when we talked about it at the work session last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| my friend Commissioner Beeler had said, you know, he's a preacher. You know, he really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| I don't even know if you own a gun or been that active in it, but found himself as a co-sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| of this one. When, you know, I'm frankly just the opposite. You know, when I'm not fishing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| you know, this is one of my hobbies. I like to collect and shoot and bird hunt. And I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| trophies. You can't see them, but there's some trophies up there for my, for some success in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| that one. But, you know, where, what's made me struggle on this one is just the whole classic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| staying in your lanes and getting involved in federal issues at the county level. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| has made this, you know, not the seeming no-brainer that it is. And much like Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| I've had a lot of citizens had approached me earlier in the year and said, hey, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| do this? I said, guys, I said, no, I'm just, I'm busy as chairman. I'm focusing on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| and prefer, you know, that's more of a federal issue than a local issue. Although I have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| for a number of months, just kind of following how it's been hitting in some of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| counties around here. As you look at the law, you know, as I mentioned somewhat tongue in cheek at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| the work session, it was an awfully long resolution. You know, the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| case in that is the Heller case. I think Mr. Jay mentioned that, which, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5344)|
| 1:29:10| kind of validated it. And where I guess I've also struggled is, you know, where we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| budgetary stuff in a document that is mentioned as a primarily an honorary resolution. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| so I guess, you know, where I've struggled most is the vote. You know, I'd have a hard time voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| against it. You know, I don't know that I could, but where I would struggle is do I pass on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| vote? You know, I'm still, you know, that's what I've really been struggling a lot on is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| because I've always tried to keep our meetings simple, clean, and not get too deeply involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| in federal issues here locally. So those are some of my general thoughts. And believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| I've been more involved in the community in support of this than many of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| because it's been a competitive thing for me. So, you know, with that said, I wanted to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5393)|
| 1:30:00| some of the other commissioners a chance to weigh in on it. And I sometimes not see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| other lights, so I can probably hand it over to, unless some of the other commissioners wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| to speak, hand it back to, okay, Smith. Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've struggled with this, too, because I am a supporter of gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5414)|
| 1:30:23| owners' rights and the right to bear arms. I, along with you, have a problem when it gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5423)|
| 1:30:31| into budgetary questions and a problem where we start to make things that we have no control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| local divisions, things that divide people in our community when it really is for no reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5439)|
| 1:30:48| because it has no teeth and means nothing. You know, I struggle with do I pass, do I vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| this? You know, I feel like I have to vote for it. Like anything that's the law of our land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| part of our charter, part of our state constitution, I feel like I have to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| I'm wondering if there's any other, anything we can do to shorten this to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| less complicated. That is one long resolution. If there's anything we can do to simplify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5474)|
| 1:31:22| And, again, I really don't like things that don't come, that come before us that we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5482)|
| 1:31:31| have no control over. And everybody's used this phrase a lot tonight. I remember my good friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| Sam McKenzie telling us this all the time when he was on commission. Stay in your lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5497)|
| 1:31:47| Okay. Well, I can't guarantee this is the end of the discussion on this item. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| if somebody wanted to amend it, I'm sure that could happen. But I do want to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| Commissioner Beeler a chance to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, for the record, I do own a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| guns, not as a gun enthusiast by any means. I really wanted to speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5528)|
| 1:32:16| you know, just a couple of things that have been said by my colleagues. And by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| I respect everything that's been said. You know, I know what's been said in a respectful way. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| I know none of it's personal. But I wanted to speak to a couple of things. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| first of all, this resolution has absolutely nothing to do with my concern or action in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5547)|
| 1:32:38| of helping navigate Knox County through this financial crisis. They're completely unrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| This resolution was worked on and crafted before the COVID crisis hit us and has been deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5565)|
| 1:32:54| since we have been having our meetings on Zoom. So the timing was certainly not intended the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| that it's turned out. In terms of the positions that I've taken on beer board votes, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5582)|
| 1:33:10| speak to that too. I absolutely 100% respect every person business owners right under the laws of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5590)|
| 1:33:19| Knox County in the state of Tennessee to obtain a beer permit if they meet all the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| For that reason, I do not believe I have ever voted against anyone receiving a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| who met the criteria. I simply have a moral conviction, moral conviction when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| alcohol that has caused me to feel like passing when possible has been the best course of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5618)|
| 1:33:49| for me. Otherwise, I couldn't serve. The other thing I want to speak to was, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5629)|
| 1:33:57| political intent behind this. Is it political? Of course, it's political. And I'll say why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5637)|
| 1:34:05| You know, the Constitution and especially the original articles in the Bill of Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| I have a when it comes to that, I take a very strict constructionist view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| meaning that it says what it means and it means what it says. It is not open to new interpretations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| If it needs to be changed, it can be amended, but not reinterpreted. And the reason I say that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| because for the original articles and the Bill of Rights, we have more than two centuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| of established legal precedent from the Supreme Court as to what these things mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| Well-established. And yet, we have incredible differences of opinion in certain municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5678)|
| 1:34:48| and even states when it comes to the Second Amendment. I even had a constituent very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| respectfully say to me that while they don't like this resolution, they support the Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| Amendment because they believe that you should be able to have a gun in your house to defend your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| home. And, you know, that sounds reasonable. I have had others who have said, not constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5700)|
| 1:35:09| but I have heard others who have said they don't believe the Second Amendment ascribes any rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| to private citizens to own weapons at all or guns at all. There are even some municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| and states, for instance, in the state of New York, a court case about 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| the New York Supreme Court said that the only way to get a carry-conceal permit in New York is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| prove that you need special protection. So, you know, all three of those views might sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| reasonable to one group of people or the other, but they are simply not what 200 years of legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| precedent has said the Second Amendment means. The Second Amendment is a far more broad right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| of law-abiding citizens to bear arms. And if I were a judge or a lawyer, that would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5749)|
| 1:35:58| a legal opinion. Because I am a legislator, it's considered a political opinion. But I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| one that's important enough to state. I believe it's one that's important enough even for a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| to state that, hey, you know what, this is our position. We believe in strict construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| of the Constitution. And, you know, no, not every single person does. But in a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| that's what we believe. We believe that the Second Amendment should be viewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| in the way 200 years of established legal precedent has said it should be viewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| Not as some municipality somewhere may say that it should be viewed. But that legal precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| has established it should be viewed. You know, is it something we shouldn't do? I respect your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| heart. If that's what you think it's something that's out of our lane, I get that. And that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| not mean to me that you don't support the Second Amendment. But I think statements like this are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| being made by municipalities, counties, and states, even states across our country. I believe Oregon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| is one. And I think it's worth, it's a statement worth making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Buehler. Commissioner Anders, I see you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| would like to weigh in again. Yes, sir. Question for the law director. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| Mr. Law Director, if you don't mind, on the top paragraph of page four of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| The Board will not authorize appropriate government funds, resources, employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| agencies, contractors, buildings, or offices for the purpose of enforcing or assisting any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| enforcement of any such acts. And then it goes on to talk about keeping bear arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5847)|
| 1:37:36| the United States Supreme Court. So if the law changes, again, this resolution is a moot point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5856)|
| 1:37:44| anyway. I'm not saying the law is going to change. I don't think it ever will. But and so is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| I mean, so is this saying that the county is going to be against what is currently the Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| Amendment if the law changes? No, this says that you're going to be for what the Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| Amendment is. You're enumerating some of those elements as it currently is. If the law changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5882)|
| 1:38:10| of course, any law, whether it be state or federal law, can always supersede the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| an ordinance, or a resolution when that change occurs. It's an automatic thing. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5896)|
| 1:38:23| every vote for any particular thing is in a moment of time. And it survives as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5903)|
| 1:38:30| a superior law that doesn't conflict with it. Because under our charter, we have to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| alignment with federal and state law. Okay. And so if, can we be sued for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5916)|
| 1:38:43| resolutions? Can the county, is there a lot, I mean, is there damages or anything that somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| can claim that? Can somebody take the county to court for that? Well, people take the county court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5926)|
| 1:38:55| for anything they feel like they do. But you have qualified immunity in terms of your legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| powers. And, you know, winning it would be an entirely different thing. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5941)|
| 1:39:09| Okay. I mean, I see if there's any other discussion on that one. I mean, I guess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| was one of the biggest challenges in this whole resolution was the, it talks about us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| budgetary impact on that one, that we would not authorize or appropriate any kind of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5962)|
| 1:39:30| Had it been up to me, you know, you probably could have written this in one page and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| mentioned any budget. I saw a few weeks ago when I realized this was going to be in our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| a month ago when I saw this is going to be on our agenda. I know I saw all sorts of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| resolutions that other counties had passed. Not all of them were so lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| But this kind of is what it is. So that said, is there any other discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=5991)|
| 1:40:02| Okay. All right. Madam Clerk, could you do a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-business?start=6002)|
