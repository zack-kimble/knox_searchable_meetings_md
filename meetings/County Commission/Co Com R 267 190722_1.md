| 2:12:19| It's primarily low residential and agricultural area at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7939)|
| 2:12:26| Also, with the cemetery being right across the street, which is the East Tennessee Veterans Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7946)|
| 2:12:37| we'd like to keep that area uninhibited so that it would continue to honor our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7957)|
| 2:12:52| As indicated, this plan is not consistent with the South County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7972)|
| 2:12:59| and it is in conflict with the existing general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7979)|
| 2:13:07| As I said, hopefully we can preserve some of the scenic designation of John Speer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7987)|
| 2:13:14| by keeping some low-density residential and agricultural on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Thank you so much. Mr. Valiant, your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| You've got one more back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| Oh, you've got one more. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| I'd said six minutes, two, three, four, five, so you've got about three minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| We'll make sure everybody gets heard. We're not here to deny anybody the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| I'm just trying to kind of â€“ and there'll be questions as well, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| My name is Jim Sliman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| I represent Crosswalk Community Church at 2131 East Governor John Speer Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8026)|
| 2:13:53| Our church building is on about 13 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| and we abut the property that you're considering tonight for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8036)|
| 2:14:05| We oppose the zoning mainly for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8045)|
| 2:14:11| One is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Our church, as well as the property you're considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| is roughly three-and-a-half miles to Chapman Highway if you go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| If you go the other way, we're three-and-a-half miles to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| And here's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| As you get from those highways on to John Speer Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| you're slowed down with about three traffic lights going one of the ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| and you're slowed down by three more traffic lights going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8077)|
| 2:14:42| So here's what happens, because I travel that way all the time, and this is my church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8082)|
| 2:14:47| When you get on to John Speer Highway, it's natural that you can only go so fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8087)|
| 2:14:53| because in about a mile you're going to hit a red light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| and then another mile or half mile you get another red light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| and there are intersections there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| There are service stations, there are crossroads, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| Now what happens after that third light, though, as you pass it, here's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8104)|
| 2:15:10| As you speed up, it's just natural that you've got a mile or two-mile stretch between those two lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8110)|
| 2:15:17| Unfortunately, as the lady has mentioned, you come into a big curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| And by the way, you come into a curve on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| It's particularly bad on the curve going toward Chapman Highway, and it's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8125)|
| 2:15:32| At some point, somebody's going to have to think about a red light or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| There are two incidents at our church where somebody almost got hit pulling out of our church after church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8136)|
| 2:15:42| and you wouldn't think there'd be that much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| But what happens is traffic speeds up on those two curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| Interesting enough, there is a turning lane, whereas most of the highway doesn't have a turning lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8149)|
| 2:15:56| We actually have a turning lane into those curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| The problem there is people not only want to use that to turn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| they want to use it to pass in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| Of course, they're not supposed to do that, but that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| Now, the other reason is the area has very little land that can be used residentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8170)|
| 2:16:25| When I say residentially, I mean for apartments, condos, duplexes, and houses, the whole spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| There's very little land there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| Coming around the curve, coming to our church, you're passing the French Broad River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8194)|
| 2:16:43| and you're passing the gravel landfill that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8203)|
| 2:16:50| There's just not much left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| Once this goes, then we basically have nothing but industrial and commercial for that highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8212)|
| 2:16:58| I will tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| It's not a Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| It's not a Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| Nothing like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| It's just not that kind of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| It needs to stay residential or agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| The chair will now recognize Mr. Valiant for the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| Joanna Toole is going to be handing out two handouts to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| One of them shows an aerial view of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8242)|
| 2:17:27| and the other one shows a rendering of the building that we're planning on putting on that particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8247)|
| 2:17:37| The business that's involved in this is a small family-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8257)|
| 2:17:44| Mr. Toole has, for a few years now, done erosion control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8264)|
| 2:17:51| The business has grown so much that he now has to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| He was, in fact, on the farm next to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| But the requirements of his business, he's got to expand some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| This is not a big, noxious building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| He doesn't have a lot of traffic coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| The site's being used for his men to gather and then leave and go out and do their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| He does work for DOE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| He does work for KEB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| He does work for other utility districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| And he's got an environmental stewardship contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8303)|
| 2:18:32| So we're talking about a low-impact business that he's willing to put on four acres there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| and also screen it to the extent that this commission is wanting him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8319)|
| 2:18:50| The problem with this particular tract as it's set forth in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8330)|
| 2:18:58| and the general plan is it shows it to be low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| Well, sector plans and general plans are for the purpose of covering large areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| but they're not considering the usefulness of that particular zoning for a tract of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| This tract of land is, I think, something like 18 acres, but he's only wanting to use four of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8354)|
| 2:19:22| Directly across the river is an active quarry, which you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| It's American limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| There's active dynamiting going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8370)|
| 2:19:35| And part of this land is covered by a flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8375)|
| 2:19:42| Realistically speaking, nobody is going to purchase a residence across from a mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8382)|
| 2:19:52| or a mining operation where there's dynamiting going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| In any realistic sense, this cannot be used or it's not practical to use it to build homes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8397)|
| 2:20:05| It just won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| Even though the general plan and the sector plan call for it, it's not reasonably feasible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8408)|
| 2:20:19| Now, in order to get this changed, I think I've stated what our reason is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8419)|
| 2:20:29| There is, to change a sector plan, you have to show that there is obvious and significant error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8429)|
| 2:20:40| Well, I think that the fact that this plan does not consider the fact that certain aspects of areas in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8440)|
| 2:20:50| cannot possibly be used for what they have designated it for is an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| This particular tract, you could build a house on it, but you couldn't sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8456)|
| 2:21:03| Nobody is going to buy a house across from a blasting operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| Now, with regard to the, there's also a change, which the lady spoke to, a cemetery had gone in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8466)|
| 2:21:13| which itself has increased the traffic along Johnsonville Highway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8473)|
| 2:21:21| This business is not going to do anything to really substantially increase any traffic because it's not that kind of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8481)|
| 2:21:32| So we would ask that you allow Mr. Toole to zone his property as requested to CR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8492)|
| 2:21:41| And if you have any questions, one of us will be here to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8501)|
| 2:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8510)|
| 2:21:51| We've got multiple lights on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| I had my head down on the map a little bit, so I'm going to go in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| Anders Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8518)|
| 2:21:59| So it was you were the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8519)|
| 2:22:00| So Anders Carringer Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| And is that Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8525)|
| 2:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8526)|
| 2:22:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8529)|
| 2:22:10| Go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8532)|
| 2:22:13| Mr. Green, question, and you may not know the answer to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| What was the original zoning or sector plan prior to the, and when was the last update of the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8534)|
| 2:22:21| I think this was back 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| And I don't know what the sector plan designation in the old sector plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8548)|
| 2:22:29| And did the original request include all ten acres, or did it just include four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| I'm trying to, I'll have to look to Mr. Toole or Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| The original request was actually for more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| What I think Mr. Toole actually did was just draw a line, and it turned out that it was, what, seven or eight acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8563)|
| 2:22:52| Seven or eight acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| But that's, he doesn't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| So, I mean, he's willing to take four, and he's willing to screen it, the four acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8575)|
| 2:23:00| and he can put whatever kind of screen anybody wants on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| And is there any other zoning that would fit that use, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| That's the least intense that would fit that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| And one of the challenges that we have to look at, whereas Mr. Toole's business may be appropriate there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8594)|
| 2:23:20| even this zoning allows service stations, convenience stores, and we look at the long range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8600)|
| 2:23:27| what's going to happen when Mr. Toole outgrows this spot and the zoning stays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8607)|
| 2:23:34| It makes it challenging to address some of the issues that were raised about the compatibility of this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8614)|
| 2:23:40| because we have to look at all the uses permitted in that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| And so are there restrictions that can be placed on the zoning that setbacks and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| I mean, because I feel, in my opinion, I think what we're doing is we're taking a piece of property that is on a state road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8631)|
| 2:24:00| where commercial surrounds it on, you know, I mean, if you look at Fresenius a couple of miles away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| it was a sector plan change and it is in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| All the same arguments, but 12 or 11 of us thought it was a good idea for Fresenius to be rezoned because it brought jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| And I feel like we may be denying someone the best and highest and best use of their property by denying this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8658)|
| 2:24:27| And so I'm trying to find a way to make this work because I do feel like, as a citizen and an owner of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8667)|
| 2:24:36| with the floodplain and I'm sure that the flooding zone increased with the latest digitized technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8676)|
| 2:24:43| I'm sure he lost some of his land use based on the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| And I'm going to look to Mr. Sanders to assist with the answer to your question about conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8688)|
| 2:24:54| I think as long as they are design related and not use, we can't restrict the uses or add uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8694)|
| 2:25:00| I'll look to Mr. Sanders on this one as an idea of requiring use on review approval of any development plan for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8700)|
| 2:25:09| to ensure that issues such as access, buffers, landscaping are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| And I'll look again to Mr. Sanders to see if that might be an option that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| I'll probably have some other questions later, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| Do you want to address that, Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| It's at the pleasure of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| Commissioner Andrews, you originally bubbled that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| Would you like Mr. Sanders to go ahead and address that or we can move on with some of the other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| No, I just wanted to, I mean, I have a thought on a motion that I'd like to make, but I want to hear the rest of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| But I think that we risk not allowing someone to use their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| We've already increased the flood plain based on government standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| and I just think we need to be careful because we've set precedent in other places on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8751)|
| 2:25:56| Okay. I'll go ahead and recognize Mr. Sanders from the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8756)|
| 2:26:00| Excuse me, Mr. Sanders. I thought you said commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| So before we get to the specific question that Commissioner Andrews raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8763)|
| 2:26:11| I do want to note for the commission that this is one of those where a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| and a rezoning have moved in tandem and the planning commission denied the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8775)|
| 2:26:23| So what you have here in front of you is an appeal of a denial of a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8783)|
| 2:26:29| Before you can act on the rezoning, you have to pass a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| but you don't have a sector plan amendment that the planning commission initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| The option here is you've got two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| You could deny the rezoning or you could initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8802)|
| 2:26:48| But you can't grant the rezoning until you have a sector plan amendment in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8808)|
| 2:26:53| that makes the sector plan and the general plan consistent with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| We've got at least two more meetings before you can pass the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| one meeting at the planning commission and then a return to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8822)|
| 2:27:07| So we've done this in the past where a commission initiates a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8827)|
| 2:27:13| and then it goes to MPC for 60 days and then comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| And you'll have the sector plan amendment and the rezoning here at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| You act on the sector plan amendment first and then you act on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| So there's a little bit more time to answer some of the more specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| that commissioners may have between now and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| if it's the desire of commission to move forward with the rezoning or if there's any inkling of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| And I apologize for moving quickly to trying to find some resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8856)|
| 2:27:43| I apologize for not clarifying, as Mr. Sanders said, that this would be a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| If the commission does feel that a rezoning is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| that a sector plan amendment has to be initiated first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| Just trying to find a solution that works for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| I understand. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Next person, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| I think what Ms. Toole handed out to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| is this exactly the building that you would like to build for your business out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8893)|
| 2:28:24| Yes. That hadn't been architecturally drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| That's what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| Okay. And it looks more to me like a private barn that may have horses sitting out on some property and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8911)|
| 2:28:41| So you said that your employees, so here again, this is another business that we're having employees work at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8921)|
| 2:28:51| They would come in the morning and, I guess, get their trucks and then come back in in the afternoons, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| And that's more of a Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| That's not Saturdays and Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| I want to go back to last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| Commissioner Gill and I, and I want to think somebody, maybe Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| There was another commissioner out there with us last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8953)|
| 2:29:18| And was it at your church, Crosswalk, where we had the meeting about the community with all of the blasting and all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8958)|
| 2:29:28| Was that at Crosswalk Church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| That was at another church, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| And what we were hearing, and the reason why we were meeting out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| was the residents out there that had their homes and had had their homes out there for years and on the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8980)|
| 2:29:48| was very upset with the blasting going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8988)|
| 2:29:56| And it was causing a lot of disturbance with people's homes and shaking things and knocking things off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=8996)|
| 2:30:04| And they were even having some, almost kind of like earthquake things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| And the people were very, very upset with the blasting and with the American limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9009)|
| 2:30:17| And so going back to what Brad Anders, or Commissioner Anders, said, that we'd be denying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9017)|
| 2:30:25| there would nowhere be the big tractor and trailers coming in and out like they are at Fresenius, which is right on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9025)|
| 2:30:34| And as far as landing out for church, I know, and I have the, I mean, our churches and most churches, my church and most churches around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9034)|
| 2:30:45| I've noticed that live on heavy roads as Kingston Pike and John Sevier or Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9045)|
| 2:30:56| We all have paid officers that go in direct traffic to get us in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9056)|
| 2:31:03| So I don't think the security or safety is something that we could deny on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9063)|
| 2:31:11| And as far as having the cemetery there, you know, I pass by Greenwood and Lyndhurst every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9071)|
| 2:31:19| where Tassel Pike is one of our most busiest roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| And so I'm looking at what this gentleman wants to have to be able to do his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9083)|
| 2:31:31| And, I mean, I'm for being able to allow this gentleman to be able to continue his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9091)|
| 2:31:39| And I haven't heard anything tonight that would lead me to think why I should vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9099)|
| 2:31:48| except that we make sure we get our sector plan and our rezoning and all that according to law and the rules together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9108)|
| 2:31:58| So that's, in terms of speed limit and how people, red lights and all, if we need a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9118)|
| 2:32:08| which I'm sure John Sevier has had many of them with the historic John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9128)|
| 2:32:13| we can't help what people do when they disobey the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| And so I guess that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| Next is Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| Commissioner Carringer, thank you for saying that we must obey the law and the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9147)|
| 2:32:33| Mr. Ballant got up, and I've met with Mr. Toole and Joanna, Ms. Toole, last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9153)|
| 2:32:39| They talked about this area and what this area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| They could go into why they want to come over to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| This is the South Sector, District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| Everything that they're talking about, the blasting and everything, is in District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| That's a totally different sector plan over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| Mr. Ballant says that nobody would want to buy this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9178)|
| 2:33:04| Well, I beg to differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| The 20 acres or the 19 acres right beside it is under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| and it will probably come up next month or the month of September for five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9190)|
| 2:33:15| And I'm pretty sure that there has been an offer for that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9195)|
| 2:33:21| except for the tools to sell or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| Mr. Ballant says that, you know, he talks about the Veterans Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| an obvious omission from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| Sector plan from 2012 is the same sector plan that was in 2007, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9212)|
| 2:33:39| It's LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| It's been LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| I believe it goes back to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| It will still come back as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| There's a lot of things wrong with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| The Knox Chapman down the street is a utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| Utilities can do whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| They don't need a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| They don't need to have approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| Right beside, in between Knox Chapman and the tools, is going to be a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9243)|
| 2:34:10| It's going to be probably five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| Right beside Knox Chapman is Serenity River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| If you all look, Serenity River is straight across from the blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| Serenity River is, I can't think, Dan Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| And it's being built out at probably 250 to $400,000 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9265)|
| 2:34:31| So, yes, there is a possibility that it can be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| What is the, I still not see, and we've got to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| This is a request to overturn planning commission that has gave us all the reasons why this should not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9280)|
| 2:34:50| They're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| Mr. Vallant has not told us one thing that will tell us that we can overturn a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9291)|
| 2:34:58| It's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9298)|
| 2:35:04| Let me think just a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| Lost my thought there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| Mr. Vallant says that, well, we'll bring up the veterans at the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9311)|
| 2:35:20| My discussions with the law director, the law director says that being state-owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9320)|
| 2:35:28| they don't have to follow the rules and regulations or the ordinance in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9328)|
| 2:35:33| because they're the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| So there's no admission from the sector plan from 2012 or 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9335)|
| 2:35:42| There's no admission anywhere that shows that sector plan that was approved by a commission is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9342)|
| 2:35:53| There's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9353)|
| 2:35:56| The tools have an opportunity to use their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| Maybe not as rural commercial because it is in a curve and if we could pull it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9360)|
| 2:36:06| if you'll pull it up on your web or on your laptop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| you'll see that there is a yard rail that extends all the way around that big curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9370)|
| 2:36:17| You have, I'm not sure, it's maybe not right, but there's 65 feet on one end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9377)|
| 2:36:24| and then you have a driveway where the church is on the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9384)|
| 2:36:32| This is a request to prove that MPC made the wrong decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9392)|
| 2:36:39| That's planning staff that came up with the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| and that is a 13-0 vote by MPC commissioners that says, yes, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9403)|
| 2:36:51| And at this point in time, and I love the tools and I want you to have somewhere, but it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9411)|
| 2:36:59| The sector plan don't cause for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| There's not been anything there to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| We've got to follow the ordinance as what the ordinance says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| and please show me somewhere where, and we've talked over the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9428)|
| 2:37:14| and I told you up front that there was no, there's nothing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9434)|
| 2:37:21| and I could read them to you, but I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| There's five reasons there to change a sector plan, and none of those has been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9443)|
| 2:37:29| So, at this, you know, I will make a motion before somebody jumps in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9449)|
| 2:37:37| I will make a motion that we deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| and follow the recommendation of planning staff that shows no sector plan irregularities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9460)|
| 2:37:51| and also the 13-0 vote by the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| Commissioner Daley has made a motion to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| and I think I heard, is there a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| So, we have a motion and a second on the floor, which we will now continue with discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9484)|
| 2:38:11| Next on the list is Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9491)|
| 2:38:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| Mr. Green, you said that there are other uses for this type of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9498)|
| 2:38:26| I know this is sector plan zoning, you know, it's a different discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| but you said the transition zoning had several uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| You started to kind of name what they were, but I didn't quite hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| The zoning they requested that would be consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9517)|
| 2:38:42| and allow the use includes retail sales from grocery stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| which likely would not occur there, but fueling stations, service stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| including convenience stores, a number of different types of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| and personal uses including equipment rental, service and repair farm equipment, restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9537)|
| 2:39:05| a number of professional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| So, there's a wide range of uses permitted in the zoning that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9547)|
| 2:39:13| that was requested as part of the sector plan zoning amendment request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| And how large is this area of land approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| We have started as a larger area, but the request now has been amended to four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| No, I know, but the entire piece of property is how big and how much is usable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9567)|
| 2:39:32| and how much are they requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9572)|
| 2:39:33| Those are, I guess, three different numbers that I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| The entire parcel is about ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| As far as what's usable, that I can't estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| Can you ballpark, is it half that's usable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| A bit over half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| Okay, so roughly six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| Six acres, about six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| And they're asking essentially for four to use of the ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9591)|
| 2:39:56| And so, the six is unusable because it's floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| It looks like less than six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| And there's a distinction between, within the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| there's a distinction between the floodway where no development can occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| and the flooding fringe or floodplain which can be developed if it's filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9610)|
| 2:40:15| or if the elevation of the first floor of the building is one foot above the flood elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9615)|
| 2:40:21| Okay, is it fair to say that roughly half of their piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| half of their property is going to be unusable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| Because a flood or a third is going to be unusable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| I'm trying to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| It looks like less than a third of it is unusable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| or limited in use because, again, some agricultural uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| depending on the extent of the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| But for residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9644)|
| 2:40:45| For residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| Okay, for typical residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| Can you also tell me when I imagine that the property adjacent to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9649)|
| 2:40:56| who is here in protest to this request tonight, the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9656)|
| 2:41:03| I'm assuming that piece of property was rural or agricultural beforehand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9663)|
| 2:41:09| And churches are permitted in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9671)|
| 2:41:12| When that was built, was there, I mean, I heard opposition related to dangerous curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9672)|
| 2:41:21| you know, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| Were traffic considerations brought up when that was developed that you're aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| There was before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| When was the church started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| We built the church about 13 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| If it was 13 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| Was that a concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| I mean, one of your objections was being on a curve with lots of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| but you built a church with lots of people on a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| I'm confused as to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| If it was a concern now, why wasn't it a concern then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| At that time, there was no Veterans Administration Cemetery built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| Same lady that owned that property owned our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9714)|
| 2:41:58| And so we didn't know what would go in that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| We were hoping, obviously, for a residential subdivision in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| Since I'm up here, I'd like to comment on the flood zone thing, the flood area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| because we abut the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| So there's no what's happening basically at his property should be happening at our property, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9732)|
| 2:42:19| So I think he's hit it on the nail that when you talk about less than a third of their property flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9739)|
| 2:42:25| we don't have any flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| So I don't know how that comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| There could be some flooding, I guess, if there's dips in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| But we have over 400 feet on the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| We have 1,200 feet on the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| But you've got to, can I say one other thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| You can't, and what you're doing here is determining what's going to happen if he puts his particular business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9767)|
| 2:42:56| But it opens the gate for all types of retail, all types of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| He may sell it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| There's nothing that obligates him once he gets the zoning to go with his building or whatever he hopes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9783)|
| 2:43:11| But what's going to happen 10 years from now, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| Our church is a growing, small church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| We have a brand-new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| We've had plans to develop the 13 acres for recreation, a soccer field or a football field, that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9799)|
| 2:43:30| We'd like to even develop our water frontage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| But his type of business, I don't think I want to say anything about his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9813)|
| 2:43:38| But the issue is that business can change and probably will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| But with all due respect, your church could move to a different location, and that building could change too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| If somebody wanted to apply for a rezoning, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| No, I'm saying that we're, I guess I'm making the point that buildings change all the time across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9833)|
| 2:44:00| And so, yes, zoning is one thing, but use of that building is a completely different one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| I don't want to get too far off the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| I mostly was asking about traffic, and your original concern was about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9847)|
| 2:44:14| But you didn't have concern about traffic with your church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| You have concern about traffic with the next person's property, and I'm confused about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| Actually, traffic in itself is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| If we had a red light out front, like the rest of the zoning is, is you go toward Asheville Highway or Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9865)|
| 2:44:33| When you have a red light at that intersection, in fact, that's part of the Planning Commission's reasoning for denying this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9873)|
| 2:44:42| There's no intersection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| There needs to be an intersection to justify that from our particular highway, that particular zoning, it doesn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9884)|
| 2:44:53| In other words, if you go back, you'll recognize these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| You go back toward Asheville Highway, you've got a Shell service station on one corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9896)|
| 2:45:01| You go across the street, you've got a taco food place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| You go up to the next red light, there's the pilot station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| Across from it is the same markets and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| Now, that's what you're going to allow if you allow this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| It's up to you all, but the Planning Commission was pretty straightforward, I thought, with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9916)|
| 2:45:21| That's one reason we didn't say too much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| I have a question for Mr. Toole. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| Mr. Toole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9927)|
| 2:45:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| I believe you and your wife are partners in this business, and you're both involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| Could you just tell us a little bit about your business and what you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| Mr. Toole, if you could state your name and address for the record, will you speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| I'd just like to know a little bit more about the agricultural nature of your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| Robbie Toole, 2360 Hauser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9947)|
| 2:45:52| We started an erosion sediment control business back in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9952)|
| 2:45:58| It's run under the name Volunteer Erosion Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| We also have a company called Erosion Supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| So our supply company sells erosion sediment control products from straw matting, seed, straw, silt fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9965)|
| 2:46:19| We sell a lot of trees, plants, livestakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9979)|
| 2:46:24| We do a lot of stream restoration, shoreline stabilization, and those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9984)|
| 2:46:33| We've been operating here in the area for several years at our location on Asbury, just really close proximity to this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=9993)|
| 2:46:48| Can you tell us a little bit about the flow of your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| Is it during the day, during the week, weekends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| How many people, employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| I mean, can you give us a sense of how your business operates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10017)|
| 2:47:01| So Monday through Friday, we have anywhere from 15 to 20 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10021)|
| 2:47:09| They work 7 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10029)|
| 2:47:13| In real busy times, we'll work Saturdays as well, usually just a skeleton crew of about three individuals, three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10033)|
| 2:47:23| We don't work any Sundays at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10043)|
| 2:47:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| Let's say one more thing, and then I'll give up the mic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10052)|
| 2:47:37| This body consistently applauds agricultural development and talks about our farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10057)|
| 2:47:45| and talks about our rural businesses and talks about the people that help support our agricultural business and industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10065)|
| 2:47:53| And I feel like this is a business that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| This is somebody who owns a piece of property that's not asking for a really, really over-the-top egregious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10078)|
| 2:48:04| I have a hard time for us as a body making decisions based on what might happen down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10084)|
| 2:48:10| what might happen if somebody were to buy the piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| what might happen if something happens down the road versus what is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| We have small business owners that are trying to build their business, and we make exceptions all the time for really big businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10096)|
| 2:48:23| And I think Commissioner Anders talked about a lot of the exceptions we made just up the road on the same stretch of highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10103)|
| 2:48:31| for a much larger company to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| And I think that we ought to really think twice about how we help support some of our smaller agricultural businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10115)|
| 2:48:41| If it doesn't fit exactly perfect and it wasn't a vision 20, 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10121)|
| 2:48:45| I'm not sure it shouldn't be part of a conversation now just because it hasn't always been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| So I think we should think hard about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| I know there's a lot of different parts and pieces that have to go one before the other before the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| but this seems to me exactly the type of business that we ought to be trying to figure out how to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| and find a way to help one of our landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| So I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10144)|
| 2:49:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10145)|
| 2:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10146)|
| 2:49:07| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10147)|
| 2:49:08| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10148)|
| 2:49:09| Commissioner Smith, your light is no longer on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| I think Skinmaker was before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10152)|
| 2:49:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10156)|
| 2:49:17| Then Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| Well, first, Mr. Sliman, is there other members in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10160)|
| 2:49:25| I see people in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10165)|
| 2:49:26| Are they here supporting the denial or are they here supporting the Toole family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10166)|
| 2:49:33| Do you know or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| I know we've got a boy scout in the back who's earning a citizenship and a community merit badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10175)|
| 2:49:39| so raise your hand and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10182)|
| 2:49:47| So it's just two here in opposition then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| John, our church operates as a session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| We have elders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10194)|
| 2:49:55| They selected me since I have experience in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10199)|
| 2:50:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10200)|
| 2:50:01| And then I have some more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| Mr. Green, on the rezoning, the intent was to rezone the whole nine to ten acres for rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10204)|
| 2:50:13| which the MPC denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10213)|
| 2:50:16| But in other words, if that had gone forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10216)|
| 2:50:22| the gentleman could have put his building, say, in the center of the ten acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10222)|
| 2:50:29| and then because it would be zoned rural commercial on the road frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10229)|
| 2:50:35| there could be, say, a dollar general put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| Would that be a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10239)|
| 2:50:42| This would be permitted in the rural commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10242)|
| 2:50:46| Because we have no guarantee at this point what he's actually going to do on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10246)|
| 2:50:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10251)|
| 2:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| As I stated, that's one of the challenges that planning staff and the planning commission faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10253)|
| 2:50:58| We have to consider all the uses permitted in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10258)|
| 2:51:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10262)|
| 2:51:03| And then the other question I have is, had this been designated as an agricultural business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10263)|
| 2:51:09| we wouldn't be sitting here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| But this business is not an agricultural business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10274)|
| 2:51:15| I'm going to defer to those who know the law better than I, so I'm looking over our ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10275)|
| 2:51:21| I'll start with Mr. Sanders since he's on the hot seat up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| So we've dealt with the definition of agriculture before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| I can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10291)|
| 2:51:38| Under the Tennessee Code, wherever the term agriculture appears in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10298)|
| 2:51:44| it means the land, buildings, and machinery used in the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10304)|
| 2:51:50| activity carried on in connection with the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10310)|
| 2:51:55| And then it goes on to list also recreational and entertainment activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10315)|
| 2:51:59| that are secondary to the commercial production of farm products and nursery stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10319)|
| 2:52:06| So, you know, you can read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| We can discuss and parse out what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10330)|
| 2:52:13| There are several Attorney General's opinions that have been written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| and court cases that have been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10336)|
| 2:52:21| Now, if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| So in your opinion, I was going to say just in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10345)|
| 2:52:29| then this is not an agricultural business based on the testimony that's been presented today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10349)|
| 2:52:35| Well, you really have to get down into the weeds, and it's a case-by-case determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10355)|
| 2:52:43| I think the key for making that determination is whether there is a commercial production of farm products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10363)|
| 2:52:53| For instance, the Supreme Court has said in a case when the Assembly adopted this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10373)|
| 2:53:01| it was focused on the activities related to the production of farm products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10381)|
| 2:53:06| That is to say the growing or raising of these products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10386)|
| 2:53:10| Well, I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| I can't see the leap between erosion control business and agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10392)|
| 2:53:18| So that, well, anyways, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| That's all farming is is erosion control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| We're growing our own hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| We're growing some of the products we're using in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| On that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10414)|
| 2:53:43| Well, there's got to be some overwhelming reason why the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10423)|
| 2:53:48| and the MPC commissioners voted unanimously to deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10428)|
| 2:53:52| because they always seem to want to, you know, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10432)|
| 2:54:07| Commissioner Skinmaker, you still have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10449)|
| 2:54:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10450)|
| 2:54:13| Commissioner Skinmaker, are you wrapped up on that particular question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10453)|
| 2:54:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| All right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10457)|
| 2:54:18| Next we've got Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| I think Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| Or is it Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| I'm trying to get to all the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| I know we flipped that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| All right, go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10467)|
| 2:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10468)|
| 2:54:29| First of all, we're beating a dead horse we can't do nothing with tonight because it's zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10469)|
| 2:54:35| and it has to have a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| So let's take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| Now let's take ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| This is done as ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| If he wants to build a big barn on his property, he can build a big barn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10484)|
| 2:54:49| and he can store machinery and anything like that that has to do with farming or any ag business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10489)|
| 2:54:56| If he grows hay and he stacks hay in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| then he's got product that he will sell from that farmland out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10498)|
| 2:55:02| So it could be an ag business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10502)|
| 2:55:06| The thing that bothers me about this place is the proximity to the road and the turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10506)|
| 2:55:12| If he's got ten acres, is there another location that he could come out more safely on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| That's the other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| Is there another place that could be safer to exit that business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10523)|
| 2:55:29| Because if he's growing and he's getting farm products that he's distributing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10529)|
| 2:55:35| if you try to do erosion control, that's a big part of farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| That's what you're doing there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| So in this use of this land, if he builds a big barn, he stores his machinery inside of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10541)|
| 2:55:51| and it has to do with erosion control and farming equipment, could he not do it on the current zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10551)|
| 2:55:58| He just has to prove that that's what he's doing with the machinery there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10558)|
| 2:56:03| He doesn't have to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| He can use that property as it sits if it is ag business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10565)|
| 2:56:10| But he has to prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| The problem I have when you do a business there, what's the safest access to the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10572)|
| 2:56:17| Can he access it someplace else would be another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10577)|
| 2:56:21| But as of right now, we're talking about something we can't do anything about because it's about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| and you have to have a sector plan in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| So we can talk about that all night long, but we've got to do something to where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10591)|
| 2:56:38| We're in a situation that if we deny this, does that tie up the land for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10598)|
| 2:56:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| Does it tie up the land for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10608)|
| 2:56:49| If it does, can he go back and use it as an ag business since it's already done as agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10609)|
| 2:56:59| Now, that's a decision that goes through the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10619)|
| 2:57:07| So right now, we're beating the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| We don't need to beat anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| And I don't want to tie his land up for a year either, so I'm not sure how we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10635)|
| 2:57:21| Mr. Law Director, let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10641)|
| 2:57:22| Daniel, that's a question to address to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10642)|
| 2:57:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| I don't want to tie this man's land up for a year with us discussing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| but if we deny this coming back here, can he use it as an agricultural business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10649)|
| 2:57:34| If it can be used as an agricultural business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10654)|
| 2:57:37| He doesn't have to have any rezoning or any approvals to engage in any agricultural activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10657)|
| 2:57:43| So he just has to decide what he's doing is agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10663)|
| 2:57:47| and then they have to decide that it is agricultural business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10670)|
| 2:57:52| If we're speaking in categorical terms, if he wants to engage in agriculture on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| he can do that right now without any approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| So we can't do the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| We don't want to tie his land up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10686)|
| 2:58:07| So where are we at from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10687)|
| 2:58:08| What can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10688)|
| 2:58:09| Nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| The commission has two options right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| Either you could deny the rezoning or you could initiate a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10695)|
| 2:58:22| If you initiate a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| then the sector plan is going to come back here to be considered together with the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10704)|
| 2:58:29| probably two months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10709)|
| 2:58:35| I'd rather for him to find out if he can use it for agricultural business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| build a big barn and put his stuff in there and go from there if he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10718)|
| 2:58:42| So I'm not going to make a motion either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| I just thought I'd throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10726)|
| 2:58:47| We do a lot of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10727)|
| 2:58:48| Ma'am, I'll be with you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| You've actually already spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| and there's a few commissioners that haven't had a chance to sway in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| We usually try to give everybody one chance before we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| If you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| I just want to make sure I'm in fairness to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| Next, I want to call on Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10739)|
| 2:59:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| And I could have heard what the opposition said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| The property has not met the sector plan change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10747)|
| 2:59:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10753)|
| 2:59:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| Then you know the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| That's all I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| And Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| This is the second rural commercial zoning we've had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| It's our sector plan change for commercial zoning, rural commercial zoning tonight, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10768)|
| 2:59:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10772)|
| 2:59:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10773)|
| 2:59:34| And the first one, Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| it didn't appear that that piece of property was at the intersection of the two required roads either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10776)|
| 2:59:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| And there was no mention of staff worry about what would happen if that business failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10783)|
| 2:59:48| Was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| That location seemed appropriate for the uses permitted in the rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10790)|
| 2:59:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10797)|
| 2:59:58| So why do we look at if one business fails and the other one fails and judge them differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10798)|
| 3:00:04| And we look at properties on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10804)|
| 3:00:07| Every property is unique, has unique characteristics, and based on those characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10807)|
| 3:00:12| staff makes a recommendation and presents it to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| and then the planning commission makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10818)|
| 3:00:19| And we did not consider any use, any particular use on the preceding one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| We looked at all the uses that might be permitted under the rural commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10825)|
| 3:00:29| and felt it would be appropriate on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10831)|
| 3:00:32| And we have made a change to some of our add uses in rural areas, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10832)|
| 3:00:40| The event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10840)|
| 3:00:42| The event center, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| And we've been looking for ways to use our agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| in more productive ways in Knox County, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10847)|
| 3:00:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10851)|
| 3:00:52| Is that in some sense something that has happened since the last sector plan was initiated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10852)|
| 3:00:59| Yes, it's happened in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10859)|
| 3:01:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10862)|
| 3:01:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10865)|
| 3:01:06| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10866)|
| 3:01:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10867)|
| 3:01:08| Now we're back to Commissioner Daley and Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| Anders came in, but also I haven't had a chance to weigh in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| and I think Commissioner Schoonmaker had a question earlier I just wanted to weigh in on a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10873)|
| 3:01:17| was, you know, when I looked at this, I guess the first reason that I came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10877)|
| 3:01:22| walked away from why the denial in was the location was not at the intersection of two thoroughfares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10882)|
| 3:01:29| either arterial or collector streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| That struck me as one of the most important things that the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| was probably looking for in this particular zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10895)|
| 3:01:40| and this is nowhere near kind of those collector streets as meets the definition of rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10900)|
| 3:01:48| which I suspect that may have been one of the reasons why they denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10908)|
| 3:01:51| I know that's in conflict with the other one that we had, but is that your take on this, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10911)|
| 3:01:56| I mean, is that one of the reasons why the planning commission may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| and I know you weren't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| but was that a legitimate reason why they possibly denied this with emphasis on a 12-vote vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10921)|
| 3:02:10| I was not at the meeting, and what I surmised from the meeting is just contained in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10930)|
| 3:02:17| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| I mentioned to you, so go ahead if you're responding to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| Yeah, and I wanted to bring up another point, again, because I'm a little confused about this agricultural deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10945)|
| 3:02:31| When you say erosion control, and I'll ask commissioners if they want to go to Volunteer Erosion Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10951)|
| 3:02:39| the company that he does, and look at their website and tell me how that's an agricultural business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10959)|
| 3:02:45| because it's silt fencing, grading, erosion matting, laying gravel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10965)|
| 3:02:52| and so this is not an agricultural business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10972)|
| 3:02:55| This is a commercial operation that wants to go into a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10975)|
| 3:02:59| So the website is VECTN.com if you want to see what they want to do at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10979)|
| 3:03:07| Plain and simple. It's right there for everybody to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| So that's what I was thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| Erosion control is the silt fencing and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10993)|
| 3:03:16| That's not agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| And, you know, I have a lot of confidence in Commissioner Daley that he does his due diligence for the matters that affect his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=10999)|
| 3:03:28| And when he's gone out and met with all the parties and he says this is not right for that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11008)|
| 3:03:37| that's the way I go because I trust his judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11017)|
| 3:03:42| There is nothing that we've heard tonight that says we should overturn what the MPC said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11022)|
| 3:03:48| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| I was going to give Ms. Pritchett, before I speak, I was going to give Ms. Pritchett an opportunity because I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11030)|
| 3:03:55| All right. Okay. Go ahead, Ms. Pritchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11038)|
| 3:03:59| I just wanted to comment in terms of the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| I have no expertise in that, but there's at least five houses adjacent to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11043)|
| 3:04:10| I mean, in line with this property at the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| I mean, at the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| In Serenity River development, there's at least, I'm going to say, eight large homes right at the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11057)|
| 3:04:28| KEB's property goes right down a lot of their facility to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11068)|
| 3:04:39| In terms of whether this is business or agriculture, I mean, clearly, it was presented as a business, a commercial business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11079)|
| 3:04:51| where there will be contracts, as they indicated with the Defense Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11091)|
| 3:04:57| where there will be people coming in to purchase and contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11097)|
| 3:05:03| It's not just a matter of raising hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| So, I think there needs to be caution in terms of trying to redefine this as agriculture when the intent is business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11108)|
| 3:05:19| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11120)|
| 3:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11121)|
| 3:05:22| All right. Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11122)|
| 3:05:23| Yeah. Mr. Baggett, during the NPC meeting, what were the arguments made on behalf of that applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11123)|
| 3:05:30| Or was there a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| Pretty much the same that we made here, only we were very abbreviated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11133)|
| 3:05:40| I don't think the whole meeting lasted but just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11140)|
| 3:05:48| So it was more or less, I mean, I basically have what my arguments were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11148)|
| 3:05:53| It was just talking about what the business did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11156)|
| 3:05:57| We did not get in to the reasons for the change in the sector plan or the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11157)|
| 3:06:06| We did talk about the query and the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11166)|
| 3:06:12| We didn't talk much about the traffic generated by the cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11172)|
| 3:06:17| which was one of the changes in conditions along the highway, which we would be relying on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11177)|
| 3:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| You know, I don't know how I'll end up at the end of this discussion because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11187)|
| 3:06:33| I think there's clearly valid arguments on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| But I think throwing caution to the wind and erring on the side of caution, I'd like to make a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11196)|
| 3:06:42| And because Commissioner Bussler said, I don't want to tie this guy's land up for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11202)|
| 3:06:47| and him not have an answer for his business when there may be an opportunity for this to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11207)|
| 3:06:54| in a more restrictive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| And so I'm going to make a substitute motion that we send back with a sector plan amendment request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11215)|
| 3:07:03| And I guess, for a lack of better terms, Gerald, on what kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11223)|
| 3:07:08| is this considered an agricultural business by the Attorney General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11228)|
| 3:07:12| And to give all those questions time to get vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| but send an amendment back to see if this can be used for this applicant's purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11234)|
| 3:07:21| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11241)|
| 3:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11242)|
| 3:07:23| Seconded by, was that Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11245)|
| 3:07:26| So, Commissioner Anders, I'm going to ask you to restate that motion before we have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11246)|
| 3:07:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11254)|
| 3:07:35| I do want to tell the people in the audience, though, this is not, if this is granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11255)|
| 3:07:39| this is not giving this gentleman the opportunity to build this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11259)|
| 3:07:42| I think it's just exercising due caution on property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11262)|
| 3:07:46| And I think that's essentially where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| I may fall completely on the other side a few months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11268)|
| 3:07:53| But I think that the motion would be to send back a sector plan amendment request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11273)|
| 3:07:58| as per the applicant's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| so we can make sure that we have all of our questions answered before we tie this land up for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11280)|
| 3:08:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11285)|
| 3:08:06| That's the motion and the second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11286)|
| 3:08:08| I also want to make just a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11288)|
| 3:08:11| So, as part of that sector plan revision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| that question ultimately that we have discussed is whether this is an ag business or not an ag business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11293)|
| 3:08:18| How will that be defined within that sector plan request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11298)|
| 3:08:22| Is that something that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11302)|
| 3:08:23| Well, it's not in the sector plan request, but it gives the opportunity for the questions to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| So, what that, effectively, what you're doing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| That's up to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11308)|
| 3:08:29| That's up to the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| I'm just talking about the sector plan amendment request as per the applicant request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| So, we can, and if the MPC or if the Planning Commission turns it down again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| then we're back to square one on denial or not denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| I think out of exercise and due caution for somebody's land rights, I think that's the wise thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11321)|
| 3:08:48| Because what has come to us is a zoning request, and you're actually asking to send back a sector plan request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11328)|
| 3:08:54| which would have to have been done anyhow before a zoning request could have gotten here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| So, I'm just kind of restating for everybody on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11339)|
| 3:09:02| The cart, to a certain extent, was in front of the horse when it came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11342)|
| 3:09:07| And then, and during that time period, there will be implemented by the Planning Commission or the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11347)|
| 3:09:14| Who's going to lead the question around the ag question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| That's up to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11358)|
| 3:09:19| I mean, he's got to prove his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11359)|
| 3:09:20| I mean, I'm just allowing, because there's a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| There's more questions than answers tonight, and I think this is a fair thing to do to exercise caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11362)|
| 3:09:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| So, we have a substitute motion, as restated twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11368)|
| 3:09:31| The second has been made by Commissioner Jay on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| Commissioner Busler, before we vote on that substitute motion, I wanted to give you a chance to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| Now, give me a little clarity on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11378)|
| 3:09:40| I was just asking, okay, it's already designated as agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11380)|
| 3:09:45| Could he use his business in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| If it comes back and they say we deny it because it's not, we're not going to do the commercial out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11387)|
| 3:09:54| but he could use it to do X, Y, and Z on that that has to do with agricultural business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11394)|
| 3:10:01| Is that what you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11401)|
| 3:10:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11402)|
| 3:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| Yes, Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| Simple thing to do is go out to Asbury Road and look and see if it's agricultural or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11411)|
| 3:10:16| You'll get your answer real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| Tonight's discussion was not whether it's agricultural or be zone agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11419)|
| 3:10:24| The discussion and the vote should have been on did KK Planners and Commission get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11424)|
| 3:10:33| That's the only thing it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| It's not all this other stuff around it that everybody wants to put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11435)|
| 3:10:40| It's the denial, approved or disapproved because of their planning staff recommendation and a 13-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11440)|
| 3:10:50| That's all it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11450)|
| 3:10:52| Now, if it goes back to a sector plan review and it comes back as the same thing, we have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11452)|
| 3:11:01| And I honestly believe that it will come back as the same thing, that the sector plan says LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11461)|
| 3:11:07| the property next to it is LDR, the property across the street is LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11467)|
| 3:11:11| There's no commercial around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| So I just wanted to make clear that this was about a decision, not what the use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11473)|
| 3:11:21| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11483)|
| 3:11:24| Commissioner Jay, or I thought I saw your light on for a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11484)|
| 3:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11487)|
| 3:11:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| We have a motion that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11489)|
| 3:11:31| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11491)|
| 3:11:32| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11492)|

| 3:11:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11496)|
| 3:11:38| Director Green, on the map that I'm looking at, and this is the map that was part of the package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11498)|
| 3:11:46| on the church's property there's a CI on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| What does that stand for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11509)|
| 3:11:50| That's institutional allowance, things such as churches and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11510)|
| 3:11:55| And that was amendment, that was a change in the most recent sector plan to recognize the location of the church there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11515)|
| 3:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11523)|
| 3:12:04| And that was an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11524)|
| 3:12:06| Didn't we just recently change that one to allow these institutional zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11526)|
| 3:12:11| No, that's an old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11531)|
| 3:12:14| That's old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11534)|
| 3:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11535)|
| 3:12:16| So is it zoned agricultural or CI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11536)|
| 3:12:18| Zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11538)|
| 3:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11539)|

| 3:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11543)|
| 3:12:24| I think we're ready to vote on this so that the motion specifically is to send back for the sector plan revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11544)|
| 3:12:30| as previously stated twice by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11550)|
| 3:12:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11554)|

| 3:12:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, because this is a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| Since Carson's motion was on the floor that we didn't vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11561)|
| 3:12:46| so we got a substitute motion by Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| So we're voting on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11571)|
| 3:12:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11572)|
| 3:12:53| And Commissioner Daley, we had not actually voted on his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| It was on the floor where we had discussion and then he made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11580)|
| 3:13:01| So the item we are voting on is the substitute motion, which was discussed and clarified twice by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11581)|
| 3:13:07| So all in favor of the substitute motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11587)|

| 3:15:20| go to the website and find it more directly using the logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11720)|
| 3:15:23| So it's not color-coded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11723)|
| 3:15:24| It has the case number on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| And on that property, when I drove by it this weekend, it has a huge A for appeal on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11727)|
| 3:15:32| So I just wanted to make sure everyone needs to know that now the colors are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11732)|
| 3:15:38| It's all the same sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| So it's not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| They have A for appeal, R for rezoning, S for subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11742)|
| 3:15:45| But it's colors are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| Colors are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190722?start=11747)|
