| 1:45:26| And it begins at 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| So it will be a direct conflict for some of us that are very involved in that organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| and maybe a conflict for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| So I would just ask our chairman to think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| if there's a possibility of starting at 4.30, going 4.30 to 6.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| or something like that, because I know none of us want to walk out in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| when we're all engaged to finding good solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| We'll leave that and we'll work with you guys on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| We're very flexible about what we can do with our structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| We want to meet your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| You know, I really had my light on a while ago, and I turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| And I think what Tony said is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| and I would really ask the chairs to set some real strict guidelines on how we're going to handle the public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| I mean, we've all been there when, and I think that Mike really tried to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| but it still got out of hand at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| And, you know, I think we need to let the public forum part stay short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| and not let it get into an argument between someone at the stand and one of the people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| where things start going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| We really need to have some strict rules that are enforced, you know, on the public forum part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| We can absolutely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Become nonproductive very quickly if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| Two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| We want to protect you guys in this process, because this is a sensitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| And when we're working on some of this, some of your emotions may be a little raw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| and I don't want somebody to take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| And second is we want to make sure that we end in a positive note as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| And it doesn't do us any good to settle into some kind of raucous to and fro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| You know, the other thing, because some of our public forums seem to go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| I mean, I don't know what the number is, but sometimes we've had 10 or 15 people got up and said the same thing again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| And we might limit it if we're talking about one thing and say three people are going to speak or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| if it's on one particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Because some of this can go on if we get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| You know, 20 people for five minutes is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| And what you understand, this is part of the reason you guys bring me in, is I can help do that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6444)|
| 1:47:31| And if they're not happy with that, they can be not happy with me instead of not happy with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| And that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| We look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| I hope you found this to be a good beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| I am convinced that this body will come up with a fantastic document that's going to be a model for here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| and maybe statewide nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| And I'm looking forward to further work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| Thank you very much, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| And we'll move right into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| And our first speaker is Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| Mr. McAdams, if you would give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| And you have three minutes to speak and up to three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6484)|
| 1:48:11| It's 647.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| My name is Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| I'm here tonight on behalf of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| We appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight and to participate in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| We hope we can participate even more going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| And I'd like to express to you our concerns about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| I agree with a lot of what's been said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| The Chamber agrees with a lot of what's been said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| We are in favor of responsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| We are in favor of appropriate control of runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| We are in favor of tightening the codes and regulations to ensure the development is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| We are in favor of ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| We are in favor of protection of scenic areas in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| But we also want to be sure that it's done in a way that the people understand what the rules are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| what the laws are, so they can comply with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| We're in favor of making it as definite as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| And we'd like to work with you to improve the laws, tighten the laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| and make development understandable by everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| What we don't want to see is adoption of vague documents, of pushing things into planned zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6564)|
| 1:49:35| of doing things in a way that no one can look at the law and be sure what he or she can do with their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| Our concern about the process that you've described tonight is we think you're starting at the wrong place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| and we think that what was described as the goal is ending at the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| What you asked for was a study and recommendations on how to achieve conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| and how to do appropriate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| We're 100 percent in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| What you got was an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| And that is a legally binding document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| When it becomes operative, it becomes the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| You have to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Therefore, it's binding on the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| We think it's the wrong starting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| We would urge you to take a step back and say, what should we be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| Should we be looking at a general plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| Should we be looking at amending the minimum subdivision regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| Should we be looking at amending the grading ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| Should we be looking at either tightening the city tree ordinance or adopting a county tree ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| Should we be looking at enforcement issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| Is it that there's a problem with the code, or is it a lack of enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| There are not the city is not awash in development problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| There are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| Many of them are government projects that you see on the fronts of the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| And it's not like the development community is run amuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| You have responsible development going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| We think you do need to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| But we would urge you not to work toward what general plan amendment can we adopt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| but to step back and say, how should we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| The chamber has been working on and has hired engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| and is prepared to work with you on specific recommendations on specific ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| We are in favor, for example, of adoption of a ridgetop overlay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| Identify areas that are truly ridgetops, that are truly of scenic interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6694)|
| 1:51:40| that are visible from other areas, and let's protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| We don't think this general plan does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| We think it is the wrong place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| It's too long, too vague, too general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| And we would urge you to back up from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| and let's go through this process with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Next speaker is Barbara Nicodemus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| It is 6.51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| I'm Barbara Nicodemus with the League of Women Voters, 4016 Sam Cooper Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| I'm just going to take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| I have a question and a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| How will the public get the factual information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| that will be disseminated to this joint committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6738)|
| 1:52:25| I was thinking about that very thing as he was talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| I know that we can put a lot of this on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| and it might be that we can develop just a page or something on the county website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6750)|
| 1:52:37| where we would have these documents talk about the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| and any information that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| Because one of the things pointed out is that there's been a lot of misinformation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| and if you all are getting the facts, I think it needs to be available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| I'll be talking to our IT people in the morning about this very thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| on how we can do it, and we will have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| We'll talk about it again on Monday during our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| And then I have a request that you post your agenda online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| so that the public can download it before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| Newly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| Our next speaker is Rachel Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| It's 6.52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| If you could give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| You have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Rachel Craig, 2222 Allen Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| I won't use my three minutes either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| First, I just want to take the time to say thank you for what you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| I think it's terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| I think it's the only way that we're ever going to get to an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| in this community on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| And I am so grateful to see you doing it, and I want to support you any way I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| I just want to make a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| And one of them, and I think everybody knows this, but it's worth repeating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| is that I have not heard a single individual in this community say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6838)|
| 1:54:04| they are against hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| It's not a question of you're against it or you're for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| It's a question of how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| So just in case anybody's got this impression out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| that there are people who think we shouldn't do this at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| maybe there are, but I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| I also wanted to mention this thing about the general plan that I keep hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| My understanding is that council and commission asked the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| to make recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| and the recommendation that they came up with was to amend the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| So I don't see that the task force didn't follow your direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| and what they were instructed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| Their recommendation is just the way to handle this is to pass a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| that will be part of the general plan like all of our plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| Then I, too, have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| One, and I came in a couple minutes late and I may have missed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| is there a date set for the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| Two weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| August the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| Five o'clock so far, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| Unless you change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| Secondly, I think I understood in the last meeting that you all had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| and also in this meeting that the way this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| the general way in which you're going to proceed is that you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| identify the sticking points and then try to take each one and discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| and see if you can find a resolution to that sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| Am I correct in that assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| One of the things we talked about at our next meeting was to identify those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| areas that we feel need to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| and I think we've agreed that rather than doing subcommittees together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| that information is going to be during our regular meeting that we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| So as far as the meeting times, it's going to be every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| But one of the things Mr. Joyner is going to do is utilize his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| and correct me if I'm wrong, on these issues that we bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| he's going to be utilizing his staff to gather the information to get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| And these sticking points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| the starting place for identifying sticking points will be looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| plan as it has been passed by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| That's what you're going to be looking at as your basis for there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| sticking point here, here, here, and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| That's what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| I would say that we've got to start somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| and that's a logical place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| And then I have one question for Mr. Joyner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| Rachel, before you leave, we heard a speaker before you say that perhaps we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| starting in the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| So there's that question that may come up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| Well, yeah, I heard the speaker before me say basically we should start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| If you could wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| And that's a really important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| There's a big difference between starting over and taking what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| and looking at it in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| and trying to see if we can resolve our differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| So, I mean, that's a gigantic difference in the approach y'all take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| So I want to be clear on what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| And I have one quick question for Mr. Joyner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| You said you were going to be talking to other stakeholders privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7054)|
| 1:57:41| and I heard you mention the chamber and developers, which, of course, is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| But I'm wondering how you plan to identify and contact other stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| That will be through my conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| In case you didn't hear him, he said that will – those things will come from y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| So that's a pretty big responsibility you have to identify stakeholders on both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Next speaker is Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| If you could come to the microphone, give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| It's 657.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| You have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazeville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| I've spoken to many of you, at least these two bodies, about stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| and I don't consider myself to be an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| but I have taken the two courses that TDEC offers on erosion prevention and sediment control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| I just took some notes as you all were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| Keep in mind that all zoning limits development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| so people can't do just anything they want to with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| Most streams in Knox County that are on the list of impaired streams are impaired for the reason of siltation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7128)|
| 1:59:00| Houses also that were built years ago, due to upstream development partly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7140)|
| 1:59:07| these older homes are now in what is the floodplain because the floodplain has enlarged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| So you need to keep that in mind, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| It's not necessarily that these homes were built in the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| It's that the floodplain has expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| and now more people have to have or should have flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| Also, to take the trees out of the creeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| I wasn't sure, and I wish Mr. Smith had not left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| but if these are trees that are growing there, that's a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| because it slows the water down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| or you're going to flood somebody and knock their house completely off its foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| But if it's just a matter of cleaning out the streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| I think the city does a good job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| Also, the city's permit from the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7195)|
| 2:00:02| is affected by what happens in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| because the county streams are part of the cities, and they flow into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7205)|
| 2:00:10| So please keep that in mind as you're deciding these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| because the city and county where I would like for them to be lockstep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| they may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| And I pray that the city will take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| because you're going to be fined for the things that happen outside of your realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| and I just feel like you need to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| I just have a couple more points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| This plan, as I read it, will not drastically affect what is going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| And as they said, a lot of information has been disseminated that hasn't been accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| And I would just like to give one example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| and I don't think this is out of reason to say this because it was said at a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| but a lot of things have been said to promote hysteria, especially among property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7259)|
| 2:01:08| A gentleman got up and said that a family had owned their land for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| and now they were going to build their dream home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| and they were not going to be able to because of this plan if it was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| And there were gasps in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| And people talked to him afterwards, and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| you don't really believe that, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| And he admitted, no, I know that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| But to get up here and say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| I think you're going to have to have some way to say that's not a true thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| or you're going to have to have some kind of rebuttal or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| because that was said in one of the public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| and it was really terrible that people left here thinking that they would not be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7307)|
| 2:01:55| And the last thing that I have to say is regarding what Rachel Craig said about the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7315)|
| 2:02:03| I hope that neighborhoods, prominent neighborhoods within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| and county will be included in discussions or ask about those measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Mr. Chairman, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110721hillsideprotection?start=7342)|
