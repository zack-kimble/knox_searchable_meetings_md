| 0:00:29| Welcome to the Board of Education's August 5th, 2024 work session. Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=29)|
| 0:00:39| And if you will now, I thought you'd read the recluse starting to speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=45)|
| 0:00:52| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=52)|
| 0:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=69)|
| 0:01:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Miss Horn will not be in attendance tonight due to out of town travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| She will be here Thursday and we will be recognizing our outgoing members Thursday evening for their service to Knox County School and to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| And I want to thank Dr. Butler for alerting us last month that the dates for our November meeting conflicts with the TSBA conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=89)|
| 0:01:38| So Miss Coatney spoke with each of you at some point about your preference on rescheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| So thank you for sharing your calendars with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| It appears that Monday evening works best with everyone's calendar that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| And so without objection, Superintendent Reiswick and I did discuss changing both meetings with the work session and the regular session meeting to that Monday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=110)|
| 0:02:02| So we will have a 30 minute recess in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| So I hope that works, seemed to work with the majority of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| But I promise Reverend Butler that will be the only time that we do one meeting in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| And thank you to everyone in attendance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| Are there any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| Yes, Miss Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| I'd like to request adding a libraries update from one of our staff members just wherever you would feel appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=142)|
| 0:02:30| Just with all of those changes that have happened in starting school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| Do we have somebody here that can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Do we want to add that to the work session one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Are you talking about Thursday night or this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Oh, this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Just a small update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Are there any other changes or objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| Yeah, right before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Yeah, so item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| We'll add item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| We'll add that right after the strategic plan committee update before discussion of the regular session if that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Do we have a motion then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Motion by Miss Christie, second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Superintendent Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Thank you for the opportunity to provide some updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| As you know, this is a big week for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| At Principals Institute a couple weeks ago, I told leaders that the days leading up to the new school year always feels like Friday night football to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| And I went on to tell them as we move into year three of us doing these things that I kind of feel like what a national championship coach feels like before the season starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=213)|
| 0:03:43| I really think we're going to do some great things this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| And you could sense that in the room from the principals, just their clarity of mission and what they've done for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| So it's easy to get excited coming back to school when you have that feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| So feel great about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Our teachers and our school staff have been working hard to prepare for students who return on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| And I know that this year is going to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Over the last two years, you know that we've been intentional about not just working hard but doing the right work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| keeping students at the center of every decision and remaining focused on our four priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| And because of that, across the district, more than 50 percent of fourth graders scored proficient in ELA this year, well ahead of the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| Third grade ELA proficiency rose to 43.5 percent, an increase of more than five percentage points over the last two years, the highest on record for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=264)|
| 0:04:34| Grades three through eight math have risen by 6.1 percent over the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| So all of those are about our teachers and our principals being intentional every day in the little decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| We talk about that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Just make the little decisions you make every day, make the biggest movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| And they're doing a great job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| And we think they're going to be even more focused this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| And not only are we seeing these powerful results, we're gaining momentum in the progress we're making to improve outcomes for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| We've made historic and intentional investments in our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| We've established a strategic plan for Region 5 schools that's already moving the needle for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| And we're seeing support and energy from the community more than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| I want to take a brief moment and share with you about some of the things we're seeing in those spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| First, I want to thank you for approving the budget to the board that made our historic $41 million investment in our people possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| That's both with the salary scale as well as picking up some of the insurance to get to that dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| While entering the school year back, we will start with the highest paid KCS staff in the history of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| And that's definitely worth celebrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| My friend Paula is in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| We talk about this often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| I appreciate her help and their work in this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| But we know that investing in people is more than just salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| When I became superintendent, we established a talent acquisition department within the business and talent division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| a team dedicated to recruiting and retaining the highest quality talent in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| I want to take a moment and recognize Ms. Himmelgarn and also Mr. Moseman, who's probably in the other room right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| for the tremendous work they have done in this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| We set out knowing that traditional hires weren't going to be the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| We recruited Mr. Moseman from Indianapolis to come down and share some ideas from then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| He's done a great job coming up with lots of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| At our new teacher breakfast last week, we celebrated more than 400 new teachers joining the KCS team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| One in particular, a young lady, I'll say that, she'll like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| stopped and waited for me to let me know that she was a 20-year special education veteran teacher from Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=387)|
| 0:06:35| and that she had been watching our district for the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| and we'd finally gotten the pay that could be competitive with what she was making there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| and she came home and was thrilled to be an Adrian Burnett special education teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| I really appreciate her taking time to talk to us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| As of July 31st, which was last Friday, vacancies were down 76 percent compared to this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| Seventy-six of our schools are fully staffed for certified positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| The district as a whole is 99.5 percent staffed for certified positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| We have no openings in ELA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| We have only 11 full-time classroom teaching positions remaining open across the entire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| This time last year, we had 89 if you're looking for a comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| As educators, we know that classrooms are where the magic happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| and why it's so critical that we invest and now have teachers in every classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| I think about just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| We've done a lot to focus on the right work the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| but we know the last two years we've started school and we've had these vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| We've had teaching assistants cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| We've had teachers on their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| The fact that we're starting nearly fully staffed means that certified teachers will be in every classroom across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and that's impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| This isn't in my notes, but I just know this because we continue to look at Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| Region 5 is 95 percent staffed at this point to 13 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| That's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Again, it makes a huge difference when you have trying to make a difference in populations of kids to make the growth they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| I really think the impact of closing these vacancies, retaining teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| and bringing high qualified new teachers into our classrooms cannot be overstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| In the midst of this global shortage, I want our families to know that KCS is staffed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| and ready to welcome our more than 60,000 students back to the classroom on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| Last week also, Region 5 schools kicked off their school year with the first ever Educator Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| What was so special about that was this was an idea that came from our Region 5 Teacher Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| wanting a day just to pull away and work on skills that they could share across the 13 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| So it was a day of professional development designed and led by the lead educators of Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| Just as a reminder, Region 5's strategic plan was created to ensure every student is held to the same academic rigorous standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| as students across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| At the Educator Summit, we took time to review year one objectives in the Region 5 plan and to reflect what's at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| I remember Dr. Murphy was up and he was talking through the Region 5 goals, and he pulled this slide up and everyone was encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| In Region 5, we fell for the year one marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| We fell just seven students short of our third grade reading proficiency goal for year one in the Region 5 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| We fell 66 students short of the eighth grade goal we had for math for year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| So to be clear, we are making progress in Region 5 schools, and I'm proud of the work our educators and students have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| but we know that these are pivotal benchmarks for students, and we can't afford to lose sight of the ambitious goals that we established with the Region 5 community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=559)|
| 0:09:27| As superintendent, I know that we have the right team in the schools and the right leaders in Region 5 to take care of this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| to support every student in their strong future, both in school and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| Finally, I want to recognize the community for the effort and continued support they have for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| As many of you know, Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs hosts an annual school supply slam at Chilhowee Park, and he did on July 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| I was honored once again. It was hot, but I was honored once again. Everything I do with this man is always hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| We did the express conference today, the graduations, but I do like the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| I was honored to join Mayor Jacobs in distributing more than 2,500 back-to-school supply bags for local families and to see many familiar faces along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=600)|
| 0:10:09| Last week, I was honored to attend the Knox Education Foundation with many of the board members who were there, our board members who were there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Their back-to-school breakfast, the event served as an opportunity to share our vision for the 24-25 school year with a broad range of partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| and to recognize Knox County Education Foundation for the tremendous work they do in catalyzing support for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| And just this morning, we hosted our Safe Schools, Safe Students Summit alongside KCS School Security Chief Jason Perriard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| Knox County Sheriff Tom Spangler, and Knoxville Police Department Paul Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| As I shared at that event, keeping students safe is our most important responsibility and one that I do not take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| We are continuing to invest in safety strategies we know will work to protect our students through intentional training, campus infrastructure, and partnerships with local law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=647)|
| 0:10:57| And I want to thank the families of Knox County for continuing to entrust us with their students for their safe learning environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| I know that's a lot of information, but this is some of the amazing work that our team is doing and how excited we are for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| Madam Chair, that concludes my report, but I would like to, if I could, ask Dr. Brown real quick if he could update us on one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| So at this point, I'd like to invite Dr. Brown, who is Assistant Superintendent of Student Success, to give us a brief update on our special education progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=677)|
| 0:11:27| Thank you, Dr. Roswick. Madam Chair, members of the board, I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| I'm excited about the direction of our special ed department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| You will notice tonight on your agenda item 9A under contracts, with board approval, we will begin the work of doing an analysis of our special education department this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=694)|
| 0:11:46| If you look in the contract produced by procurement, there will be four phases of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| We'll start with a comprehensive pre-assessment of the current special education system, design structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| and establish processes to identify specific tasks to be included in the project proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| So we'll look at what are the needs, what have we identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Secondly, phase two will be to identify an alignment between the structural supports and the continuum of services available to students with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=724)|
| 0:12:14| and our district's strategic plan, how we move forward together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| The third step will be for PCG to provide recommendations for changes and actual evidence-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| and will improve efficiency and effectiveness of the services for Knox County schools, students receiving special ed services, and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=747)|
| 0:12:37| And then finally, we'll work in partnership to integrate those recommendations into a three to five year strategic plan for special education programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| The public consulting group will be able to analyze and manage our existing data, including the information that was gathered from our first phase of the student success deep dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| That includes our family focus groups, the educator portal that was created, the task force work, and also the board's resolution that was adopted last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=774)|
| 0:13:04| And from there, obviously, we will develop our comprehensive three to five year strategic plan aimed at improving special ed services and supports to our students and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=784)|
| 0:13:14| So with board approval, our next steps will be to connect PCG with myself and the special ed council to begin developing an understanding of what it is we want to accomplish through this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=794)|
| 0:13:27| We will then share data and findings from our student success deep dive and all those things I just mentioned, the task force recommendations, the board resolution, and the educator portals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=807)|
| 0:13:39| And then we will generate a comprehensive understanding of where we are and where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| So again, I'm excited to see where we're going to go and how we can continually improve in the world of special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| That's awesome. Thank you. I'm looking forward to all that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| And you're right, that was a long update, but we know school is starting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| So it's definitely back to school time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Well, it's you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| So I think this is the last time you have to hear from me tonight, so that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| So thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| You may have heard that we're in the middle of transitioning to a new salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| So in doing so, I just want to say it's been a challenging process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| It is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| You know, I think as we reflected on it, we now realize why this doesn't happen often and it takes decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| It's kind of like a board trying to rezone sometimes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| You don't do it. You don't do it that often because it's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| So I just want to say I applaud our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| You know, we knew this work was going to be hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| It's hard to go into, you know, 25 to 30 years of an existing structure that basically has kind of been held together with duct tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| And to be able to look at that, have the courage to go find a third party to come make sure that we're staying in line with best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| not only to take care of that situation to get folks to the value that they deserve to be at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| but also to put stakes in the future of where we want to go and ensure that we keep folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| And it's great when you don't always get, you know, kind of that immediate feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| but the fact that, you know, where we are with our staffing right now and our vacancy numbers dropped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| I think is proving that it was a very wise investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| But I think you've noticed as we go into year three that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| we're not an administration that shies away at tough decisions if they're the right decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| And investing in our people and our classes, our teachers and our classroom every day, we said time and time again, is our best investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| And so I appreciate you all doing part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| In a second, you're going to hear from our business and talent team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| They're going to update you on where we are in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| And I just want to say I appreciate Ms. Himmelgarn and her division taking this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| Mr. Bolton's been the project lead for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| You'll be hearing a lot from him tonight as we get into some of the details of where those things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| And just want to say again, thank you to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| This is the highest paid staff we've ever started a school year with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| And that's because of the vote that you all made last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Thank you for that. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Ms. Himmelgarn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Madam Chair, Dr. Reiswick, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words before turning it over to Mr. Bolton for an implementation update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=960)|
| 0:16:09| We knew when we asked you a few months ago to make this transition that making a transition of this size in a short amount of time was an ambitious goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=969)|
| 0:16:20| But we also knew that it was the right work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| We've learned a lot through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| And if we had it to do over again, we would make some improvements to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Mr. Bolton's going to talk a little bit about those in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| We know that decisions like these are about people, not just spreadsheets and market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| And while the majority of the people in the district, I think, view the transition positively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| we know that there's a small percentage that experience frustrations throughout the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| And even a small percentage in a district our size is a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| And there's a few things that we could have done better to try to eliminate some of those frustrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| We could have done a better job on the front end of explaining the purpose behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| We're moving from, like Dr. Reiswick said, a very complex salary schedule to one that's a lot more transparent and user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| But I don't think that we focused enough just on how salaries were made under the previous salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| And then we could have done a little bit better about making sure that people knew that the percentage increase they experienced is not a reflection of their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| We know that every position in KCS is important to the mission of KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| But what we learned through Evergreen's study is that some of those were closer to market value than others already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| So that's why there were differences in percentage increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Changes to compensation are deeply personal, and we don't want anyone to be disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| But we also have a responsibility to create a system that respects the taxpayers that fund our district, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| which was part of the reason that we engaged a third party, Evergreen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| I do believe that our new compensation system is both more clear and puts us in a better competitive district with other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1084)|
| 0:18:14| comparable districts around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| The team's worked hard to ensure that not only everyone's paid this year, but paid more than they were last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| And as Mr. Bolton will share, if the board takes action on Thursday, that will increase just a little bit more the pay for some of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1103)|
| 0:18:32| So with that, I think I will turn it over to Mr. Bolton. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| Welcome, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| Thank you for this opportunity, Madam Chair, board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| A few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Let me walk through the process of the implementation, and this was a very, very, very heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| I don't know if you recall in the conversation that Evergreen told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| They said, oh, wow, you're doing it in one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| We said, yeah, we're doing it in three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| So their recommendation, we are the first institution that has done that in a one-year span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| But I just want to remind you of the purpose of this and take just a minute to kind of set right there the objectives of this salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| We wanted to identify the best practices nationally to determine and leverage those strategies to be able to enhance our employee recruitment and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1159)|
| 0:19:29| And I think, as Dr. Reiswick mentioned, with our numbers down in terms of open positions, it seems like it's reaping some benefits early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1169)|
| 0:19:40| But we also want to look internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| We wanted to look across the consistency of our agency, in particular job classifications and their compensation throughout the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| We also wanted to determine market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| I'm going to take a few minutes to kind of walk through exactly what market value is and try to hone in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| and then to simplify the overall existing salary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| And that's what our aim was from the get-go with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| So let's look at market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| What is market value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Market value is that average typical salary of a specific role within a group of similar school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1213)|
| 0:20:23| What we're not talking about is the evaluation or the valuation of a specific person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| That's not what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| It's how that role is paid or a similar role is paid across multiple districts and looking at an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| We actually looked at 19 different school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| We solicited 20, and 19 responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| So we had a great sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| And we looked at the various job classes across that district, made some kind of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| Evergreen made considerations for those and grouped them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| and then made a comparison to our job classes in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| And so when we think about it, market value is actually not an arbitrary number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| There is objective value in what we found in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| And the overall purpose of market value is to provide a fair and competitive compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| as we look to be competitive in the market for talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| That's what we want to do in retaining our talent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| What it's not, what market value is not, it's not an evaluation of an employee's performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| So that is what market value is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| I want to kind of give you just a couple examples that we've noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| We've noticed a lot of people leaving positions to go to the classroom, and I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| We had a person that left our office and went back into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| We also have had that same similar situation happen in other departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| where they've gone back into the classroom, and we think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| Another thing I want to example, I had the pleasure of offering a job to an assistant principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| in a neighboring county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| And in offering that job to that person as he came to us, he was ecstatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| He was getting a $9,000 pay raise for working a month contract less than what he was working in the other school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| And so we felt comfortable about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| That allows us to recruit that talent the way that we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| This is a picture of what, this is just like a little snippet of what we saw with that research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| trying to give you an idea of what you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| So, of course, secretaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| This was an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| All 19 school districts responded to a secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| You'll see what the midpoint, the hourly minimum is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| You'll see the hourly maximum, and you'll see the hourly midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| and you'll see how that aligns specifically with our grade band 109,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| which is where those positions were actually placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1373)|
| 0:23:02| So let's talk about the phases that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| We had that external assessment that Evergreen performed for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| It included staff engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| It looked at job assessment of specific job categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| We know there's a lot of categories across our district that we've got a pretty good handle on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| matches real closely with that of other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| but there are some unique things of our school district that we looked at in that external assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1403)|
| 0:23:31| Evergreen looked at those 19 school districts and then reported out some findings to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| And the process of moving in and the transition of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| we looked at what their solution file had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| We made the implementation, made sure that the data was clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| and implemented that into our new salary schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| We looked at that for the purpose of a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| and making that request to you and felt comfortable with those numbers in doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| and we're gracious that you all granted approval to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| We're currently in phase three of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| We have migrated all new schedules, and we have run one payroll for year long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| That's 255 and 260 employees on the July payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| The rest of our employees will get their first new paycheck on August the 23rd this year in the August paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1460)|
| 0:24:30| I know that's a lot of questions that people have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| When the what we call early July check hit from our 200-day contract folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| they said my salary was not any different, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| The August paycheck will be the first paycheck for this fiscal year for our school-based staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| And phase four is where we're going to be for a good while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| and looking at that continuous improvement of things that we need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| in terms of adjustments that need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| and we have put together a salary committee to look at that compensation strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| for the district going forward and what it looks like at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| This is kind of an overall timeline of the implementation that we had going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| little snapshots of months and times, the things that we've done at various points across the aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1521)|
| 0:25:29| And as you can see, June and July kind of came together as busy times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| for the purpose of going through that process and implementing that exchange process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1533)|
| 0:25:42| You know, we had one goal and we had three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| I said that earlier that Evergreen was surprised because most school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| even school systems smaller than ours, take three years to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| So why did we implement that in one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| It was, you know, as we looked through and weighed the pros and cons of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| it gave us that one opportunity to get all employees at market value at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| And I think that was important when we looked through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| It gave us, we didn't have to prioritize certain job classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| as we looked if we were going to do it over more than one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| And it effectively addressed any compression that currently exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| between job classes and alignment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| And then the ability to look into the future and pay down that debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| and be able to afford it at one time made that implementation an opportune time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| And so that was why one goal and three months to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| So we're in the implementation kind of phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| And in that I want to just point out a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| because I want us to actually look at the raw numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| 100% of our employees received an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| Everyone received an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Some were larger than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| 87.8% of our employees received 4% or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| So that $28 million that we said at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| was dedicated to teachers and it was about a 10% increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| in salaries for teachers in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| It was significant, absolutely significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Here we can see the benefits of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| We can see that 76% of our schools are actually fully staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| That's certified and classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| We can see that every school is staffed over 85%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| But I want you to draw to one number of that red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| If you look at the red boxes compared to the blue box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| the red box would be where we were this time last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| The blue box is where we are this time this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| A significant reduction in those positions when we look at those as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| I also want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| I look back at our vacancy numbers and I went all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Everybody in public education indexes the COVID year as a seminal event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| So if we look at that particular point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| I went back to 2019 pre-COVID and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| what did our numbers look like going into this time of year in 2019?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| And we had 67 total certified vacancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| when the kids entered the school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| The school doesn't start with students until the 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| and we're at 36 vacancies now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| So we've nearly cut that in half from pre-COVID numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| So let's look at the Google form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| There's been a lot of information that's provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I'm sure I know that you all have heard a lot about the Google form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| but that was our attempt to try to engage in an interactive kind of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| between our staff to identify trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| The purpose was for them to have the opportunity to ask for clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and identify concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| As you can see, we had an overwhelming number of submissions to that Google form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| 1,793 submissions to the Google form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| And basically we could boil that down into four themes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| and you could see those there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Pay and step was a concern that a lot of people had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| Job roles and the recognition of previous experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| So let me pause for a second as I look at the top right part of that slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| We marked those submissions resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| and I want to clarify what we mean by a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| A resolution to us was that the employee was transitioned to the appropriate grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| and to the appropriate step with the fidelity of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| So that to us is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| Sometimes to the person on the other side, that was not resolved to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| So we understand, we recognize that that is going to exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| and we're going to work to try to give some kind of clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| to that little bit of dissonance that exists there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| but that is important for me to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| We mentioned resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| We mentioned that the fidelity of the process was followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| and it was correct and rightfully completed for that particular person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| So when we look at that process, when we sent out a lot of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| the only way that we could handle that volume of responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| was to package similar situations together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| address them in a bulk way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| and submit a response back to them in a formed manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| To a lot of people, that was kind of the process and the way that they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| So as we look at our progress as of July 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| we had roughly about 1,702 that we marked resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| and there's still 91 that we're working with at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| We will, though, have those 91 resolved in time for board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| And let me say this, I want to emphasize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| because anything that we see in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| we will correct and we will retro payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| So I want people to understand that we will do everything that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| to make it right by people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| And so when I'm talking about these Google responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| we had to make sure, and this was, you know, hindsight's 20-20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| we can armchair quarterback all day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| but my number one goal was that everybody received a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| Because I understand the pain that it is to not know what you're going to get paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| but it would be even greater to know that you didn't receive a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| So our team has worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| and we've elevated that as a priority to make sure that folks got paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| and they got paid as close to correct as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Knowing that there could be errors, there may be errors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| and we will correct those errors and make them right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| but not getting a paycheck was just something that we were not going to stand for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| So lessons learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| I think that it would have been better if we had done a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| of defining grade and step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| I think a lot of people, as they communicated that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| we weren't necessarily clear in what we meant by grade and step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| and I think we could have done a better job of communicating that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| And, you know, for your edification, grade bands are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| those are the things that run vertically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| and those positions are paired to certain grade bands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| to reflect the market value of those positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| which is different than the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| The steps run horizontally across the salary schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| and they are specifically assigned to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| So you've got, again, grade bands assigned to positions, steps assigned to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| And so when we look at that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| as we transition folks from that old scale onto the new scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| you may recall the process that we went through to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| was how long were they in the position as of FY24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| and what was their current salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| And we slotted them into the scale at the next highest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| whichever was the highest step there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| And that was the transition to the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| And I think we should have done a better job of really defining exactly what that meant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| because that was very confusing for a lot of our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| So I wanted to take a snapshot of what it used to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| because it was very convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| You know, after talking to our consultants with Evergreen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| I dubbed them an honorary PhD for at least understanding the scales that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| because it's amazing to try to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| So I wanted to put together a simple explanation for Mr. Lorem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| And Mr. Lorem was a teacher for eight years and has been an AP for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| So here's the way that we would do that calculation previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| So if you look at KnoxSchools.org, backslash HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| and you go to the FY24 pay schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| you'll see a pretty substantial book, and it'll have a lot of different scales in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And the first thing that you'll see when you turn that page will be the teacher scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| So, for example, Mr. Lorem there would be on step eight of the master scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| So we would look at that master scale, which is what's on a 200-day contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| and that's what it would reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| We would take step eight, and we would divide it by 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Well, APs are on a 221-day contract, so we'd multiply it by 221.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| Then what we would look at, because this is the third year that Mr. Lorem has been an assistant principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| we would go to the appropriate step on the master's admin supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| So depending on if it was elementary, middle, or high, it would be a different value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| And we would take that because that was reflected in 200 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| We would divide it by 200 days and multiply it by 221.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| And the sum of those two numbers would be Mr. Lorem's annual salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| So with this process, what we have done, if you look at the difference now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| the grade band for Mr. Lorem would be 126.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| If this is his third year, then you would look over at step three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| and that would be the position that he would find himself in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| We would look also to determine about his salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| but that is an oversimplification of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| and so that everybody can see that that particular position falls at the market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| Here's a few more examples when we're looking, and just something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| These were examples that we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| We used the Google form to try to identify certain trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| If we saw multiple responses that were saying the same thing, we looked into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| to determine was the data that we had, was it good data, are there trends in the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| So here's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| We got Ms. Ipsum, and she was a secretary at KCS for 11 years at the end of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| Before, she was on step 11 of the administrative secretary scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| Now, when the transition happened and the first notice she got, she was on step 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| Well, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| This is an error, and she was corrected to step 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| and if this is the case, those folks should immediately reach out to HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| and we're continuously going through our data to make sure that we can do compares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| to catch as many as we can, even those that submitted and those that didn't submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| So that was an example there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| Let's look at Mr. Dolar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| That was a custodian for 18 years at the end of FY24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| and as you know, the custodian scale was topped out at step 14 previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| So now our custodian scale has expanded out to step 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| so Mr. Dolar will find himself on step 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| This is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| He's in the correct spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| So as you look at some of those job classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| and I'll say this in just a minute when we look at those slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| but it's important for me to say this as we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| You'll see in those job classes that expanded from 14 to 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| they probably got the largest increase on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| because we have a number of employees that have been with us a long, long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| that get the benefit of those additional steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| in addition to their grade being moving to market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Finally, let's look at Ms. Amet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Ms. Amet is a speech-language pathologist for KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| for 14 years at the end of FY24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| So she was on step 14 previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| and then as they transitioned to that, she would transition to step 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| This is also correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Another lesson that we learned is communication is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| Communication is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| We knew that going into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| but as we were going through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| we realized that that was an area where we should have done better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| we should have staffed for it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| but we had this competing narrative of making sure people got paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| and the paycheck to make sure everything was correct on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| One of the things, as I went through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| the Google form became very difficult to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| We should have had greater hindsight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| onto how that we could group those more easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| into areas where we could address those on a much easier basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| a little less free response, have an opportunity for free response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| but also anticipated what the potential issues would have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| and that would have been something that I would have definitely done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| differently from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| We would have benefited greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| our department would have benefited greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| if we would have had the opportunity to increase manpower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Hiring season is our peak season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| It's our busiest time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| And we process a lot of transitions during that time of year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| so it was less than ideal for us to take on this task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| So that limited our capacity in terms of reaching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| and the things that we wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| Another thing, hindsight, when I was looking through and reflecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| is the fact that I really wish that we had had more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| involved from the initial phase and even from the consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| so that there was more people than just the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| and being involved from the get-go when we started the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| from what did the files look like going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| what did the files look like coming out, and had a larger group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| It sure would have cut down on the transfer of knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| at that point in time if there were more people involved from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| And then, again, we should have more broadly communicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| that certain job classes were already closer to market value than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| And I think that we would have benefited greatly from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| So as we look at these, these are some lessons that we've learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| and some changes that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| We have expanded the implementation beyond just HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| to include some additional departments inside of business and talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| to increase capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| That has proven a benefit to try to make sure that we hit those important dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| And another thing that we've started doing is establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| some progressive communication opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| to kind of further address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| We submitted a second Google form that kind of allowed for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| to shepherd those things more appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| and address those concerns more readily in the middle of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| And that's kind of helped us look at those specific issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| And you can kind of see the spread of what those concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| We also started going with individual phone calls to respondents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| to the greatest extent we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| As you can imagine, some of those phone calls have been in excess of 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| And we want to make sure that people's heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| And the downside of this whole system, I will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| the whole implementation I feel very comfortable about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| when the paychecks start rolling out on August the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| But the one thing that I'm very disappointed at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| is the impersonal nature it appears to a lot of people that it's come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| And we want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| We want to be able to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| August the 10th is a big date for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| August the 5th is our payroll deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| And in August the 10th, we want to make sure that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| we've got to have all of our payroll things ready to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| so we can start running edits and get the payroll paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| After August the 10th, I'm going to set up, well, I have set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| I've set up a bookings link, a team's booking link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| that will be submitted to all people that have responded to the Google form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| That will be in 15-minute increments that people can respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| and we'll give them individualized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| I will try to, well, I will be in at least 70 of those a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| so that we can respond to as many people as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Because in that process, that is probably the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| well, that is definitely the one part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| that I would like to have an opportunity to do again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| And so, again, after August the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| that is the plan to have that bookings link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| and submit it to our folks to give them an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| to schedule time with us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| So as we're entering phase four, our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| we've invested significantly in the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| as much as possible in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| And as you know, as they transitioned over to a plus one on that step placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| we have received higher than expected TESA allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| as well with local sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| And so the recommendation that you all will be looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| I think it's item 10F on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| will be to grant that same step placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| or that same plus one to all employees on the general scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| that transitioned with us from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| So that is a great opportunity to treat the general scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| exactly the way that the teachers were treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| So I want to give you an example of what that looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| If you look at this bar graph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| this is what it looks like when we're taking up that $41 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| 15.6% custodial pay increase, 23.9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| And you can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| And you can see that in this nice snapshot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| we can see that some of our positions were closer to market value than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| That's reflective of that difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| But that item, if you all approve tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| will move from, again, it's cost value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| from $41 million to $44.46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| But it will take 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| so our employees making 4% or more will go from 87.8% up to 95%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2696)|
| 0:45:05| And this is what that means to a custodian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| You're talking about a 2.8% increase on average for custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| You're talking about a 2.5% increase for school secretaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| You're talking about a 2.4% increase for educational assistants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| a 2.3% increase for instructional coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| a 3.2% increase in our food service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| and a 2.2% increase for our assistant principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| So this would be, should you all act affirmatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| well, when next we meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| these will be the average increases for those job classes at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2738)|
| 0:45:48| So these are our next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Like I mentioned, the August payroll is our upmost priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Mr. Bolton, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| I just noticed there's some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Do you all want to answer questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| On the last slide, just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| The red is an additional on top of what they've already received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| So the top number would be the total average increase for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| That's a great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| So if you go back to, say, for example, assistant principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| right now as is, 4.8% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| If you all act affirmatively on TANF on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| that would give them a 2.2% increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| which rounds them up to 7% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Sorry, miss, I want to see your lights on too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| It's been on a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| I can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| So what are our next steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Again, we will continue to work for payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| We want to make sure, because our number one priority is that people get paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| and it's as close to being accurate as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| We will continue to resolve any remaining questions, concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| and make those changes as necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| and provide any of that information when the requested changes are not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| We're going to continue to work with our compensation committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| to monitor the implementation of our salary study recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| and transition to the new scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| And so, again, pending board action of the item on TANF on Thursday is what you'll see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2830)|
| 0:47:19| Let me draw this to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Folks that have been paid in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| we will, if you choose to approve that TANF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| what we will do is we will retroactively pay those folks that were paid in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| but we're going to be a month behind on that retro pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| and it will be in September when that retro pay is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| We've worked through the implementation to make sure that we've got all things in order for the August payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2863)|
| 0:47:53| so that September payroll would also include the retro pay for those that you choose to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| I've had well over 100 folks that I've talked to about concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| and I don't think they're reaching out to me because they like me better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| I think it's because they know that I understand their pay scale because I was here for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| And the concerns that they have had for the past four months have been very emotional for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2909)|
| 0:48:39| So I appreciate, Scott, that you have, the way I wrote this down is not how I mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| I appreciate that you have felt it personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| that you have taken a personal initiative to take care of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| Not that I want you to feel it personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| but I think you have made an extreme effort to work with all of the people that have come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2939)|
| 0:49:12| On the things learned, I would really like to have seen, on the things learned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| bringing all of the information to the board on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| Had all of this information been formulated in a way that was ready to present to the board on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2963)|
| 0:49:33| I think you would have seen a lot of the problems instead of ending up in the middle of all the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2973)|
| 0:49:44| That said, I have requested that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| I requested it verbally in two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| I requested it in writing two months ago, and I asked that it be given to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| and it has not been given to the board yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| I will be asking a court to help me get that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Looking at market value, I think we are going to be having a lot of work to do while we are in phase four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| We know that schools in general tend to pay below what a person would make in any other career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3015)|
| 0:50:25| When we take 20 schools and compare them for market value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| we are not comparing the market value of those skills in the greater community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| I think it is a fallacy to look at it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| because we are not paying market value for what that individual could make with their skills in some other career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3041)|
| 0:50:54| A question I have is, how many total positions do we have right now, approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| Approximately, I am almost afraid to, I think maybe 7,400, but I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| We will get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| How many did we have last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| I will tell you what, Ms. Owen, I am not prepared to say that, so I do not want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| That is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| I am going to say that it was significantly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| I think when we look at only the difference in openings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| we have to realize that we have fewer openings because we have fewer positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| I think we need to take that into consideration when we are looking at all of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| When we are talking about 702 that have been resolved and 91 that we are still working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3103)|
| 0:51:51| the first time I got a significant piece of the data, I only got half of our employees in the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| It makes me wonder if this number is correct at well under 2,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| it makes me wonder why 4,000 were withheld from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| I think there is a fallacy in the formula when we are looking at people who have changed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| I want to use a principal as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| If a principal has been employed with us, they have been a teacher for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| they have been maybe an AA, then an AP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| all of that experience is part of the experience that brings them to be a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3149)|
| 0:52:38| All of that experience counts when they take that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| If we have a person who had all of that prior experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| maybe they had 15 years of experience before they became a principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| and another person who had five years experience before they became a principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| but when they become a principal, they are going to be paid the same rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| That does not seem where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3181)|
| 0:53:09| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Just for clarity because a lot of people have asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| When you are looking back, and this is highly technical so I will high level it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| when you are looking at the transition to that scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| there are a lot of things that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| As you recall, it is either their current salary, their FY24 salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| or their position in the job class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| The reason why I bring that up is because all of those things that you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| are embedded in where they were paid previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| That was what was used to place them into the scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| either by salary or by time of position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| I will give you a case in point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| To my surprise, we have a number of APs who have been in the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| for greater than 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Those folks that were placed into their respective grade bands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| went all the way to the top of the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| If we had slotted them by the salary, it would be maybe 13 or 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| A lot of people have said, I have lost all of my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| or something similar to what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| but that was what was embedded under their current salary that moved them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| Now moving forward, all of those things go in as we look and progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| from being a teacher to being an AP to being a what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| All of that is embedded at that base level as a person progresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| throughout the scales and the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| I get that that is all embedded, but when we take the people who are all embedded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| and then the people who are coming into it, it is going to be skewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| Before I do some very wrong math here on this next part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| where does the scale for principals top out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| Let's say it's at 20 years just for conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| All general scales top out at 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| When we're looking at retirement, if we have a person who is a principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| and they have been working with us for 25 years, they are five years from retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| If anyone doesn't know this, your five highest paid years make up your retirement amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| That's how it's figured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Let's say if I worked making $20,000 my last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| but I had made $30,000 the five before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| then it would be the $30,000 that would base my retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| If we're looking at a person who has worked with us for 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| and they are thinking about their five highest paid years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| when we come in and put them on a lower step basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| than what they would have been otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| they may have five years of service left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| but they have 10 more years before they would top out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| That's lowering their potential retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| It's something that I think maybe folks haven't considered at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| One thing, can I address that just real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| It's saying that I understand where you're coming from on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| but it does give those folks a progression of five years and an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| as where there's no guarantee of increases from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| So that's kind of the thought as you progress through the scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| if that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| I get that, but then it's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| while it's a good idea to incentivize people to stay longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| I feel like this is almost forcing them to stay longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| and that's not a position I think people want to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| so that they can optimize their retirement amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| and having to work five years longer than they would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| working 35 years instead of 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| So I think that's something that we really need to look at in that phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| while we're looking at what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| I know that this is an agenda item on our regular agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| but it's also come up in the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| so I'm just going to ask the question now because you already got the slides handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Can you go back to the slide that I already asked you the previous question on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| Yeah, that one right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| So because we're being asked to vote on the additional $3.4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| which is basically an 8% increase over the total of the $41 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| so it's an additional 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| A couple questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| So those six different positions, are those for the purpose of example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| or are those the only six positions that would be affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| For the purpose of example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| For the purpose of example, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| And so what would this $3.4 million impact every position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| potentially not individuals, not every individual, but every position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| or is it going to be only applied to certain positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| No, all positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| All positions, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| I just want to make sure that was the case because if it was limited to these six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| I then would want to know, well, why is it limited to these six and not the other ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| And that may address my second question, which was really the more important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| You said several times, and I understood this I think throughout the whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| that one of the number one goals of this was to help get positions closer to market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| And so if we're saying we're going to add, don't get me wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| I'm not saying I don't want to give people more money, I get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| but if the goal was to get people close to market, and now we're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| but now we're going to push it even beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| are we somehow hurting ourselves in terms of our objective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| Again, I understand from an individual standpoint as an employee, more money is more better, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| But I'm just thinking from a system standpoint, are we working against ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| And again, I appreciate going in with the willingness to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| and kind of think about problem solving and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| and really appreciate just what Ms. Owen said too, talking about the personal nature of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| I mean, every call that's been received and every Google form that's been received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| that's what it's about because I'm feeling it right here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| I mean, that's what it's about, and you all recognize that, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| So my question about market value, does this answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| It's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| And if it's okay, I'm going to go back a few slides because I want to stay right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| This is where we didn't do a good job of defining this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| When we talk about market value, we're talking about market value at the grade bands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| not necessarily at the steps that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| So I'll give you a case in point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Let's say, for example, and these are raw numbers, but let's say I brought over to the scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| and I was moved to market value at a, maybe a, I used Ms. Amet, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| that was moved to step 14 and then came on to the new scales at step 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| Well, in that particular, when I look back at that, that was a 7% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| But with that additional step placement, it gave a 9.6% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| But it honored, it was the opportunity to honor that step in a similar fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| that we honored the teachers plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Yeah, so I appreciate that because that's actually where the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| and the people that have reached out to me, that's actually been the biggest, greatest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| And so what I hear you saying is that this is an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| this resolution that you all are providing for the board to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| you feel like is the opportunity to address that particular concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Ms. Mulcorn, I know you have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, I think that you just cleared it up, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| I know that Mr. Watson and Mr. Bolton were speaking the same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| But when you said all positions, it's the transition to the CERT I and CERT II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| has already been granted the plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| So this would be all positions on the general scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| I'm sorry, Mr. Watson, were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| I think what's important in what you're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| is that it's also a question of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| If the board will go back and look at the video that's online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| explaining how an employee can determine what their pay will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| it very clearly shows going up one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| And so I think if we are to be truly transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| I think what we are being asked to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| is to match what we have said we were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3714)|
| 1:02:01| Mr. Templeton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Yeah, I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| I mean, I know this is a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Thank you to Ron or whoever had the foresight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| to pay down a bunch of debt early so we'd have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| I mean, that was just a genius move, a smart move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| to have the resources to be able to make this move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you to your team for doing all the work and figuring all this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| and continuing to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Thank you, Scott, for being willing to sit in on 70 15-minute meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| with people who deeply care about their salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| So I just huge shout out to everyone that put in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| Frankly, we had the easiest part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| We just go, oh, we want to give teachers raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I mean, that was an easy yes for us as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| And you all put in the work to figure out the finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| and then to figure out the scale and get it all worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| and get it implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| And so I just want to thank you and Ms. Hemingar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| and the rest of that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| I'm sure there's a whole bunch of people that deserve thanks for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| So thank you guys very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| I echo that, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Next on the agenda we have Dr. Wilson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| is going to do a presentation on the early release feedback and next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| I know several of us have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| So I appreciate you putting this together and gathering that info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Actually, Corey is going to help me a little bit with parts of this as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| because it was a partnership between the academics division and strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| and REA and doing some surveying around this topic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| So just to take us back, we've talked about early release days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| a couple of different times in the course of the last year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| Just as some reminder of kind of where did this come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| this was originally adopted by the board based on a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| from a committee of about 11 principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| and then several district office folks that participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| in kind of some thinking around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| Back in May of 2022 is when this was originally approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| And what it originally was slated for was to provide some embedded time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| for our principals to provide some professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| professional learning for their staff that was really time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| that they didn't currently have in their calendar, in their schedule to utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| And so this was a way proposed to tackle that as a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| And we did that in a way that was considered to be a pilot for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| And so we've now reached the end of that two-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| As we've gotten into talking about calendars for the current year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| and for next year, some questions were raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| about continuing to use those days in the way that they've been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| And again, as a reminder, the original thought and proposal included six days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| that were essentially two-hour early release days built into the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| We made that happen in the calendar by using two of our inclement weather days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| you may recall, taking this from ten in a normal year to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| And so in 22-23, we were able to follow that full planned calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| of those days using all six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| Last year, you may recall that we only used three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| because we had some unfortunate and unexpected snowfalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| that kept us out of school longer than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| So we were able to reclaim those three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| to help build back in some instructional time along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| So again, goal being and suggested by our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| to provide them with some PD time for their staff and their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| So based on that, again, as we've talked about calendars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| we talked about gathering some feedback from our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| and from our teachers and our principals to give us some additional guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| on kind of after two years where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| And so Ms. Lautner is going to come and talk to you about that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3936)|
| 1:05:46| You'll get all the presentations tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| I will try to go quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| So if you all recall, we did put out a survey to families, to school staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| and to principals at the tail end of last school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| We were coming up on the closure of that two-year pilot that Dr. Wilson mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| And the goal of that survey was really to assess the perspectives of our family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| and of our staff members as they relate to primarily the continuation of early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| To do that, we looked at questions involving the impact of early release days on families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| perspectives on what's an appropriate number of early release days to meet those goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| and what's the best use of those early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| So I want to take a quick moment just to review our findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| And before we dive into those findings, I do want to say this was actually a very well-responded-to survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| Our response rate is better than we generally see for surveys of this kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Responses from families numbered over 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| For school-based staff, a little bit shy of 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| And more than half of our principals did respond as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| So I won't get into the actual breakdown of each of those categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| but you can see that on the screen as well, just who is represented in those three stakeholder categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| And so here's what we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| So first and foremost, should we continue early release days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| So in response to that question, the answer was largely yes across all three stakeholder groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| And I want to call your attention to the teal slivers of the pie chart there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| so that dark teal and the lighter teal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Those are your yes responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| You can see that principals were, of the three stakeholder categories, the most apt to say yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| we would like to continue early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Our families were actually the second most likely stakeholder group to advocate for the continuation of early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| Our staff also agreed with that continuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| but that was the group that we saw that would like to see more changes in the usage of early release days should we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| So again, the orange slivers are your nos, the teals are your yes responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| We also wanted to know, you know, what is the impact on families?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| This is a change, a departure from our normal schedule, what we've done every year prior to two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| So in asking the question, do early release days create any challenges for your families or for your family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| Our no responses were in orange again, so you see about 41% of our respondents said no, not at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| no significant impact to my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| You did see about 60% of our respondents saying yes, I did face some challenges as they relate to early release days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| but only about a quarter of our respondents said that they faced significant challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| We also asked, what are the challenges that you're confronted with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| And so this was something that respondents were able to flag all that applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| Of all the various categories of challenges, respondents most frequently stated that it was the disruption to routine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| that was really a challenge to them and to their family, with transportation being the second most highly reported challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| child care the third, and that loss of instructional time being the fourth most highly reported challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4135)|
| 1:09:04| And so we really wanted to ask folks, you know, if it were up to you, how many early release days would we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| Would we stick with our current model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| Would we transition to two full days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| Would we look at four half days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Would we have no early release days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| Or is this just something you don't have an opinion on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| And so what you'll see on the bar chart there is all three stakeholder categories represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| You've got families in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| Our responses from staff members are in teal, and then you see responses from principals in green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| And you also have an average of each of those stakeholder groups as they relate to those response categories in orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4175)|
| 1:09:43| And so what you'll see is that the highest, the most favorable responses really concentrated around two full days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| the difference being principals, you know, really preferred that four half days opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| We can extrapolate and make some guesses as to why, just in terms of the usage of early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| The four half days was the second most popular choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| with continuation of our current model being the third most popular choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| We also asked our staff, so our school leaders and our school staff, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| what would you prefer to see early release days used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| Same breakdown here, teal is staff and green is principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| with the orange number being the average across those stakeholder groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| So the most popular usage for early release days was collaboration with colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| You can see there's a little bit of discrepancy there, though, between staff and principal responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| So I'd say kind of the overall, the highest concentration of responses is probably that 73.85%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| If you want to pick kind of that average there that best reflects our staff responses for lesson planning and preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| So that was a lot of information delivered very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| So this is kind of the bottom line across all stakeholder groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| On average, this is what we found from our surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Respondents tended to agree there would be merit in continuing early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| Staff and principals, particularly our school-based staff, would like to see changes made and how that time is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| Two full half days was the most popular choice, followed very closely thereafter by four half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| Collaboration with colleagues was the most preferred use of early release days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| followed by lesson planning and preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| Impact on families varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| So 41% of families, again, reported no challenges with early release days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| but about a quarter of our respondents did report a significant challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| And so disruption to routine was the most frequently cited of those challenges, followed by transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| So that was what we witnessed from the surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| I'm going to turn it back over to you, Dr. Wilson, to talk a little bit more about what they're going to do with those results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| I'm going to just pause right here, Reverend Butler and Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| I know you guys have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| I did have a question of clarification of you have a full half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| What is a full half day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| Between a half day and a full half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| I think in comparison, and Corey, correct me wrong if I'm misspeaking for your slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| but a full half day being like the traditional, like we'll have a half day for the first day of school that ends with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| let's see, oh, it's a true half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| The early release days have been a two-hour early release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| A traditional full half day has been something that's been in our calendar forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| The early release day and that schedule was a different schedule coming into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| I'll say, Dr. Wilson, if you'll take us backward in the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| I think my accent might have led us astray here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| So four half days is what I was going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| So you have two full days and four half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Yes, four half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Sorry, I will enunciate better in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| I think your slide is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| You say two full half days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| Two full half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| That should be two full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Two full half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| So that's what was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| Two full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| So that's a typo is what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| So either two full days off or four half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Thank you, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| We will make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| I guess that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| I don't know what a full half day is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| I was working hard to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| I thought I knew what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| But sometimes it's just a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| There's a back to school bar problem right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| And sometimes I add to that confusion, Reverend Butler, so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| So we'll get this back on the rails here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| So based on the feedback that we received through the survey, and I'll say just anecdotally too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| I think these are conversations we've had over the last couple of years with our teacher's council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| with our family council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| We've heard feedback from that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| Just some things to consider, I think, as we're thinking about what a proper response might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| You know, for the 24-25 year, obviously we've got a published calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| The schools have already begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Principals have begun making their PD plans, which they submit for each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| which certainly include the early release days as part of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| Families have made plans for providing transportation, pick up all the things as they look at the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| And then obviously our aftercare providers have some change in schedule that they have to be equipped for in preparation for these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| The disruption to routine was something that we heard a lot in the family feedback especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4452)|
| 1:14:19| And there are some ways that we can address that without some significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| So as I'll show you an example of that, keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| And then using our time intentionally, our staff and our principals expressed, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| pretty much a positive feeling about it, even though they suggested some changes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| So modifying how we might use our time could be part of our proposed solution as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| And again, can do that without changing the calendar drastically to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| So again, based on the feedback, based on requests for us to look at this again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| and to think about some ways that we might make this a more beneficial experience for all the parties that are involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| here is a proposal that we bring for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| There is an action item on the agenda this month for discussion and possible decision making around the early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| And we feel like, again, based on the feedback we received, this is a good solution to consider as we think about change to that for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4507)|
| 1:15:16| So what we would suggest is moving to the four half days, which was one of the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| Those are full half days, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| If you're wondering, moving to the half days was one of the options that we put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| We would do that by getting rid of or removing the August 16th and the January 22nd early release days from the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4528)|
| 1:15:36| August 16th is very early in the school year for our principals and for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| We're just back on contract at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| And then coming back in January, the January 22nd, Wednesday, falls on the same week as the Martin Luther King holiday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| So that would be being out of school on Monday, back on Tuesday and out of half day or two hour early release on that January 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| Just to kind of give you some context around those two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| We can do that by continuing to utilize the two stockpile days that we currently use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| So because we were doing that two hour early release, we could use two days to earn six days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| Because this would be a true half day, we can do that by still utilizing those same two stockpile days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| No change in terms of that number of snow days and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| Structure is another thing to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| And this would actually end up moving us to a place where we have three full hours for that time for our staff to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| And I'll say anecdotally again, one of the things early on, and I think there was some communication on that, that misled I think some of our teaching staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4587)|
| 1:16:36| was that they were requesting and asking for more independent time to work on classroom tasks and maybe grading and planning on their own that they would like to bake into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4596)|
| 1:16:46| And it really was truly designed for some principal led, collaborative activities, things like that in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| And so as we think about expanding that time for the day, for that true half day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| we would suggest a structure that allows for the principal to continue with about two hours of planned activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| which can be more professional learning, data analysis, collaboration, maybe extension of PLCs, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| But then also bake into that time an hour for independent teacher planning, application and classroom tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| Another thing we heard through our teacher councils a year ago, I can say specifically, was when we're doing all of this new learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| sometimes the opportunity to transfer that back to my classroom, to take it and do something with it that allows me to apply it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| I don't have the time to do that or the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| So again, an opportunity to think differently about the structure and to answer to that need that we have heard over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4650)|
| 1:17:38| So we feel like this proposal does minimize some of that disruption to routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| We move from six days that families would be having to plan for to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| And we move to a schedule that they're a little more familiar with in the regular flow of a school year, that half day schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| It minimizes the changes that may already for the plans that already may be in place for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| You know, principals would have some shuffling around to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| but could could figure out ways to modify the plan to accommodate for the for the two days per semester rather than the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4682)|
| 1:18:10| It still has the embedded opportunities throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| And so taking you back to the to the feedback, if you notice with the principals there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| their response on the two full days for the year was fairly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| Again, my conjecture. But again, knowing where this came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| this idea of being able to build those opportunities in over time throughout the year so that you can be responsive to data that comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4703)|
| 1:18:30| so that you can be adjusting as you need to with some of those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| If you just have those two full day opportunities, it limits that a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| So that's just some some conjecture on my part around maybe what that what that data was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| It provides added time for collaboration, lesson planning, individual teacher needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| So baking that in for the teachers to have some individual decision making in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| It does not cost us any additional inclement weather days, as I mentioned already for that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| So next steps. Again, there is an agenda item for this month for you guys to consider this proposal or other actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| It's decision and possible discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| And so an opportunity for you guys to potentially to revise the schedule again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| Just to remind you, that would be dropping that first day for each semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| If we talked about the twenty four, twenty five school year and again coming off the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| it's probably a good time to think about changes to how we do it and how often we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| And then would give us this year suggestion monitor to see if we're moving closer to the target that we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| potentially surveying staff and families and things again through the course of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| and then making the necessary changes to the twenty five, twenty six calendar in the spring based on some of that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| So what questions do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| Just obviously you all dug into the analysis of the data much more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| So I'm just kind of ripping here a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| So on the slide that talks about continuing of early release days and the findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| it says that forty eight point nine percent said to keep it basically of families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4800)|
| 1:20:07| But then when we look at it, it's the one whether or not they face challenges or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4807)|
| 1:20:16| That's only there's only a seven percent difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| So that stands out to me that only seven percent of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| There's no way to know if it's the same people responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Obviously, but you would assume if you're facing challenges, you're probably not one of the guesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| Right. But seven percent of them were right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| So seven percent of the families who face some kind of challenges had to also say yes to get to that percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| Right. So to me, that's telling is that it seems like the majority of people who face challenges also are saying likely don't keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4837)|
| 1:20:47| I have no way of knowing exactly if it's the same people. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Also, then, when you look at preference in terms of release days, in terms of the way we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| the option that you're proposing is the one that's least exciting to families, which is four half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| And I would think the reason that probably is is because one of the things they're talking about is disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| And so four half days, I think what they're saying is it's a lot harder to plan for than two full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| Like I just know my kids are going off and doing something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| So I appreciate the analysis and all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| And I know there's lots of ways to read it. And I know there's lots of ways to kind of create a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| I mean, to me, I think we need to be really conscious about the impact on families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| I'm glad we've asked them. I mean, to me, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| I don't even know that I would have brought up what I just said if the proposal was two full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| But it seems like to me it's a very close percentage of families that are facing problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| Also, that's close to the same percentage of ones that are like, get rid of it. Makes sense, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| Like I've got lots of problems with it. I don't want you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| But if you're going to ask me how you want me to do it, if you're going to ask me how I think you should do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| I'm going to give you a response, but then you're going to choose the one I like the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| That's the way I read the data. And again, please don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| This is not about pointing fingers. I know you can carve this stuff up lots of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| But that's my quick read of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| Yeah, I think my only response to that would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| I mean, obviously, in making the decision around the model, it is the one that was least favorable to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| As a matter of fact, I mean, over the current model, there's the six days of asking them to have transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4941)|
| 1:22:28| all those things that was voted as more favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| That all being said, at the end of the day, too, like utilization of the days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| how they're meant to impact, I guess, the overall development and program at the school is certainly a part of the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4956)|
| 1:22:45| I mean, as we think about why we do those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| But back to your point, I want to be very conscious of how it impacts all stakeholders when we think about meeting that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| Yeah, and I get from a staff perspective, whether it's staff or principals, why having more of them throughout the year is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| Because you can spread it out instead of trying to get a lot of bang for your buck in one setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| I totally get that from a staffing standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| But our core constituency is our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| I would also say that, sorry, I don't know if I can chime in or not, but if I could chime in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| I would also just say that this is part of what makes kind of a static survey really imperfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| in that we're capturing a lot of information that is contingent on what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| And so one of the challenges with this particular distribution of feedback is that we don't know yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5009)|
| 1:23:38| when families are weighing in on this, whether or not we're continuing early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| And so, I mean, yes, to your point, we could dig a little bit more deeply, and we'd be happy to do that if that would help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| just in terms of which respondents made up which of these categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| But, yeah, the deeper we dug, the less relevant those kind of parceled out pieces of information seemed to become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| because families were balancing so many different variables, and so were our staff, when they were taking this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5040)|
| 1:24:08| Ms. Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| I first just want to say thank you for being innovative and trying something new to see if it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| I've definitely heard a lot from families that are, of course, not happy, because that's usually what you hear, and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5058)|
| 1:24:27| And I really appreciate the data that you've presented with us, this presentation, and all the work that you've done for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| I'm also curious about the four half days and the families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| and I'm really curious if they understood that that half day would be the same as the other half days in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5078)|
| 1:24:47| and that if they were given the choice between just the two full days and the four half days, what they would choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| because it's so hard to know are the families that answered so low on the four half days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5094)|
| 1:25:03| is that the sample that this is an extreme circumstance for them or puts them in a hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5103)|
| 1:25:11| or are those families that were just clicking through and that were like, ah, I'd rather have two full days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| It's so hard to know, but I am probably between those two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5116)|
| 1:25:23| And certainly speaking as a mom and planning and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| and thinking about how I receive my kids when they come home from the early release days versus even a half day or regular school day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5127)|
| 1:25:35| I would prefer one of those, and that's what I generally hear from other families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| So thank you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| From a staff retention perspective, I think it's really important to notice that only 26.5% of our staff are pleased with early release days as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5147)|
| 1:25:59| and comparing those same numbers, 73.5% would either not have them or yes with changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5159)|
| 1:26:08| and that aligns with the 73.85% that want lesson planning and preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5168)|
| 1:26:16| When this was first presented to us, if board members remember, it was presented to us as time for teachers to plan and prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5176)|
| 1:26:26| And at that time, we all said that if it was for teachers to plan and prepare, we supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5186)|
| 1:26:34| It was going to be a bunch of other stuff pushing into their planning time that we didn't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| So if we are going to have early release time, we need to make it useful to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| Otherwise, I think we are really shooting ourselves in the foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| I also want to thank you for all the work going into taking a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| One is the full day is synonymous with a teacher's work day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| Is that the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| So this would be an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Essentially, it would be a school-based, I guess you would call it, in-service day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| By state's rule, that's how we would classify it as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| So it's a day that – because this is preferred use of early release days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| but one of the choices is not an early release day but just a full day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| The second thing, and that's something that I have heard from parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| and I heard from a particular grandparent who picked up a grandson from middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| He much prefers full days than half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| I can tell you he personally feels that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| I'm certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| I got one of those too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| So the second thing is using time intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5272)|
| 1:28:00| One of the things that I heard was, once again, that staff prepared time to prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5280)|
| 1:28:09| and that there was a feeling that – and I'm not throwing stones at anyone –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| but there was a feeling that a lot of times the administration, it was just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| we have to do something so let's see what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| And you really haven't looked at what was the significance, what improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| what was the gain of having that training that way on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| What did it do for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| How did we measure that it was effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| They can – obviously staff who have time to prepare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| they have their own way of measuring their significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| But that's the issue of when you have – particularly you have the two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| you have to be very intentional to get significance out of two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| So that's one of the reasons why a full day to me seems like it's more effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| than three hours, one hour to prepare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| and two hours for you to have something significant for everyone to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| That just seems like that's a hard task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| Yeah, and I'll say, I mean, again, as a two-year pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| we've had the chance to do this nine times in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| I think that's a significant factor in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| After year one, we heard feedback similar to what you're labeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| I think we gave additional clarifying guidance to our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| We've tried to really leverage our school improvement plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| that we've been developing to be a factor in how we're thinking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| professional development plan and how we're developing that over the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| Not a perfect system, and certainly user results may vary across the district, I'm certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| But, again, it's a new effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| I think that when it was brought to the board originally, however it was presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| it was brought as an innovative solution to an issue that schools had faced over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| And it's likely we have not gotten that perfect yet in that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| So part of why we're bringing this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| And for you guys to consider, I think all the points that you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| are points to consider in what we decided to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Yeah, I would just challenge Cora.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| Yeah, you're the queen of all the data, so to dive into that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| I mean, I'd hate to choose the one that 91 principals like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| but the families of 60,000 students didn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| I mean, that would not look like we're listening to the families, I guess, would be the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| So I know data can be cut up in a number of different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| and I don't know that I can speak into what the best solution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| And I think there's some value, obviously, in the early release days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| whatever variation we do choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| But I'd hate for it to look like, hey, we took the survey, all the families hated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| but we're going to do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| So I'd just hate for that kind of response or that thought to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Well, I appreciate you guys taking this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| I know we've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| We talked about it in the GenoSET meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| how you have a pilot program with great intentions and you're into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| What does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| What worked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| What didn't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| How can we tweak it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| What can we do better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| What is working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| So I appreciate you diving into that and then bringing us these solutions as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| so that we can provide these for our step-in families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| We have a lot going on tonight, a lot of good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| Custodial staffing update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| So currently we have 43 openings, 59 schools are fully staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| two high schools are at 50%, 20 of our schools have less than 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| and we have 11 schools that are at 35% or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| I will say we have about 10 custodians that are right now in the hopper for the screening process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| so I'm excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| I'd also like to give a shout-out to Ms. Hemelgarn and her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| I think everyone on the Board knows that the work they've done is incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| And I would also like to add our school nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| We were at around 50 vacancies back-to-back years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| So having this position, that was a big concern of mine, and we are now at 15 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| So Brett Foster has worked very closely with our HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| but they have done an incredible job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| And anything that needed to be corrected, they have corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| I've been in multiple schools and had individual conversations with our custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| and they seem to be very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| Oh, good. That's good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| They work so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Mr. Triplett, legislative update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Mr. Dupler, Chief of Staff Christy Woods, myself, and a couple other Board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| attended the TSBA Summer Law Institute and gave us a good presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| a thorough presentation on all of the legal changes, legal happenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| that came out of the last legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| I know Mr. Dupler and the staff are working to take some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| and convert that into policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| So I look forward to seeing all that on August 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| That meeting is at 10 a.m. in the community room here in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| but I look forward to kind of seeing the end results of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Ms. Christy, Strategic Plan Committee update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| It's a very short report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| I'm happy to report it's a short report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| The Strategic Plan Committee will meet again on Wednesday, August 14th at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| with representatives from Milan, Chicago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| to finalize the stakeholder engagement surveys that will be distributed to students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| family, staff, community members, and representatives on September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| And also, board members, earlier this year as a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| we had expressed our desire to use outside vendors for the community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5643)|
| 1:34:10| and the strategic planning pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| So just to note that the contract resulting from the RFP for strategic planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| is on our August 8th meeting agenda for your consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| and, of course, we can discuss that more tonight when we get to that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| Great. Thank you, Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| We will now move into our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| Yeah, does anybody need a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Y'all want a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Why don't we do a five-minute break for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| and then we'll meet back in here at, well, how about 640?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| Ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| Oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| I mean, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| I forgot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| Library update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Yeah, and then we'll have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Yeah, 640 is in two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| Yes, so while the library policy discussions and changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| probably seems very top of mind, and we've been talking about it all summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| our librarians returned last week on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| and for many of them that was kind of their first return back to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| On Friday they were in service with our library supervisor, Ms. Searles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| and I actually went out and joined that conversation on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| So that was their first time together as a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| and quite honestly for a lot of them the first time they got an update on the full breadth of the law change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| around the Age-Appropriate Materials Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| and some of our changed policies and procedures that we've worked through over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| So Sarah and her team met with that group on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| and discussed the changes in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| implications in terms of our own policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| and things that that was going to mean for them in terms of their library collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| and just really workflow in general in their libraries as they're opening school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| and thinking about running their libraries as they would in any other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| So that was kind of their first touch point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| and during the in-service they spent time actually with text that they brought as examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| learning kind of a process of going through and reviewing their text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| and Sarah and her team helped them with practicing and collaborating around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| taking the new requirements in the law and starting to vet through some titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| and look for examples of compliance and non-compliance in the titles that they were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| As a walk away, again, and I'll lean back into something that Dr. Eiswick mentioned earlier on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| in this discussion around policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| is that we are not going to be able to start the year 100% in compliance with the new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| We can begin the process of building out our procedures and our steps to move towards compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| and that's really where we left off with librarians on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| was to begin a process of them going back and to start reviewing the titles in their collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| and start doing some cataloging and identifying of books that may not be in compliance with the new law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| and from that point they're going to work in concert with the library team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| to begin to take those individual lists that they're going to begin to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| and then have a consolidation process kind of each quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| to bring those titles back for some collective voice to think through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| which titles we're seeing as being non-compliant that would potentially need to be removed from the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| because we want to make those decisions with consistency across the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| and not have individual librarians responsible for making decisions about titles by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5859)|
| 1:37:46| So that's where we left off for the beginning of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| and would expect a quarterly sort of check-in with the library departments to help them consolidate those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| Awesome. Any questions? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| Okay, a few people have requested a break, so let's take a 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| 6.50, not 6.40. We'll be back here at 6.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| Regular session agenda. Do we have any questions or comments on 6C, 1, 2, or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5890)|
| 1:38:22| 4 or 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5902)|
| 1:38:31| 6 or 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| 8 or 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| 10 or 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| 13, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Okay, or 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| This is approving a memorandum of understanding with Teach for America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| I would really like to see us not have anything to do with Teach for America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| This is seriously concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| This is something that I know our board has worked for a long time to be sure that we were not involved with Teach for America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5953)|
| 1:39:22| So I'd really like to see this reconsidered. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| 15 or 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| 17 or 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| 19 or 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| And we'll see 21 has been withdrawn. It wasn't quite ready for the agenda, so that item has been taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5989)|
| 1:39:59| 22 or 23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Thank you, Madam Chair. Can somebody talk to us about why there's transcript services for Farragut? Is that different than other schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6004)|
| 1:40:15| Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| Yeah, my understanding of the transcript service is it's just a service they buy into so that when people are looking for proof of high school graduation or records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6016)|
| 1:40:25| that it kind of centralizes those requests and service provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6025)|
| 1:40:31| Okay, but it's only for Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| This request is for Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| 24 or 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| 26 or 27?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| Moving on then to board policies. We don't have the entire alphabet tonight, so A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6055)|
| 1:41:03| That's a pleasant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| Moving on to grants. A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6067)|
| 1:41:15| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| E or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| Okay then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| Moving on to contracts. 9A, and this is the work that Dr. Brown did speak about earlier in the announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6087)|
| 1:41:39| B or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| D or E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| Or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| All right, moving on to regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| A has been withdrawn, so B or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| D, I know we did have discussion earlier on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6123)|
| 1:42:11| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Thank you, Madam Chair. I know we've had a differentiated pay plan for many, many years, for at least as long as I've been on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| but I'm curious if there's been any adjustments to the plan because of the most recent work that we've done around the salary schedule and all the adjustments that were made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6140)|
| 1:42:30| Ms. Mulgarn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, as a result of the salary schedule transition, there was not an adjustment to the differentiated pay plan because it's just our new salary schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6151)|
| 1:42:42| so this looks largely similar to what you all approved last year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| What you'll notice is missing from here is the staff referral bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| so if that pilot continues into something that we do year over year, that would be added in next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| Any questions or discussions on E or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6182)|
| 1:43:11| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6191)|
| 1:43:19| Sorry, I'm trying to look at which one of these is adding the step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6199)|
| 1:43:27| I want to be sure I understand that are we adding a step in addition to wherever they are now, or are we adding a step to wherever they were last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6207)|
| 1:43:41| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, adding a step to their placement, the placement they received a salary notification for on the new scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| Okay, so if they've gone through the Google form and they've been changed, it's still an additional step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6229)|
| 1:43:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Is that going to be an issue when we have new employees who are coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6239)|
| 1:44:08| It makes me wonder if we have someone who is at step seven and they've been teaching or working six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6248)|
| 1:44:17| and then we have someone new come in and they haven't had that bump, then it's going to be a disparity between their pay and their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6257)|
| 1:44:28| That's a good point, and we should have added the caveat that employees that were with us for the 23-24 school year, it's a plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6268)|
| 1:44:36| The employees that are new to the district that we've hired since July 1, that have just started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| that are not transitioning from the old scale to the new scale, they would be placed according to the experience that they bring into the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6282)|
| 1:44:51| This is granting the plus one on the new general scale for employees that transitioned from the old scales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6291)|
| 1:45:00| because the general scale employees were not granted a plus one when they came over as the certified one and certified two scales were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6300)|
| 1:45:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| All right, moving on to public forum. I don't think we have anyone signed up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| All right, moving on to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| Sophia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| I just want to say good luck to all the freshmen tomorrow, and if there's anything I could tell you being a senior right now is get involved in your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6327)|
| 1:45:36| I wouldn't say get as involved as I am because I have like ten clubs I'm doing, but definitely get involved because you're going to blink and you're going to be a senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| So definitely have fun while you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| I wanted to bring up something I already discussed with Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| Adrian Burnett is flooding right now. Well, it was flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| One of the wings got flooded because the roof wasn't sealed properly, and there were multiple teachers that contacted me about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6355)|
| 1:46:02| So that's all. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| I did want to, Madam Chair, I did want to respond to Sophia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| So Mr. Triplett checked with the principal about that, and it was a roof leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| She confirmed it was not a flood issue, but we are going to look into that with the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm excited about the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| District 1 has several new executive principals and teams that are going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| So we're excited for them and praying and encouraging community and families and students to be excited as well as staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6395)|
| 1:46:47| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| So I know there's no board forum on the agenda, which is typical for the regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| and so I think this is my last opportunity to publicly state how much I've appreciated serving over the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6416)|
| 1:47:03| I certainly have learned a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| I think it grew me more than I grew the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| So I love the way things are getting left, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| I'm really excited for the future and still have very much vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Sophia, you're speaking to my son. He's going to be a freshman at West this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| So very much vested in the work that's continuing to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| So it's an honor to work with each of you, and you all have stretched me in a lot of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| and hopefully I've been able to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| I just would like to thank Ms. Horne, even though she's not here, and Ms. Owen, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| Appreciate their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| And I also want to recognize Dr. Wilson for wearing a tie and trying to dress up as good as Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| I think that's an impressive move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Looking sharp today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| I'm very impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| You look better than the superintendent and a couple other guys down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| It looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240805?start=6477)|
