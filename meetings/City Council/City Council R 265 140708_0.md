| 0:03:17| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| For the Mayor's Report, I'll start off by just reflecting back on the Fourth of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| our festival on the Fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| It was one of the most successful ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| I don't know how many of you were there as a big crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| I was there and thoroughly enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| The weather couldn't have been better, and the music was wonderful, the symphony was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| wonderful, and of course the fireworks were great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| So I want to give a special thanks to our Special Events Department, along with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| the other departments, Police, Fire, Public Service, PBA, all the folks who were, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| know, Park Patrol, all the folks who were down there who really made this so successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| And they all had to work, by the way, while we were enjoying the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| Tomorrow at 10.30 a.m., there will be a groundbreaking ceremony for the Marble Alley Lofts Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| on State Street downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| It's tomorrow at 10.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Mayor Birch's office is coordinating this event, you know, it's county-owned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| that was sold to the developers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| And as you all know, this is a new residential development on property that had been owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| So the city is supporting the development with major improvements and investments in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| the streetscapes all around the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Council has approved that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| And this is really the first new residential construction that we have seen downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| We've seen a lot of repurposing of the older buildings, but this is the first new residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| construction since the resurgence of downtown more than a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| It might even be more exciting than a jail, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| I think it's going to be a lot more exciting than a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| It will bring more than 200 apartments and hundreds of residents to land that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| sitting vacant for years and, as was mentioned, was going to be a jail at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| And it will really help connect Market Square and Gay Street to the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| And actually, I drove by there today and they're already moving the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| So we're going to just join with Mayor Birch to do the ceremonial groundbreaking, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| ground has broken and they're moving fast and furious on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| So we congratulate the developers on that and look forward to having that new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| So again, that's tomorrow at 1030 for the groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| Some more good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| On Thursday, July 10th at 6 p.m., I invite you all to join me and Chief Roush to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| Civic Auditorium for the graduation of our newest class of Police Department recruits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| The last class was in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| We were talking about that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| It was one of my first official duties, I think, as mayor, was to be at that last recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| class graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| We have 31 graduates and I know the chief and all the rest of our force is looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| to them joining the force and being out there protecting us and doing what y'all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| There are, so that's tomorrow, I mean Thursday, July 10th at 6 p.m. at the Civic Auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=376)|

| 0:06:47| Our Office of Sustainability has been working on some changes to the city ordinances, working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| with the law department and maybe others, I'm not sure, but to make it easier for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| to operate community gardens in the city and also for people who operate small gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| to be able to sell their own produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| So this meeting will be a chance to learn more about these proposals and more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=424)|

| 0:14:51| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| This resolution is something that came to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| There are many pet owners downtown now, and there's interest in having some types of dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=897)|

| 0:15:14| be able to exist, and so in discussion with MPC, we're merely asking them to study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=914)|
| 0:15:22| and then report back to us, and I don't know if Mark Donaldson, did you have anything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| add on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| No, thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| I think you described the situation very accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| We are getting requests for these types of businesses in areas that currently don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| provisions to allow them, so we want to take a look at what other communities are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| and take a look at our current code and see how we can amend it if necessary or add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=949)|

| 0:17:20| So we just wanted to underline the importance that the continuation of the First Creek Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| would have to these neighborhoods, and of course, the ultimate vision, which the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| already has plans, is to connect Fountain City all the way through our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| and down to the Central District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| So we would ask that this be supported, and, you know, the cost expenditure, which we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1059)|
| 0:17:47| look at, but I think it's de minimis, as we say sometimes, as far as what we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| obtaining with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1072)|

| 0:18:16| in the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1096)|

| 0:18:34| so this is top priority for us, so probably within the next couple of meetings, I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| to clean the last ones up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1119)|

| 0:20:49| This is, I might point out that there was a lot of discussion last meeting about change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| orders and this is kind of different in one way because it's not a professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| contract, it's a purchase of stuff, and in this case it's miles of stripe on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1264)|
| 0:21:13| so it gets bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| We got a really good bid and we need a lot of stripe, so we just, this change order is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1277)|
| 0:21:26| to spend the rest of the money that we had because we got a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| And we have needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Yeah, so this is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| We're going to be able to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| We had the money budgeted and we're going to be able to do more than we had originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| anticipated we could with it, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1308)|

| 0:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| I think Don Michelle is here or maybe Bob is interested in looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| I just wanted to point out that the added price took my breath away a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| We had a $600,000 contract with Hargreaves to do the big picture from 60,000 feet or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| something and then we had the $667,000 contract in December of 2012 to get this design work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| and I know there have been standard changes, resubmissions of permits, utility work and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| other things, but we got a $313,000 increase, so tell us a little bit about it because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| spending real dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| He said yeah, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| Yes, we had an original contract for $600,000 to do a constructability review on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| Three or four big items here I'd just like to lay on the table before we get into any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| of the details on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| First of all, we picked up a project that was designed six years ago and then put on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| a shelf to do a constructability review, so that's quite a challenge when you do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| to pick one of those things up and go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| Secondly, as you move forward in this project, we have to prepare not just for our roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| and not just for our park, but we have to prepare for private development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| You'll notice there's a lot of KUBs in this one that were involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| Three, we're working on a brownfield site that also has a lot of cultural resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| and you'll notice there under the construction we have to have a lot of supervision on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| site while it's going forward to make sure we get that done properly and within the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| And then fourthly, we're working next to the river, so TVA's involved and when we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| in to talk with them about this a year ago, they said, by the way, we still think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| a good project, but you've got to get everything re-permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| So we're on a brownfield, we're next to the river, we have cultural resources and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| preparing for private development, so we've got a lot of complexity and issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| If you'll notice the way it breaks down, we've got $114,000 for design services, $80,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| of that is because of design that were involved in the KUB and preparing for the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| We've got $50,000 in new permitting fees, fees to get our permits in place, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| there's another $140,000 basically to build on top of a brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| So all these things came about after we picked up these plans and did this review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| We have the consultants here tonight if you have any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Don Michelle's here if you need to ask any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| This has been a hard one to get off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| It did get designed a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| We've got it ready and we're ready to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| I was picturing two or three guys with stakes and some orange paint and you lay it out and you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| There's a place for that in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| It's just like two guys in the truck and the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| It didn't really work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| I gave you three guys on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| 11G is a resolution authorizing the acceptance and expressing appreciation to the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Firefighters Association for the donation of $13,853.80 to be used for the purchase of supplies for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| Knoxville Fire Department's Learn Not to Burn program in order to educate children about fire safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Mr. Kevin Faddis is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| I'd like him to come to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1528)|
| 0:25:38| Would you like to give a little update on this, Kevin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| I'm the Firefighter Association President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| This is something, if you guys remember last year, I believe it was, and previous years, this is something that's very near and dear to our hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| As a community, as the Firefighters Association, this is something that we have committed to, to help the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1554)|
| 0:26:05| As Chief Sharp can attest, and maybe some of you all on the panel, when your children or your grandchildren, nieces, nephews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1565)|
| 0:26:14| you can always tell when it's fire safety week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| First thing they want you to do is press the smoke detector button, which I certainly encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| All of you all need to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| But it's something that helps the community and it makes us feel good and it certainly educates the children because they're very impressionable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1585)|
| 0:26:33| at that age and they seem to retain a lot of that knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| So we're committed to this and we're hoping in the future, for many years to come, that we'll be able to do this and you all can accept this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| We appreciate very much from the Firefighters Association all the work that you do, the money you've raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| I just want you to know we recognize and we thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Well, thank you all for having me out here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I want to know, do we still teach kids to stop, drop, and roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| I remember when my kids came home from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| And cover your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| There's a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| You've got to cover your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| I didn't know that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| But I can remember it and it's stuck with me ever since I heard them say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| It's that type of stuff, that kind of education at a young age that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| You teach the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Kevin, you have a question for Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Do you all mainly teach this at the community centers or the Boys and Girls Clubs or in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| Or where do you mainly teach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Vice Mayor, we go to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| We do go to community centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Sometimes children come out to the fire stations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| It's very on a little field trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| But anywhere, you know, it's one of our captains, Paul Trompore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| they can set that up through the education department with the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| They can call the admin office and set all that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| And we'll be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Somebody will come out there and teach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| It's a very good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1688)|

| 0:28:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1719)|

| 0:28:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 17, Article 2, Division 3, Section 17-71| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| by adding a new subsection imposing an electric citation fee of $5 upon a plea of guilty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| or nullo contendere or a judgment of guilty for violation of certain traffic ordinances of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Well, since we've waited for the Chief to come back so he can tell us about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I wonder if you'd tell us a little bit about this and what you're going to try to use the money for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| in terms of improving enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| So what this does, Councilman, is it will provide us an opportunity to move into this century with technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| So currently officers handwrite all citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| and it goes through a laborious process to getting to the court in terms of paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| This will make it instantaneous, and so it will immediately go into our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| improves the efficiency for not only the officer but also our citizens who choose to violate the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1797)|
| 0:30:05| And then as well, it enhances the safety for our law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| There's a study that was just released this week based on the FBI national numbers on officers killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| and injured in the line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Number two cause is traffic collision or traffic stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| So while they're on stops, officers get injured and killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Just from passing cars, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Passing cars, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| And so this will enhance and increase our safety by reducing the time on a traffic stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| Speeds up the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Speeds up process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| There's a statement in there that the estimated period of this will be, we'll do it for five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| and then we'll stop doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| I have heard government say that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Is there really a sunset provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| There is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| State law has put a sunset of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| That's good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| You fund it and then you don't say, oh, we have another need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Chief, in the information we got previously, there was a breakdown of how that $5 was going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| $1 is going to go to the court or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Kind of explain that, how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| So what will happen is $4 will go to the law enforcement agency, Knoxville Police Department will get $4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| It will go to strictly for e-citation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| And $1 goes to the court strictly for a support program that they'll have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| They'll have to have the hardware and software as well in the court side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| So that's what it pays for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| So it pays for software for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| For the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| I didn't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| So he writes the ticket and it goes straight over to the court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1903)|

| 0:31:46| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| And recruits aren't required to have legible writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Worse than doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140708?start=1916)|
