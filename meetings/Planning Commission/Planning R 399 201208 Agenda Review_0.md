| 0:02:37| I think we all would like to meet in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| but given the state of situation we have with the COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| The county commission likewise is now going virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| Instead of having an in-person meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| But anyway, before we get started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and hope everyone had a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=178)|

| 0:03:27| As you all are aware, as we just discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| Governor Lee's extended the virtual meeting options at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| And I anticipate that that'll be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Into the new year, but we'll keep you posted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| I do want to say a few words about our public counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| As you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| we are a public county department we are, we do remain open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Both in person and online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| We are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| as we have been since March encouraging people to submit electronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| whenever possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| but our public counter remains staffed and open as does the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| And the city County building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| We have reduced the number of our staff on site over the last couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| And we will continue to reassess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Our operations plan after the first of the year and keep you all as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| as the public updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| On the status of folks here in the office and any changes that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| that might might take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| There have been a few recent opportunities for continuing education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| If you have missed those opportunities, you can still take advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| them. I sent you all a link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| With links to the recordings of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| And I anticipate these will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| these will remain available for a number of months to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| So just let us know if you get a chance to review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=278)|

| 0:04:46| Copying Dory is always helpful, but it's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| She's the one who keeps track of your hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| I also welcome ideas and input on future agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=291)|

| 0:04:57| I know that our agendas have been really packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| So we've been somewhat hesitant to add too much more to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| In the interest of time and allowing you all to focus on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| I'm at hand, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| there might be opportunity over the next few months to, to add a topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| And if there's something that you want to discuss, please reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| And we will try to find the appropriate speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Who can address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| So our staff is continuing to strive to make it easier for community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| members to sign up, to speak at planning commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| as well as submit comments to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| You all as commissioners and, and as well as contact staff with questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| We are very aware of the volume of emails that you all receive on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| And our staff has been working hard to find ways to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| for these comments to be shared with you in an easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| Format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| And an easier way also to reference them via our website and also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| cleaner way for those to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| For those cases that go forward to city council and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| And in a way that's easier for those bodies to digest and read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| comments. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Allie catch on our communication outreach coordinator is going to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| you through some of these new tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| So I'm going to turn it over to her for a few minutes. If Allie is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Hey, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| I don't see you all often. So it's nice to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| Let me turn on my screen share and make sure you guys can see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| All right. Can you all see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| Yes, we can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| All right. So I sent you all an email on Friday and I just want to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| up and show this to you. I would say in person, but virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| Just there are some of you who have been checking comments the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| for years and years at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| So I know anytime there's a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| sometimes it's easier to just see it kind of in person and having to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| through instructions on an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| But like Amy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| we're trying to find ways to improve some of our processes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| interacting with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| And one of those is a new public comment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| That's really intended for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| So there are a couple of different ways that you can access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| And I just wanted to walk you through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| The easiest way to access it is to just go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| knox.org slash comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| And I linked to that in the email lesson on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| But this is really the easiest way to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| You just put that URL in and the comments come up on this page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| And from this page, you can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| use a couple of different filters and sort things a couple of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| So to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| if you want to pick your meeting that you're trying to see the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| for, you can do it in that field right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| You can also choose a case this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| But if you want to see all the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| you can just kind of scroll down through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I'll also point out that we have added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| The ability to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| Attachments to the comments that people are submitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| And so if there is an attachment on any of the comments, you'll see this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| this green button and you can click on that and it'll show you whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| that attachment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| In addition to being able to sort things the way I just showed you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| here at the top of these dropdown menus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| You can also go in and you can sort things by date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| So if it's like the day of the meeting and you haven't checked comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| you know, since the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| you can go in and click on the date and it will sort everything either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| you know, oldest to newest or newest oldest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| So you can go in and you'll see the date and the timestamp on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| And that way you can make sure that you've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| you've been able to review all those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| Another useful tool for you all, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| is being able to sort by case number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| So if you click on that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| it'll sort it either by the last numerical or, or, or first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| And that might be useful, like as you're in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| if you're trying to refer back to some public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| I want to make sure that you're seeing everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| You can do it that way pretty easily as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| So in addition to just going straight to this URL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| if you go to our website and go to the words and committees page to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:38| planning commission page on the meeting updates portion of that page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| you'll be able to find public comments right here in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| And you can choose a specific case from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| And if you click on that, it'll just bring it up for that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| And then, you know, you can also access all the comments this way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| You can just clear out these filters and it'll show you all the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| And then in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| you can also access comments on the commission page from the cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| info webpage. So from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| every case that's listed will have a purple public comment button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| You can click on that and it pops up any comments related to that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| And the same is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| If you click on this case and go in to see like the full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| the full case that has everything associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| that public comment button is still there and it's still just shows you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| for that one specific case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| So just a reminder that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| you're not going to be receiving every single email through the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| email address anymore, but hopefully this really makes it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| And like Amy said, cleaner for you all and a little more manageable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| especially on months that you get just an abundance of correspondence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| So I don't know if anybody has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| but I would be happy to try to answer them if so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| I know this has been working really well for our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| but we want to make sure it's working well for you all too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Allie, this is Karen. I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| You indicated that we won't be getting every single one of the messages in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| our email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| At what point did that start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| Because I I've been using my email as like, it's easy to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| like this one came in and I've read it. I've read it. I've read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| So when did that start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| So we started using this form actually at some point in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| And I think that staff have continued to push forward some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| emails. So this is a little bit of a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| You probably are still have still received a few emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| but what we're trying to do is really make that shift clean and do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| that they're like every single comment is on the website, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| I know that that might be a little messy for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| And I apologize for that, that we're trying to get everybody on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| Sure. So just to clarify, definitely from today, moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| we should not rely on our email to be the place where we can see all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| We should be going here to make sure that we've read all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| Correct. And our like web developer guru guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Josh Anderson on staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| he has been sort of working through some of those processes and has created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| some like functions so that emails that are coming in are going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| getting like automatically filtered into the form. So it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| it's hopefully moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| This won't even be an issue with any staff boarding stuff on and it'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| all be exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Thank you. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| And Allie, my understanding, I spoke to Josh before the, before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| and that's, that's happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Cause I had those similar questions cause I was comparing what had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| coming in, in the email versus what's on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| So he said that that's already in place. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| I had a quick question, but I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| I couldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| when in the very beginning when you were showing the filters of date and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| case, and then you say, you can just clear them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| How did you find those filters? Oh, sure. Here, let me go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| So if you want to pick a meeting that it's specifically for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| there's a dropdown box up at the top. Do you see those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| So if you want to pick this month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| you can go straight to that one. If you want to clear it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| you can hit this X by date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| You can also sort these choices at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| You can sort by any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| I don't know that name or comment would really be useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| but you can sort them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| I think if you sort by comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| it's going to start with like any comment that starts with X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| And name would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| if people are commenting on multiple cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| And then there's also date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| So if you click on that, that's like a live button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| And it sorts it by date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Do you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| No, I can't see where you saw date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| There's definitely not a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| No, I can't see where you saw date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Does it show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| It showed up automatically the one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| How did you find, was it under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Where did you find the date dropdown? I'm sorry, but I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Oh, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| For the meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Is that what you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Yeah. So there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Day, but you to determine which are the most recent comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| You had time and day in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| You had two yellow boxes on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| To those yellow boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| If you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Choose a meeting. It's going to show up as a yellow box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| If you choose a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| It's going to show up here as a yellow box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| But then if you are just sorting by the time and date that a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| And you click this, it's not going to show you a yellow box up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| top. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| The yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| My question was to keep track of the most recent ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| And I, I guess, assume they'd be chronological,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| but you don't want to have to go back and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Figure that out for each case necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:39| Teal box at the top here that shows case number, name, comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| and date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| If you click on that, where it says date there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| it's going to sort it by date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| And it'll also show you by time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| And so that is how I would recommend making sure, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| if you're just trying to make sure you've got the most recent comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| since the last time you viewed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| you can click on that button and it's going to sort them that way for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| So you can make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| I know we all really appreciate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| but I have struggled so much with the emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Trying to read each one and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Trying to remember which went to what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| This is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| From my point of view. Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Great. We're very happy to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| And I do want to actually point out one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| So if there is a case that has been on multiple agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| And you want to see all the comments associated with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| This case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| We'll show you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| So there are comments that go all the way back to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| October, maybe for this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| So just an additional sort of function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| If there's a case that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| come back around or been postponed or whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| and you want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Comments that were initially made the first time it ever came on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| That's a way to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Just want to make sure you guys do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| I have one quick follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Oh, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| I still muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Before I became a planning commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| there was some confusion on the public side about whether comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| were submitted at the planning commission hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| We're automatically forwarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| To the elective body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| County or city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| And I'm still confused about whether that occurs or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| So all comments that are submitted for a case that goes on to either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| county commission or city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Become part of the permanent record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| And so those do those do go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| There are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| For review by those bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| Gail and I've had our hand raised a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| We've had our hand up forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| So anyways, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Hello, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| I think this is a great initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| I personally thank you so much because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| I am constantly having to clean out my emails because I get so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| commission emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| So I think this is a great initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| I will look forward to the day that we no longer get an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| Because this is just so much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| To maneuver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| And look at all the cases instead of having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| 150 emails each month and trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Like Sandra said, keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| I really appreciate it, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I'm sure your leadership was instrumental in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| And I want to say thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| We appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| And we're glad to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| And I will say that the credit goes to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| And the city of San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| And the city of Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| And the city of Santa Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| And the city of Phoenix and the city of Arkansas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| And the city of San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Yeah, we're glad to hear that and I will say that the credit goes to Amy and Dory and Lauren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| Josh Anderson for putting their heads together and figuring out ways to make this easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| on everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Um, I guess, um, what I was curious about, is there a way, you know, it's really disadvantageous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| to people who are in opposition or proponents of an issue when we can't see their face on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| the, on this screen and, um, is there, have we made any progress towards allowing, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| people that are going to speak on or against items where they could be seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| Communication, visual communication is, is being missed and a lot of people, uh, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| would be better served if we could get them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Any progress there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Um, that is a, a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| Um, we have not taken that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| So it's, I won't get into the details of Zoom, but it's how we, um, we, we have to elevate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| them up to panelists in order to, um, do some of those things, but so if that is the preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| of the commission to have people be able to turn on their video and see their face, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| we can, we can move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Is that something that this body would like to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| I would just say that if we are going to move forward, you know, much longer with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| format, it would be something we probably should talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Yeah, I, I agree with Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Um, I don't, what's the downside, Amy, in terms of staffing abilities or time, is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:46| more difficult to have their video shown or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| It's just a little more hands-on in terms of us, you know, moving people around and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| making sure that the appropriate people, um, you know, are, are presenting at the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Um, I think it's, it's, it's feasible that we can work that out, especially given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| longevity of this, um, pandemic and the idea that, that we might have to continue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| virtual meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| So we do want to make it as easy as possible and as fair, um, for people to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| as they, as we can in this format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I met them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| That would be my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| And if there's any objection from other commissioners, please raise it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| But I think, um, Commissioner Smith brought up a good, good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| I'm all in favor of being able to see, see the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| This is necessarily something that needs to be voted on unless there is a difference of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| opinion in terms that we can all discuss it with staff and we can proceed accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Does that sound okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Thanks, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Thank you, Allie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| And really, um, Allie played a key role, even though she just said that she didn't, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| also Josh Anderson and she mentioned Dory and Laura have put a lot of effort into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| And over the next few months, test it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I know this is new for all of you in terms of, um, how you have been receiving comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| especially those of you who've been on the commission a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| So please provide us feedback on ways that we can improve new, any kind of new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| It looks shiny new right now, but obviously there's always opportunity for improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| and our staff is open to suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Thank you, Allie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Just let us know if you have any feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| So that, I didn't have any additional, um, comments to share with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Is there anything, any other questions that any of the commissioners have before we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| into the agenda, review agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Let's see, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| So we'll move on to resignings and plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| The first item is item number nine, um, Patricia Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| This applicant is requesting a rezoning and plan amendment from low density and agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| to general commercial and general business and staff is recommending denial as Albertson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| will review the case with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| I'm going to share my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Can you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| So I'm not going to spend a lot of time with this first one because we've actually already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1408)|
| 0:23:38| reviewed it and we have quite a few things and, um, issues we need to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| This is Patricia Nelson's, um, rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| This is off of Osborne road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Um, this is up near the strawberry planes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| I 40 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| She is requesting to go to, um, general commercial, um, and she would also like, uh, CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:24:09| Um, we are recommending denial of this because it is not consistent with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| development or zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Um, it's, you know, pretty far away from the interstate node here, um, and not in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:25| with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| So we are recommending denial on that, uh, commercial use in the middle of these single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| family residential and rural residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| Does anyone have any questions about that before I go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Trying to see if I see any hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| I don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I'm going to keep going then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Um, this is the one we have been receiving a lot of comments on, um, this is in the Northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:24:59| city sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Um, this is off of Walker Springs lane, um, and the applicant here is sorry, requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:12| to go to from OP, um, which is the office park zone district for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| Um, the applicant is actually requesting our N6, um, which is a recommended zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1518)|
| 0:25:27| in the medium density residential office designation for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| However, um, we feel that that is a little bit of an intense, um, ask for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| particularly because it is adjacent to this single family residential district, the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| height limitation and our N6 is 60 feet, um, versus our N5, which is 35 feet, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1545)|
| 0:25:57| which is the same building height, uh, limitation as the adjacent load entity residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Um, we've received a lot of comments about the greenway, um, that runs through this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| Um, you know, it is, um, I believe one of the sort of, um, selling points for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:23| having a multifamily at this location is that they would have access to a greenway, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| that connects over to, um, the larger park off of North Winston road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| There's also some medium density residential existing in the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| This is adjacent to the I-40 corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| So staff is recommending our N5 again, um, because the building height limitation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| So that's more compatible with the adjacent single family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| Um, we did make a small revision that you should have received in your packet, um, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| for the blue sheets today, uh, related to the transportation impact study that was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| on, um, or that was dated November 17th by Fulgham McAdoe, um, they are recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| a new traffic signal at the existing intersection of North Gullah Harvey road and East Walker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Um, they've noted that on page three, I've included a few portions of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1648)|
| 0:27:37| impact study with, um, the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| So you have some idea of what they're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Um, there are some additional appendices that go along with that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| If you would like to see those, we can email those out to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| Um, the, obviously the city of Knoxville's, um, traffic office will have to further evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| any recommendations that are made by the traffic impact study, um, and that will, uh, manifest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1679)|
| 0:28:10| as they come through with their design review for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Um, a couple of things I wanted to sort of highlight, um, cause I think there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| comments about, um, you know, whether or not this type of use is appropriate in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:29| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| And I will refer back to the sector plan designation and note that, um, with a medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| and office designation, you know, it's ideally located near community activity centers, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| including schools, parks, um, and community commercial and office nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| Um, this rezoning, I would say meets that criteria, uh, it is also in a transitional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| area between the right away of the interstate 40 and the low density residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| Um, and again, it is in an area that is served by transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| I have included a map, um, that shows transit in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| You can, um, see that in green, these are the cat bus routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| Um, so there is a transit location, um, servicing this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| There is also a greenway, um, that runs through the area and sidewalks actually exist, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| in and around, I think some of the adjacent neighborhoods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I believe there's also a bike lane, which is what this small green, um, line is along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| North Winston Road, uh, if you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Sorry, here is, this is also in your, um, packet, uh, so you can see what each of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| line colors means related to the transportation network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| Um, so as far as landscaping goes, I believe we've had some concerns and questions related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:30:05| to landscaping, um, in between this development and, uh, the adjacent single family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| neighborhood as well as around the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| And I just wanted to remind the commission that there is a landscape ordinance, um, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| is part of the zoning ordinance and it calls out specific landscaping requirements related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| particularly to multifamily dwelling, um, in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| There's also, uh, sorry, a tree protection ordinance, um, oops, uh, that the city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| in place, um, and again, they will have to submit a landscape plan, um, that must be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:52| uh, permitted prior to issuance of, uh, building permits if this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| So, uh, I'm sure I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| That's all I have for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Commissioner Scott-Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Um, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I was going to ask, it's currently zoned, um, OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| What is the building height, uh, gu- uh, parameters for OP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| So I believe OP is, I believe it's up to 60 feet, um, but I will say OP does not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| consideration of multifamily at this location, um, but let me toggle over to OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:37| And the reason I mentioned that, it's just, it seems to me like an office park, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| tall buildings, um, is very similar to kind of an apartment development in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1903)|
| 0:31:52| I guess it's, uh, impact in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| And since it's, I don't know, to me, I was just curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| currently if it allows that height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Yeah, and I will say that in the MDRO designation, it says exactly that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| the office and medium density residential uses typically have similar development characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| related to scale of buildings and areas devoted to parking and yard spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| uh, in their general location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Okay, that was my only question, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Thanks, um, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| First, just confirmation that the Greenway is not going to be lost to, uh, folks with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1951)|
| 0:32:41| potential rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| It's always accessible to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| There seem to be messages coming in saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| there seem to be messages coming in saying they didn't want to lose the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| So just confirming, Greenway's not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| No, it is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| And we asked, um, Tim Hester, who is the Greenway's coordinator for the city, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| you know, to weigh in with any additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| I, I think he's still on, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| But there, it is a, from my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| Go ahead, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| I'm back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| I lost you there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| This is Tim Hester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| This Greenway is supported with a permanent easement that was obtained by the city in 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| It's a 20-foot wide easement, including the 10-foot wide Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| There would be the city's expectation that we would maintain this Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| at its current location, regardless of how the property was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| Great, thank you for confirming that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| The other questions I have about, are about the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| And, um, Liz, you indicated that there is a tree plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| And I, I saw the, the landscape buffer requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| But it seems like there's concern regarding the noise pollution that would be, uh, opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| if the current, uh, tree area is, is just taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| And it seems to be that that's what developers tend to do, is to completely denude the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| and then rebuild it and put in landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| That's not an adequate sound buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| So, can you talk more about the tree plan and how that might preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| some of the existing trees that are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2083)|
| 0:34:43| I, um, actually will, um, maybe ask Curtis Williams or someone from the city to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2083)|
| 0:34:52| speak a little bit about the tree protection ordinance that the city has in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| If Curtis is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| In, regarding the tree protection ordinance, um, that ordinance does apply kind of city-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| It's not really related to zoning or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| General, I'll give you the general gist of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| The, the purpose of the ordinance is to maintain six trees per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| And a tree has a certain definition in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| Or if you can't maintain six trees per acre, you're required to plant back at eight trees per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| And again, there are certain definitions of trees that, that are required for planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| I believe at least half of them, when you're replanting, have to reach a maturity height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| of 50 feet or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| So, um, it can't be all ornamental trees or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| We typically work pretty closely with, um, Casey Krause, the city's urban forester, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| when looking at projects and trying to make sure that if there are questions about compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| with the tree protection ordinance that he's involved, uh, just to make sure that we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| exactly what's required, uh, when, when certain things are not as clear cut, uh, no pun intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| Um, but just, uh, when it's not as, uh, obvious as it maybe shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| I also, sorry, wanted to mention that the applicant, I believe has sent in, um, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| applicant's representation, Taylor Forrester, I believe sent in an email today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Um, it looks like they have retained, uh, acoustic consultants to provide some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:43| of, uh, initial acoustic assessment, um, of the impact of the interstate related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| single family residential neighborhood and this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| Um, I haven't had an opportunity to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| I just received it before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Um, but I know that there is additional information, um, in there related exactly to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:07| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2229)|
| 0:37:09| I hadn't seen that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| And I'll just add real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| So in the zoning ordinance, there is an article 12, which is a landscape section of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| 12.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| There is, um, a section called tree preservation, and it does encourage the preservation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| existing trees and allows developers to use, um, those as a credit towards their landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Um, so I just wanted to give that as additional information in terms of, of that potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| for additional tree preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Um, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| It doesn't encourage you, but it doesn't require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Um, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| No, it gives you a credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| It doesn't require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| And I think in most cases, most developers find it much easier just as Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| says, denude the area, come back, throw some trees in and call it the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| And I wish there was a way that we could change those habits because it's really destructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:09| Thank you for clarifying that, uh, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| That's what I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:14| So Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| I have a question about the greenway going back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:19| I think you said there was a 20 foot easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| And so that's just five feet beyond the pavement on each side of the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| Are there any additional buffer requirements for the greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| There are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| Commissioner Korbelik, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| There's no additional requirements for the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| Um, I, uh, I'm not, I missed my space bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| So I agree with Commissioner, um, Smith, Scott Smith, that I think the impact that we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| at is primarily that just the relationship between, uh, developing the land, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| office or multifamily and the greenway and the residences to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2361)|
| 0:39:29| And I was, I had a couple of questions, but my primary question is, is it possible or appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| that the applicant could come back and request a PR on something like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| Because then we would have more latitude in working between the developer and the residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| in, uh, providing some additional buffer and responding to the concerns of both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| the applicant and the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Would this be an appropriate for PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Uh, I know he's not asking for that, but is that something that would be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| Well, sorry, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:11| Well, I was, this is Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Um, I was just going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| And, um, Liz, can you speak up a wee bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| I've got construction going on at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Yeah, that's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Um, so this is in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| So the city of Knoxville zoning ordinance is, are the zone districts that we are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| And PR is a county zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| So maybe we're thinking of planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Would this work for planned development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| Um, I think it might be hard, um, you know, to, uh, get that to sort of fit within planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| There has to be a, you know, community benefit generally, um, as a reason or rationale for why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| um, planned development is sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| But along with that, sorry to jump in, but wouldn't a benefit be something, or isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| there the potential for a benefit to be something associated with the greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Wouldn't that be a benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| The fact that they might provide some additional buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Perhaps you arrange the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| So it's pulled a little farther back, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| That would definitely be a public benefit, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Hey, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Why, why are we talking about a different zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| I mean, I think they, what they, the applicant has asked for an R that R in six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| And I just, in the efforts of like on Thursday, if we want to move through this thing quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| I don't understand why we would be talking about a development plan or another zone request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| when this is not what they've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Yeah, well, I was curious to see if there was a more appropriate zone out there than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| This is a bit of a complicated site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| And I just felt that all that we are able to do is to approve a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| And then anything can be done, whether he shows it to us or not as a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| anything can be done according to what the standards are for that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| So he's, the applicant is not committed to actually undertaking anything that is shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| Since those aren't conditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| I was just casting about for something that would allow the applicant to comfortably move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| forward while we're addressing some of the concerns of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And to be honest, the community at large, it uses that Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| The relationship between the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| The Greenway is not being, I mean, they're preserving the Greenway, are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| I mean, it's not being removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Well, they can't because it's an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| But if you look at when I looked at the site plan, I noticed that the landscaping along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| that side of the Greenway where the parking lot is, is rather slim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| And the lot itself looks like it's just a few feet from the Greenway trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| And I know the applicant has the right to do that under the RN six or five zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| But I do think that there's a community wide impact and conversely, a community wide benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| with another zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Commissioners appreciate all the good dialogue, but it's 1215 and we've got quite a few more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| items on the agenda to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| We do need to try to move this thing, try to complete it as close to 1 o'clock as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| because unlike me, there are people who do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Since I'm retired, I don't have to worry about it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| But let's take one more comment from Commissioner and then let's move on to number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| Yeah, I'm with Commissioner Smith a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| You know, I know who this developer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| And this developer actually built all the apartments on East Walker Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| He actually, I think he developed the subdivision and had intentions of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:55| Chris, we lost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| He's present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2696)|
| 0:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Hey Chris, you're muted or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| No, he's frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| Hey, Pat, this is Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| So I'm going to agree with Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| I mean, I think what's happening in our agenda review is we're doing too much debating if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| could just because like a lot of you all have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| If we could ask questions and let the staff have time to get back to us on Thursday, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| so we can move through this because I just I can't stay for three hours on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| And then, you know, six hours Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| So that's just my only recommendation is that we just kind of go through the agenda a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| bit faster, get questions and let staff have time to review and get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Have we lost Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| I guess we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| Real quick, Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| Hi, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Would this come back to us as a use on review or is this just like an allowed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| use under the zone and it's good to go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| It will not come back to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| All right, Amy, you want to move on to item number 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| Number 8, 11J20RZ, Acre Kingston Pike, T5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Michelle, do you want to give us a brief overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| So, well, this actually was postponed or it's going to be on your postponement list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| So I don't know if we want to just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Too much detail here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Yeah, I don't know that we need to give them too much detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| I had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Let's move on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Let's move on if it's delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| So we'll go on to 11, number 11, number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| Just real briefly and I'll turn it over to Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| So we will be asking Commission to amend the agenda to hear these two items together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| The first item that will need to be heard is a special use and it's the first request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| that the Commission has received to remove a previously approved planned district in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| So if you recall earlier this year, an amendment was made to the city code to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| property owners to request removal of a former planned district that may or may not have ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| come to fruition and allow for the underlying zone or new zoning requests to be made for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| I'll turn it over to Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Okay, so as Amy said, these are two requests sort of bounded together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| So I'll just kind of cover them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| This is for 2002 Thunderhead Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| It's part of that town center development off of I-640 and South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| I'm sure you're all familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| This is where the public sit or target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| This is Publix Elementary School along here in Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| So prior to the new zoning ordinance, this was zoned TC1, which was a planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Because there's no zoning equivalent to that in the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| it was rezoned to CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| This hatch just designates that there is an approved plan associated with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| planned district development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| It kind of acts like an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| And so looking into the zoning, the uses that are allowed in CG and CR are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:15| CG is actually a little bit less intense than CR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| So you're looking between general commercial and regional commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| So at that point, it kind of becomes a little bit more about the different standards within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:26| And in this case, which one is more similar, I guess, to the approved master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| And so in looking at the difference between these, for the development to meet or be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| consistent with the build out as is so far, CG would be the more appropriate zone because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| it's more aligned with the original master plan, medium density residential standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| And so with particular to the front setback and the master plan, there's a minimum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| five, a maximum of 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| If you look at the CR2 zone, it's 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| But if you go over to the CG3, it's 0 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| So it's more aligned that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| And the setbacks are kind of all that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| With regards to the lot standards, lot size and lot width, I don't think that in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| case it would be applicable because I believe that he wants to do apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| But even still, it's calling for smaller lots and higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| And looking at the sector plan and one-year plan designations, it's designated as mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| use community commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| So this particular designation does not list CR as one of the allowed zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| So currently, the existing zoning is not aligned with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| So rezoning it to CG would bring it into alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| And then looking at, well, I'll kind of go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| That's kind of it for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Now we'll kind of talk a little bit more about the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| And so I've taken a phone call from a concerned citizen saying that she had been talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| her neighbors and they all kind of felt the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| And then one person who sent an email, those comments were very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| And they were talking about the history of the development and what was approved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| original master plan as opposed to what's been approved since then and how it's deviated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| from the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| And so since that's become part of the conversation, I thought it would be beneficial for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| to kind of understand what's been happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| So as part of the original master plan that was approved in 2004, there were a core area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| and a peripheral area as part of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| The core area was mostly the commercial, did not allow residential uses on ground level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| but did allow them above commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| The peripheral area was mostly for residential and it caps that density at 16 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| And looking at the actual plan as it was approved, this is the area, this is the parcel here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| that wraps around the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| And it's all connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| The buildings are attached and there's a mixed use core along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| This pale beige area is the boardwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| And so there's also a green space and some greenway up along here that's been referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| by one of the people that I talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| And then in looking at the land use, this blue designation stands for mixed use residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| Again, the buildings are all shown as being attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| And then this yellow is mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| And then how the plan has changed since 2004, this is the single family residential, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| is pretty much in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| This is how these things have built out pretty close to how they've been built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| Again, this is still showing that as all connected buildings around the boardwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| In 2014, there were some changes to the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| This is the parcel here is shown divided into several different individual parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| The building was platted a few months later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Just this front parcel was carved off and built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| It's a bank now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| And this still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| This was the creation of the 2002 Thunderhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| And so, again, in thinking about whether or not to remove the planned district designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| from this property, if you're looking at some of the sector plan notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| Sorry, I've got lots of papers here to kind of cover all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| So, the mixed use community center designation allows for a variety of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| It calls for moderate intensity development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Multifamily residential developments are allowed within both the CG and the CR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| So, both the existing zone and the requested zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| They don't really have a density that's associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| So, the density would be determined by the buildable area, the height of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| and the size of the units that the developer is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| And looking at what was approved in the master plan, the core area had no density limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| The peripheral area capped it at 16, as we said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| The master plan also cited 2,000 square foot lots as the minimum lot size, which results on 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| So, still higher, even though it's capped at 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| So, one thing to note is that the land use classification for the MUC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| land use class, the removal of the plan district would also likely mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| the removal of the medium density residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| And so, because neither the MUCC designation or the CG zone caps density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| that could be something that you all want to consider at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| whether or not you want to include something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| We are recommending approval of the zoning because it brings it into alignment with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| sector plan and because it's more aligned with the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| And we are recommending approval of the plan development because the medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| that was originally proposed is closer to what the developer is considering now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| the departments, than the single lots along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| And so, now I'll open it up to see whatever questions you all might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| Mr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| When this case first was mentioned, you said it's the first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| where we're being asked to remove a master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3268)|
| 0:54:28| And did the request for removing that come from the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| or come from the community members that live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| It came from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| From the applicant, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| And then, is there anything in that process that asks the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3280)|
| 0:54:49| or requires the applicant to get or present some type of buy-in from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| the people who are currently living in, working in that master plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3295)|
| 0:55:04| We always strongly encourage for people to reach out and involve the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| but it's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| I'm not very smart, I guess, because this one confuses me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| just in following what we're doing and what the effect of that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| So, just so I'm clear, the developer is requesting a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3326)|
| 0:55:35| The effect of granting that zoning change will allow that property to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| exclusively for apartments without the requirement for retail and mixed uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3343)|
| 0:55:51| Am I understanding that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:54| So, the CG zone does allow multi-family developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| It's a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:02| And so, I'm down in that area a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| I eat in a couple of restaurants down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| It's really a cool place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| And I like what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| And I think it's got a nice mix of retail, apartments, shopping, the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| And so, I guess I'd like to see it continue to develop out that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| especially around that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| But, I mean, I just want to make sure that I'm understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| exactly what this zoning request, what the effect of it is, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3403)|
| 0:56:43| Well, the CR zone also allows multi-family developments as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| So, they could do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| It's just a question of what it would look like afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| So, the difference between the setbacks between CR and CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| So, right now, the minimum front setback for CR is 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| which for CG, they could build within 0 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| It's a build-to-zone instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| So, it pulls it up a little bit closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| It's kind of what the rest of the development, especially the commercial, looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| for minimum interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| And so, this, because it's surrounded by…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Basically, it's got streets along three sides of it and then along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| So, you've got interior side and then a front and then a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| And so, that's the setbacks that we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| And so, all of those are closer to the master plan than the CR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| And so, that's why we're recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| But the use itself could go in either way, into either zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| So…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3463)|
| 0:57:43| Does that…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| I don't know if I'm answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Yeah, I mean…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| So, you're saying…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Will we see a plan of what they want to do if this zoning request is granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| Will they be required to submit a plan or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Not if the master plan is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| If the plan district is removed and they submit for permits under either CR or CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| it would not come back before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:09| So, I mean, I don't know how we'd like that, but…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| So, they could pretty much do the same thing with the current CR2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| The only difference is we would get to review the plan they submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:23| So, CG…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| And so, both regional commercial and general commercial both allow, by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| So, if the plan development were removed and the rezoning were denied and it remains CR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| then they could still submit plans to permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| It wouldn't come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| It's just the removal of that plan district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| That means the plans don't have to come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| So, if you decide to rezone it but not remove the plan district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| then it would still have to come back before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| It would have to comply with either the master plan or the latest approved use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| or approved plan in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3545)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Just two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| One is, are the exhibits that Michelle has shown with the comparison tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| will that be in our staff report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| I think they're in addition, and I would like to study on them a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:33| So, the table is Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3576)|
| 0:59:36| Let me go back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| So, these tables here that are looking at the dimensional standards are Exhibit B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| as part of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| So, it's a comparison between the different zoning standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| And then this timeline and all of these images,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| they're all in Exhibit B under the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| And did the applicant give a reason for removing the plan development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3602)|
| 1:00:10| Did he state whether it was why he's asking for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| I think it's just because of the fact that the zoning ordinance has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| and now that it has to be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| it kind of gives them the freedom to be able to make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| And so, I know that they want to do some sort of multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| I haven't seen any plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| I don't know what that will look like specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| But they're looking to remove the plan district so that it frees them up to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| Did the plan district have any design, building design details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| or was it just a master site plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| It did have design details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| And I can send you a link to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| There's a lot of different ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| and I'd kind of have to weed through to find out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| which ones were the medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| I'm not super familiar with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| I might see if Mike Reynolds wants to jump in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| because I know he's done a lot with that particular zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| and has also reviewed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| So, he might be able to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| But with regard to the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| the CG zone has the highest amount of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| So, the third level of both CR and CG both have the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| And so, there's some that have to do with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| There's some that have to do with the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| Talks about fenestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| It talks about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| percentage of the building that has to be windows and doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| and where the entry can be, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| And so, that's all part of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| I believe it's table 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Or 5-2 in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| that has the different design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| between the CR and CG levels 1, 2, and 3, the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| And those are materials and links| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| that we can send you all between now and Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Two more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| The removing the planned district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| that would just impact this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| not the entire master plan, just that one area, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| Just this parcel, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| And then the second question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| because we've used the term planned district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| and planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| can I think of those two things as synonymous in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| No, if I've said planned development, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| I'm used to thinking of PD as planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| PD, in this instance, does stand for planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| And that's referring to that TC1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| that had the master plan associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Okay, so really, I should just think of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| in the terms of planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| We're only talking about the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| this district was master planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| And part of that is that we would see the plan come about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| if that planned district is retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| But if we remove that, then we don't see that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| It's very similar to how you all review like PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| how the plans have to come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| It's very similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Is there a difference in density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| between CR and CG as far as multi-zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| Neither zone specifies density specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| It's all just determined by the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| by the building height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| and by the size of the units that are proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| So basically, you have to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| what your buildable area is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| and then kind of go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| So it doesn't say, it doesn't cap it at anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| or it doesn't have a certain lot size for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| I don't see any other hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| We're going to move on to concept development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| special uses, use, and reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| So item number 15 is Woodbury Crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| You all are fairly familiar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| You received a lot of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| I'm going to turn it over to Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| Good afternoon, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| So as Amy mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| this is the Woodbury Crossing Development 12 SA-28C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| But we saw this during the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| and was proposed for an apartment complex in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| They're now proposing to re-establish the single-family lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| One difference between this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| and the original subdivision plan for Edwards Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| was what they're showing at Road A here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| cul-de-sacs short of Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| And in the original plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| it went across Beaver Creek and went into the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| So they're not going to be touching the hillside area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| on the south side of the creek with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| There are 79 lots in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| Just for comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| which they requested, had 80 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| So this has one less unit, you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| than the previous proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| They are showing sidewalks on one side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| and on all the street segments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| That's just as the original subdivision had proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| There is a condition that they flip this sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| on Edwards Place Boulevard to the west side, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| so it doesn't have this jogging situation going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| as you go north in Edwards Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| They're showing two connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| to the adjacent Twin Oak Landing subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| which we actually also reviewed back in the summer in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| One being the connection along Lawgiver Circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| that lines up with the proposed connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| from the adjacent subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| The other being a sidewalk connection down to the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| to the old Twin Oak Lane roadbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| There is a creek crossing there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I'm not sure if it would meet the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| that we would normally request of such a creek crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| but since it's there, that could be potentially utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| as a means for people to get across the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| And then the old roadbed could be potentially maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| and used as a path for people to get to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| and also to the school properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| which are to the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| There's also a Greenway easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| along the south side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| So hopefully sometime in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| there'll be a Greenway here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| So this sidewalk connection will also get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| to that potential future Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| The mid-block crossing here is needed at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| to get people over to this sidewalk connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| So it's at the high point of this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| and it's about as good of a spot as you can get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| considering the situation with the curves in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| In the staff report, we do see that there is a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| that they work with county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| to maintain as much visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| for this crosswalk as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| What's happening is this road is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| you're going up in elevation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| and also going around a turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| So we don't want to have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| where you have people crossing the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| coming up from behind cars, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| and just not being seen by the vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| coming around the corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| So that's something that they're going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| with county engineering on during design plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| Does anybody have any questions about this particular project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| I don't see any hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| One point I would like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| in the emails I read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| there's a lot of talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| whether things are going to be rental houses or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| It's my understanding that we don't consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| And just so for the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| just wanted to make sure I'm right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| That's similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| We don't typically get into size of house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| value of house, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| It's not something that we would get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| on a single family lot like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| Item number 17 is the Miller Farm subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| This is the proposal for the 93,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| I think it's 93 lot subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| on the recently rezoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| located at West Emery Road and Blacks Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Hey, Amy, I had a question on a previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| I raised my hand kind of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| That sidewalk connection to Twin Oak Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| is there currently a sidewalk in that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| or is that still under construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| In that subdivision or is that still undeveloped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| This portion is still undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| They are currently going through permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| I believe, for the part south of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| There's no guarantee that this back portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| of the property will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| We're kind of going through the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| that it will be at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| So we're still requesting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| that sidewalk connection be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| Certainly, it'll be developed at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| It's just a matter of when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| and then that sidewalk connection will be there and ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| Do their current site plans have a sidewalk planned for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| I'm just curious about how that would connect later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| Yes, so the neighboring subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| when we approved the Twin Oak Landing subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| that was the sidewalk segment from their cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| to the property line was in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| and it's going to be required to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| There is sidewalk then from on their road system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| going all the way to the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| So if that does get put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| and that would give everybody a direct route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| to the school on a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Yeah, so this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| went through rezoning a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| and now that they've obviously brought back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| the concept plan, use and review for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| The main issue, I guess there was a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| a couple of conditions on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| One being that they don't connect to Blacksberry Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| and another that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| I can't exactly remember how it was worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| There was a requirement for a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| right at the end of Patriot Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| or some kind of, I have to look it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| and see exactly the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| But anyway, I'll show you on a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| They're providing a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| to address the condition of the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| Let me get to the large size plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| Hold on just one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| Let's open this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Okay, so Emory Road is to the right side of the page here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| and Black Oak Berry, Patriot Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| which is a neighboring subdivision is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| They are providing a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| at the end of Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| So this will be a restricted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| They're not gonna have a future road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| or anything going through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| What it does allow for is potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| a sidewalk connection through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| to connect the two neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| I think that they're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| to the adjacent neighborhood about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| And they are considering putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| some kind of playground amenity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| or something along those lines on this site as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| Part of their approval is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| of their traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| or transportation impact study that they had completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| They are gonna be required to put in turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| a left turn lane on West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| And they don't need to put a decel lane necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| on for the southbound right turn into their subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| but there will be a hard shoulder there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| improved shoulder so people could slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| and kind of make that turn movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| a little bit easier into the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| There's a condition that these first lots here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| have a deeper driveway, a 30-foot driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| The building doesn't have to necessarily be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| or the house doesn't have to necessarily be 30 feet back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| But what we're wanting to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| is just create a little bit more off street parking space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| so that there's less chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| of somebody parking on the road right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Because what we got is a couple of quick turns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| or curves in the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| and you're also kind of going up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| So just to try to create a little bit safer entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| and exit from the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| to try to alleviate some potential on street parking need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| There is one lot that does have direct connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| to Blacksberry Road, lot 94 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4404)|
| 1:13:32| I think they're still really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| they show it as a buildable lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| It's pretty tough right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| It's got the buffers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| I think they're showing it as a buildable lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| and they hope to build a lot there or a house there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| but there's no guarantee necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| In the end, they actually will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| But this lot does have direct connection to Blacksberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| because that's the only actual connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| All these other lots that have frontage on Blacksberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| will connect back into the red system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| into the internal road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| There's one, I just want to show you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| there's one kind of nuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| in the staff recommendation on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| Let's see if I can get back to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| On the variances and alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| there's actually a recommended denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| of one of the alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4462)|
| 1:14:31| So alternative design standard number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| the applicant is asking for a horizontal curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| radius of 100 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| but staff were recommending approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| of a 200-foot horizontal curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| And I'll show you where that is on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| And basically with the road speeds here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| and the length of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| the 200-foot horizontal curve here and here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| are what the general engineering manuals would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| The subdivision regulations will require a 250-foot radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| but county engineering is willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| to go down to the 200-foot radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| So just so you know, there is that component of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| where staff was recommending approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| of one type of alternative design standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| but we're also recommending denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| of the 100-foot that they are requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4521)|
| 1:15:31| Any questions for Mike on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4531)|
| 1:15:40| Okay, seeing none, we will move on to item number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| This is the Emory Green subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| It's a development plan for a mix of detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| and attached residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| This is also Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Yes, thank you, Annie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| So this one, this property is also on West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| To the west of the other property that we just looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| Just kind of zooming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| This one is a little bit closer to the heart of Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| So familiar Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Here's the Carnes Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Carnes Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| and the Northwest Sports Complex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| So Carnes Valley Drive actually is just to the south of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| and then this is where West Emory kind of jogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| north of Carnes Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| So this property was rezoned not too long ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| to PR at five million per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| I'll just kind of turn off this for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| You can see that there's a blue line stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| coming through the east side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| They are showing all the buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| and everything that's required for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| And you'll see that there's some condo units to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| kind of sandwiched between Emory Road and the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| Then on the left side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| I'll turn, see if I can show it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| So there's a TVA easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| the power line easement that runs through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| and then there's condos on the west side of those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| So what's in between will be the single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| Sorry, let me get to, oops, wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| That's the plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| I guess, like I mentioned, here's the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| Zoom in a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Here's the creek, the single family lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| and then the condos on the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| and the condos on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| The only units that will have direct access to the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| are the condos on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| They have two driveway connections to West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| There's nothing of note to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| that was a concern with these two access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| They have plenty of sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| and separation from corners and all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| And then on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| and they do need to have a landscaping along the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| Here, they're proposing some reforestation in the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| Let me go to the reforestation plan real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| so it kind of gives an overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| or sorry, let me get back to it, the site view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| So what you're seeing in gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| is what they're wanting to reforest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| And then on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| there's a lot of landscaping on the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| that they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| In gray is what they're wanting to reforest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| So that's just some of their cut slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| Again, there's the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| So part of their grading that goes down towards the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| would have that reforestation and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| So if you have any questions about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| And they do show a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| or what they would propose for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| on the same plan sheet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| So this is the same engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| who's done the reforestation on other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| This is the same detail that they've used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| in those other projects as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| Let's see if there's anything else of note on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| For the condos, the driveways will be private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| They're not part of the road system for both of the condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| They show an amenity field area here below the power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| If you look at the topography map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| you can kind of see what they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| It's a pretty flat area for the residents to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| That's kind of a multi-use field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| Is there any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Mr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Yes, bear with me, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| I'm feeling my way through learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| But my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| because this is kind of a unique development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| with the single family and condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| My question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| understanding this is not something that we vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| it's not something that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| but do we know if any of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| if the developer has saved any of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| any of these housings in this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| as to be tagged for affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| No, we don't know exactly what they're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| You can kind of take a look at the elevations they have for the condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| and kind of get engaged maybe what their price range would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| Obviously, the condos would typically be more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| than the single family detached houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| That's not always going to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| That's my assumption is they would be more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| than the single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4845)|
| 1:20:45| Thanks for helping me build my knowledge base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| I don't see any other hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Oh, Commissioner Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| On the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| I see that there's an area for mailboxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Did they determine that that would be a central location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| for even the condos on the other side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| Because those people would have to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| and go around the block to get their mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4876)|
| 1:21:16| They actually, they do have a mailbox area here at the eastern condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| So they would have a separate mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4884)|
| 1:21:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| And I really didn't see it either until you asked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| and I kind of noticed it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| These could be broken up a bit more too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| as they get through the process with the postal service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| So you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Maybe there might be one over here in the condos too and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| But anyway, that yeah, it'll be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4907)|
| 1:21:47| And then was it determined that any turning lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| needed to be added to West Emory Road for these entrances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| I know this area gets backed up quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Not on West Emory in this area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| There wasn't a need for turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| With the bigger issue, and this is my kind of blame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| when you get to the overall zoning map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4930)|
| 1:22:18| I'm not extremely familiar with this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| going out there during busy times, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| But my understanding, it's like this Beaver Ridge intersection here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| and probably this Carrins Valley Drive intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| which are more congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| So the actual property boundary around this site itself shouldn't be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| This is some of these other intersections in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| that would need improvements over the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Let's move on to item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| This is 12B20UR, Huber Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| This one has a long history and is quite complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| And we will do our best to walk you through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4988)|
| 1:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| So this project is specific to this area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=4991)|
| 1:23:20| The south, I'm going to go ahead and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| it's the southwest corner of the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| And I'll show you that context here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| But I'm going to step you through what they're asking for first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| And if you approve, then we'll kind of talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| some of the other complexities of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| Let me go to the larger plans here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| Just to kind of lay it out a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| there's two parcels and one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| and then there's a couple of lots with this conservation area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| What you're seeing in the crosshatch is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| there are conservation areas that have already been platted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| and or I guess they're already been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| They already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| There's TVA flow adjustment area on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| But the condo or the apartment is going to go on top of the hill here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| So there's four buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| They're going to be three stories tall each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| Pellissippi Parkway is to the north on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| And then so West Emory or I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Emory Church Road in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| She is to the south, but they are having one driveway to come up the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| and access the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| There's an existing apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| on the opposite side of Emory Church Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| that has access somewhere around in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| It's to, you know, directionally, it's to the north of their access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| The design of these structures are, have a pretty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| I wouldn't say, they're not, it's not a flat roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| It is a low slope roof just to try to keep it under the 35 foot maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| that the state scenic highway requirements have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| for within a thousand feet of the Pellissippi Parkway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| The original plan for this had a parking kind of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| building A and B are located in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| Buildings located a bit further, I'd say to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| the backside of the site so that they wouldn't be as visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| from the main or from Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| This project will have its own clubhouse and amenities area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| Originally, this was going to be built as like a second phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| to the existing apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| And people who are in these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| were going to use the amenities across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| But this now is going to be a separate project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| with their own clubhouse and amenity area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| So they're not going to share those amenities anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| This kind of gives you an idea of their grading plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| The conservation areas are to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| actually to the east of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| and to the north of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| You know, they're staying out of those conservation areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| And to say that building B here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| actually sits lower than the hill around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| So what you're seeing with these contour lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| is actually going uphill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| And their property line on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| of the other property is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| the pretty much the high point of this hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| So this building will sit lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| this building will sit lower than the hill around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| to the north here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| This building will sit a little bit higher than the grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| So this one will probably be a little bit more visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| from Pellissippi Parkway than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| Say this one would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| They are proposing some landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| on the back side of building A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| to help shield it from the Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| But TDOT right away is to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| and they can't, you know, go into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| So the trees and vegetation that is there now will stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| So I'm not sure exactly how visible these would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| ultimately from Pellissippi Parkway anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| And as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| buildings themselves are pretty short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| with the low slope roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| So they're just trying to minimize the visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| as much as possible there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| So that's their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| That's 96 units total is what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| The original approval for the site had 72 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| And the original buildings were two stories tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| And these are three story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| So that's really when they got the extra units in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| is by adding that extra story to these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| So let me get to some of the complexities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| that we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| So 2013, this property was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| everything you see here in color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| is part of the original property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| development of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| And this colored map is really a plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| that was recorded in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| that shows different components of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| It's changed a little bit since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| but it kind of gives you an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| of what we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Our site is number seven down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| and it really includes number six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| and this conservation area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| So it's this kind of corner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| Pellissippi Parkway cuts the site off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| from some property on the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| That's part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| So 2013, they requested rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| from agriculture to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| And ultimately they were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| for planned residential up to 5 billionths per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| After they got the approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| it's actually the use and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| for the property pretty much went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| which is kind of unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| a little different than we handle it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| But they were requesting 240 apartment units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| on lot number five here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| There was originally a proposal for a marina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| on this agricultural portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| And then also some marina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| some marina components on this lot four at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| And there was two units here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| This property is still left on unbuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| It's really hard to get the access wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| and we don't really need to go into that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| But ultimately there was conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| of the zoning approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| One was to plat these conservation areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| that you see in green on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| Another one was to not disturb the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| until a use and review development plan was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| And the other one had to do with this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| and providing some conservation area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| and public access on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| whenever a development plan comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| But it was kind of vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| If I recall on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| I'd have to pull out exactly what it said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| But ultimately, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| there was 240 units built here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| Two single family houses built on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| and there's now one single family house here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| What is ultimately kind of an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| is that this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| well, what you see in orange here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| and what you see in kind of this light purple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| were sold off to other owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| This orange property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| there was a use and review for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| Actually, the 2013 use and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| showed this as being two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| which ultimately was built out at two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| This one was shown as part of the marina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| but come to find out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| when the use and review was approved in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| the day of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| who's also the same developer with this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| requested that the marina component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| be removed from this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| And so the development plan approved at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| did not have a marina on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| But part of the issue is that the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| didn't really have a development plan approved on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| other than just nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| In 2017, I believe, the site was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| Maybe it was 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| It was sold to somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| who has since built one house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| You can kind of see these things on the aerials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| But let me go back to the map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5528)|
| 1:32:17| So this is where the marina was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| Here's the apartments that have already been constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Part of the issue is that we're trying to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| what kind of arrangement there was on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| Was there an agreement that that one house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| was the only thing that that particular person was allotted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| when it was sold to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Do they retain any development right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| based on the acreage that they own at PR5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| And ultimately, I think what we're going to need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| is get something from this property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| either saying or from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| but saying that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| really this lot only retains one unit of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| The rest of the density is transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| to the rest of the development on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| back to the applicant to distribute to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| or to other undeveloped properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| I think there's six plus acres here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5601)|
| 1:33:30| That's above the 820 line of the flow adjustment for TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| And if those full acres come out of this density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| for the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| then I think they're going to be a little short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| of the density needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| If they're able to retain that density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| then they're going to be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| They'll have some extra density on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| So that's something that we're still trying to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| and hopefully we'll have resolved by Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| If not, then we may need to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| once we can clearly define what the density is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| I'd just like to suggest again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| that we move along a little faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5658)|
| 1:34:18| Noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Mike, am I correct in that the density issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| you're trying to balance out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| is that they were approved for 72,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| they've moved to 96,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| and so you're trying to help them achieve the 96| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| in a kosher fashion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Have I tracked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Yeah, we're trying to make sure that what they're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| that they actually have the density necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| to request what they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| Yeah, that's the gist of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Okay, I don't see any other hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| I'm having a bit of a hard time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| kind of understanding the overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| From the case file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| I saw that it was like 4.68 dwelling units per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| Dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| and it's 24.29 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| That's a total of 113.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| and then I can imagine hillside plays into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| You were kind of talking about surrounding parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| How are those impacting this particular parcel of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| And do you know if they're planning to phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| another portion of apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| on the area that's not a conservation area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5741)|
| 1:35:48| Well, I'll just start with the last part there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| With the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| assuming that there's no density concern with that one lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| that they can transfer all the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| off of it based on their acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| they're not going to have a whole lot of units left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| So the chance that there being like another apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5767)|
| 1:36:15| or another building here is probably fairly unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| There is the land on the opposite side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| of Custody Parkway over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| that potentially could have some units on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| The problem is access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| You see this property is owned by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| and they have Pell City Parkway to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| So there's really not direct access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| They're gonna have to gain access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| either through the Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| There's a road right away right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| that potentially they could come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| But there's not a lot of other land to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| Several units on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| I think they're in the 20s or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| This might be a more general question where I'm still new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| Does that density apply to overall land owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| by one particular owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| or would this just be exclusively for this parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| So there's the developer that applied here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| It owned everything when they bought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| and they rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| So they retain like some development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| of those rezoned properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| based on their original development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| So they can still transfer some things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| I guess the question, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| is how much of the land is owned by the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| In my mind and to others, it's kind of this lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| And what kind of right do they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| to shift that density off of it after they sold it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| For instance, there was actually a third lot approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| over here on this two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| But when they came in for use on review approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| they actually had to get permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| from the overall developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| to add one unit to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| So they couldn't just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| They couldn't just request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5909)|
| 1:38:29| Even though they had the acreage to get the third unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| they had to actually request that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| from the real property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| because they were only allocated two units at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| So it's kind of a weird dynamic happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| Yeah, it's very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| I appreciate that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| I want to be, it's, let's see what time it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| It's eight after one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| I want to be respectful of everybody's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| If you, we have two more agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| We can either, we can continue on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| if you all would like for us to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| or we can shift any kind of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| that we might have to the Thursday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| What is the preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Amy, if you could hit these last two relatively quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| if they're not real complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| let's try to get them taken care of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| So the next one is item number 20, 11F20UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| This is Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| I'll just go ahead and quickly turn it over to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| to review the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5969)|
| 1:39:29| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I'm going to share my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5971)|
| 1:39:50| Sorry, I think that it's not working right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Let me try to open it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| And Liz, you'll probably want to talk a little bit louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6004)|
| 1:40:14| While Liz is doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| can I ask a question that probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| can be answered quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| Am I reading the case file correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| that the property, the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| at this point, we're in the use and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| and that it is for a 12-person residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| I mean, it's a boarding house home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| but it's a 12-person one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| That is what their application states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| It's in terms of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| and any deviation from that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| and what might happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| When you're presenting the case, Liz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| if you can include some of those items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| So this is the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Let me see if this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| Are you seeing it full screen size now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6085)|
| 1:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| So you may remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| This went through last month for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| This is at the end of Zion Lane off of Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| It's in a low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| large lot, agricultural sort of area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| adjacent to a ridgeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| This is what the surrounding zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| looks like for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| It is in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| so it's surrounded by agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| as well as RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| which is the general residential zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| and RA, which is the low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| Hey, Liz, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| Did we not rezone that to agricultural last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| Yes, so the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| voted to approve it for agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| It's noted in the blue sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| that was sent out for this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| that it is pending a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| by County Commission for Agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Their meeting, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| is on December 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| so we will know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| but the applicants are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| to submit for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| but they're doing so at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| if the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| were to vote down this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| It would nullify the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| Yeah, but isn't the boarding house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| related to the zone for agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| So technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| they can't have a boarding house at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| but we're still proceeding with the hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| They're doing so at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| so it doesn't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| They can't pull building permits for this use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| if their zoning doesn't align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| So since you all are familiar with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| I just kind of wanted to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| on what our recommendation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| The type of use here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| this is the site plan that they have submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| I've shown in yellow boxes on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| where the sort of rooms are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| for the borders that are noted on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| and then the red boxes are where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| they're noted as being apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| or I suppose these are areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| where staff would stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| and I'm sure the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| will have more information to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| about the arrangement of their site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| and who would stay where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| and the capacity of this at the Thursday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| However, I wanted to highlight in yellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| where the 12 potential borders are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| and then also that there does appear to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| at least one additional boarding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| and depending on who would stay in these apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| it appears to me that the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| would potentially exceed the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| of what a boarding home is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| which is described as a dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| or part thereof in which lodging is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| and mills from a common kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| are provided by the owner or operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| for not more than 12 persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| So I think given their site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| it appears that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| potentially get more than 12 persons there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| It's staff's review of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| This is incompatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| with the surrounding land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| that are largely single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| and insufficient infrastructure exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| to support this use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| particularly because it does appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| that the borders will not have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| to their own cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| and will be reliant on vans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| to take them to and from the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| The other zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| that allow boarding houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| as a use by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| are the CA and CB zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6359)|
| 1:45:59| which are just commercial zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| sort of lending to this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| that this is more of a commercial type use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| It's a fair number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| residing in one structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| The types of activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| that we could see possibly occurring here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| might involve laundry service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| and or food delivery service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| especially since they have a common kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| So staff is recommending denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| of this use on review based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| This location is also not near transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| or other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| that this type of border population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| might be relying on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| What was that building used for before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| I believe it originally was used for a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| and then I believe it was used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| as a children's home at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| Liz, we keep announcing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| as a boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| It's actually a drug rehabilitation facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| So the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| has not said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| drug rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| would be part of their program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| and I think hopefully we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| Steve Elliott from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| on the call on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| along with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| who can sort of speak more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| to what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| They've provided as part of the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| sort of what their borders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| will be participating in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| what activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| It sounds like it is supposed to be geared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| towards life skills training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| So Liz, when it was a children's home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| was it operating outside the allowed zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| So I am not aware of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| that would have been interpreted as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| when it was a children's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| I could try to do a little research into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6486)|
| 1:48:13| It may have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| it may have fallen under a group home type definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6494)|
| 1:48:21| And that's different than what they were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| Boarding house, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| I might call on Steve Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| He has his hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Steve, do you have anything to add here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Yes, I think the most current use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| was an assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| I think the children's home was years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| maybe even prior to the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| being in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| So I think the most current use there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| was an assisted living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| which is an allowed use in the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| And, you know, that was the previous zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| Okay, Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6534)|
| 1:49:02| Oh, Commissioner Smith, we still can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| It looks like you're unmuted, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6547)|
| 1:49:16| No, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| Okay, we'll come back to you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| Yeah, I just wanted to make a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| I want us to be real careful about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| you know, making assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| about a drug rehab place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| because I thought that at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| the applicant stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| and I could be mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| I thought he said these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| were not here for drug rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| They were just people who had had a hard time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| and were getting back on their feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| in terms of just learning to cook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| and care for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| But I thought he said that the drug rehab thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| came from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| And I just, I want us to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| we get that right before we say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| And then also on one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| I see a map where it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| there's various traffic patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| that have been examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Is this for a fire truck or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| The fire department reviewers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| had asked for them to demonstrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| sort of, I think, turning radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| Are there issues with access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| with access for a fire truck or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| So I believe, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| Is it just that it works or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| Yeah, so I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| they will have to meet whatever is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| to be able to pull building permits for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| I think that they've noted on their site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| that this will also be sprinklered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| But yes, I think what they're trying to demonstrate there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| are comments related to fire suppression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| Okay, last question is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| when you've got a property that's zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| and we're assuming it's zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| and you have a use on review request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| how do we weight compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| with the fact that it's a use on review in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| in terms of when we evaluate what's an appropriate use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Can anybody give me some guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| about what do we put the weight on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| Is it how it meshes in with the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| or is there such a weighted decision we use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| Anybody can tell me that maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| I'm not really sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| Okay, in a use on review in a zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| is the compatibility of that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| to the surrounding properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| is that what we should place a lot of weight on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| in deciding whether this is a good use or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| I believe that's the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| of the use on review classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| are that these are types of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| that may create some potential conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| and should be further evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| with the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| Those are good comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| because I had met similar ones that I wanted to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| but I do have a couple in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| The comment staff made was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| I guess, insufficient infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| I'm having trouble, I guess, with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| If senior living was there at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| tell me what infrastructures are deficient in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| that wouldn't have been deficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| in the senior living case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6794)|
| 1:53:21| I'm not sure that we evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Has a use on review come in for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| for that use list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| I did not see that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| I thought I saw in your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| that the infrastructure wasn't adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| I thought I heard in your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| As far as previous review of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| for senior assisted living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| I don't think that we reviewed that use when it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| Yeah, I just want to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| 2012, there was a use on review approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| for assisted living facility at the 10 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| So I don't know if that was actually ever implemented though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| It was at least approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| So my point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| because I think there have been comments on this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| that the infrastructure is insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| And if it was sufficient for a senior living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| I'm just trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| what infrastructure would be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| than the senior living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| And I guess if there's only one residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| that allows this use being agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| if we're talking about public transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| I don't know, maybe I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| but I can't imagine a lot of public transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| in agriculture zonings, but maybe there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| Yeah, no, I would say that public transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| played into the comment of insufficient infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| And the notation that this area is largely rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6903)|
| 1:55:13| and at the end of a dead end local street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6913)|
| 1:55:20| and the surrounding area doesn't provide transit service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6920)|
| 1:55:37| Well, I can quickly note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| that when the assisted living was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| there was a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| that the Zion road be widened up to 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| and be a paved surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| And I don't believe that it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| I think it's about 16 feet right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| So that'd be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| would probably need to be addressed as Zion Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| and whether the 16 feet is sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| or if it needs to be widened out to that 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| as the assisted living facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| was previously required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| Commissioner Hill, any follow-up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| Yeah, I'd like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| Something was mentioned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| they wanted to be sure and get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| If you go back about 30, 40 days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| Angelic Ministries had on their webpage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| asking people to sign a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| for their projected rehabilitation center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| going in on Zion Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| And I think the guy did admit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| during my comments last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| that this was a rehab center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| But I don't think a rehab center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| needs to be in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| of this particular neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Yeah, two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| One about the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| which, Liz, is there any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| if the site plan and the 12 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| and the boarding house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| and all of those requirements are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| is there any chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| or does there any impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| with the exceeding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| being potentially staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| Are they counted in the border headcount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| in that tabulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| I think I will inquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| with Knox County Codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| about their interpretation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| Hey, Liz, Steve Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| I have had discussion with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| There is only allowed 12 per dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| would be our interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| The building code does allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| if they put in a building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| if they put in a firewall of some sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| they could make this two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| They have enough property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| to get two dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| So they could put in a firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| and create two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| out of this building and get up to 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| would be my staff's interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| That's really helpful to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| The other, this is sort of a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7100)|

| 1:58:30| that has been referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| like public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| needing to be adequate for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| I'm trying to deal with the tension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| that seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| or the friction that exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| with this definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| that in one instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| we do not want individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| to have freedom of movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Yet in another instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| we do want them to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| freedom of movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| When we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| rehabilitation centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| or boarding houses, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| in other cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| and I'm just trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| that definition of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| figured out in my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| and how that's being applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| And if I need to restate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| So I guess I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| that the use in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| for this case strikes me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| as more commercial in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| than a residential type use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| it's a fair amount of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| on one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| The site is just over four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| Again, as Mr. Elliott noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| I guess if they were to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| you know, make a firewall there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| they might be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7186)|
| 1:59:46| to accommodate 24 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| So, you know, that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| if you were to just have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| 14 people on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| you know, that would be about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| five, five and a half people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| per acre and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| or sorry, three and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| people per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| So if you were to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| that would be six and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| people per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| If you were to look at like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| family size, it's 2.5 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| is assumed in a family unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| So they could get an upwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| of 10 families at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| I mean, it's a fair amount of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| I feel like it functions more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| as a commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| because of the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| than single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| So that's why I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| the infrastructure evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| as being more commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| This is coming in as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| So as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| we're looking at not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| that it's a boarding house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| but how it is used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| as a boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| And the question I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| since they are taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| the occupants away every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| for pretty much all day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| and then bringing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| back in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| I don't see the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| on the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| because rather than 12 cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| they're going to have one van| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| and then the few staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| And so I'm just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| when we're looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| as a boarding house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| we're looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| as a boarding house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| for the exact purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| and concept that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| the applicant is stating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| If the applicant leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| that boarding house use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| has to end until someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| comes in with another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7327)|
| 2:02:07| So we're not really concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| about a lot of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| at least as far as the occupants go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| up and down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| There could be commercial trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| coming in to the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| say for laundry service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| or food service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| Yes, you're quite right about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| My other last question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| given the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| of boarding house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| is the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| even legally allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| to consider approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| since it fails to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| a boarding house definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| Can you repeat that question, Sandra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7364)|
| 2:02:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| I've got background noise too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| I mean, per the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| this is not a boarding house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| because it's more than 12 occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| And therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| I don't see the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| can even consider approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| I'm just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7393)|
| 2:03:21| whether I'm right or wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| on wondering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| Liz, you care if I interject here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| Yeah, please jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| Yes, Ms. Korblick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| It would be the code's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| administration's interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| that is a boarding home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| is a dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| and would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| 12 per dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| The Ag Zone would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| if they have two acres of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| So it'd be our interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| that they could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| two dwelling units on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| and 12 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| in each boarding home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| So they would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7444)|
| 2:04:04| two separate kitchens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Well, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7445)|
| 2:04:13| I guess I didn't think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| Dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| they have to have a separate kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| I just, I'm not comfortable legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| if we can even consider approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| based on that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| Let me think that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| and talk it over with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| and I'll have you an answer on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| I guess my initial take on it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| you would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| They would need two kitchens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| for each dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| I agree with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| in that I recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| the applicant last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| saying that it would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| a drug rehabilitation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| The people that would stay here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| would do so voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| It wouldn't be anything court ordered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| and they would have to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| a clean drug test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| in order to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| So right off the bat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| when someone's moving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| they are drug free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| and they're learning life skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| to get back on their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| Just kind of to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| what I recall from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| And then they'll be providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| a private van service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| which negates the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| for public transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| because the assumption with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| you know, private van service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| is that these men will not be leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| unless they're doing it via van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| So I'm not sure as far as infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| whether transit lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| bus lines would be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| And then the other infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| I could think of would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| you know, sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| But as it stands that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| doesn't need, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| sidewalks in order to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| And then again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| the van service would cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| the need to have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| So I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| there's insufficient infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| What else was I going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| I can see the need for like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| maybe food delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| for the sake of the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| But I don't see why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| any of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7586)|
| 2:06:26| that would reside here would leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| And then I saw that Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| in the chat was saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| you know, wouldn't this have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| to come back before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| if capacity was increased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| I would agree with that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| just because if they need to build a firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| and increase to 24 residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| that would obviously require our approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| or it would be automatically denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| if the max already as it stands is 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| So I don't know that there's potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| future growth for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| So just some comments, some thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| I guess I'm a little confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| about the van issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| Where it says in item three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| under conformity of the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| the type of use proposed may require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| is it may or shall or will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| I mean, does it necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| prevent them from having vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7638)|
| 2:07:23| No, my interpretation is it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201208-agenda-review?start=7643)|
