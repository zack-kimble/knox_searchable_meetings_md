| 0:02:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Officially the light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| I'm sure you're familiar with the circumstances that led to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| injunction of the property adjacent to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| And so I do have some concerns about the security of the overall area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| and the property and the interaction between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| So as part of that, in the injunction of the other property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| I need to ask a few questions associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| Is that previous owner of this property involved in this new business at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Are you aware that Mr. Nichols has any stake in this business at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| or silent interest or anything to do with the operations of his business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| You know, security in this area is very fragile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| and there's not a lot of trust in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| And so I was going to ask if you could discuss some of the security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| measures that you hope to put in place for the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| I'm short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| So some of the security measures we've put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| we have our metal detector at the front door for all of our patrons to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| through before they can even leave out of our front lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| We have a security or a staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| usually one of our security guards that sits at the front door to monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| We have someone walking the parking lot consistently for them to not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| out there loitering or hanging around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| And we've also changed some of our hours from 7 to 3 on the weekends to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| where previously they were open until 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| kind of got that after crowd after they had already been drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| So changing our hours since we've been open has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| it has shown a drastic change in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| I know there was security in the parking lot in the previous owner and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| that wasn't sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| So I've come at this with a little bit of skepticism to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| So I hope that you can make a change in this business, in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Do you own and operate the other business adjacent to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| I asked for the police department to pull a list of issues for the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| since you've been open and there's already been almost 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| So now those haven't all made the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| but neighbors calling for disturbance or theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| This body, I've looked into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Could I comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Apparently somebody had a sense that they had left a cell phone in the VIP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| We have 49 cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| And when the police officer came to check on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| they found that there was no cell phone even back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| So that would actually be false even though somebody called in and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Some of the calls have been around noise and all of those stem from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I'm not going to get into each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| I just want you to be aware of the sensitivity that there are calls that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| have already been reported by the neighbors for that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| And while this body can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| if you've followed the stages to earn the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| this body can't prevent you from doing that because you haven't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| established yet with the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| However, this body does have the ability to revoke that beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| And I just wanted to read something as a heads up as incentive to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| in a very particular manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Section 4-73C of the city ordinances will allow this beer board to revoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| the permit if disorderly conduct chronically occurs on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| So, again, I come at this with skepticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| I hope you operate better than the previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| Yeah, we're looking to apply with anything that the city or the law decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| We know a lot of the officers that come down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| and I was happy to see that we were the ones that actually took the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| or purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| So we're just looking to go along with everybody and we will abide with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| And I'm cheering for you all to be successful, so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| I don't have any other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| I'll be quiet for some of my colleagues if they have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| The person who will be patrolling the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| is that going to be a hired either off-duty or security individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| or is that going to be an employee of yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| It will be an employee of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| I think the previous owner had hired an outside security company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and they were unable to build a relationship with the patrons that come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| so it was more of like a battle of power in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| So it will be one of our security guys that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| because we build the relationships with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| And, again, I think the difference that's going to be is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| we're not going to be open past 3 o'clock for the after-hours party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| where they're already coming in intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| But it will be one of our security guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| I mean, I hope they'll be in the establishment versus in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| Can I add a small comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Yeah, most of those problems occurred in between the 3 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| in which we're trying to buy it and just be open until 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| So, yeah, anyways, just basically hopefully that will help with any of the larger crowds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| There used to be like 200 people out there at that particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| and now those people aren't out there anymore like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| So that definitely helps out a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Yeah, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| This might be a question for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| So the other establishment was open past 3 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Is that what I hear you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| It used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| What are the laws pertaining to establishments open past 3 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Are they allowed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Well, I believe you can have a setting aside alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| there are places that are 24-hour establishments, Walgreens, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| But the hours of retail sale actually have it upright here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| It's prohibited between 3 a.m. and 10 a.m. on a Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| and it cannot be between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. on all other days of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| That's what the ordinance says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| So there's a two-hour break between retail sales of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=569)|
| 0:09:36| Six days a week and a seven-hour break on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| So they can be open, they just can't serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| And that's what this other establishment was doing, not serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Used to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| We're not looking to be open past 3 at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| Yeah, we're shutting down at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Maybe I shouldn't get into what were they doing from 3 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| If I may, that's where the trouble was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| So the previous business that operated in this area stayed open until 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| They stopped selling alcohol at 3, but they stayed open until 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| and all the problems were in the parking lot between 3 and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| And as I understand from Mr. Powers and Ms. Fisher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| you aim to prevent that by being closed by 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| I'm just curious what was happening at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| KPD has a long list of what was happening at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| I could comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| Basically what was happening right there is that all the other clubs in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Knoxville, a lot of them were shutting down at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| And then everybody wanted to go to our club because it was still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| So sometimes you would have like a whole house full of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| and then there would be probably 200 or 300 people in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| It just became a place for them to go between 3 and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| and then that's when all the problems kind of started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| So we don't open at that time anymore to prevent that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Okay, so you're going to close at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| And what time are you reopening the next day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| We don't open until currently right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| We don't open until 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| We are looking at possibly backing it up to 4 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| but our hours, the most they would ever be is 4 p.m. to 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| Okay, so at 3 a.m., when you close and everybody has to walk out the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=687)|
| 0:11:35| are they going to be getting in the cars and leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| or are they going to be told they have to leave the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| or are they going to have an after party in the parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Right now what we've been doing, and this is without the bar site open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| is we've started turning the house lights on around 2.30, 2.45-ish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| to kind of get everybody to go ahead and go outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| That way it gives our staff 30 minutes to kind of work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| getting out of the parking lot before we let any of our staff leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| So we've not had – our main issue that happened was coming from other clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| They were already intoxicated, and when they were just sitting in the parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| they didn't have to follow any rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| and then it wound up with this group getting into an argument with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| And we had people out in the parking lot blasting their car stereos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| with their systems in it, which led into the noise complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=743)|
| 0:12:32| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Just one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| I would make sure that you have an open line of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| with the neighborhood around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Just the best way to make sure that there's a good relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| is to start with one, and so I appreciate everything you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Given everything in the packet and everything that's allowed of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| I'm going to move to approve pending final documentation and wish you the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=786)|

| 0:18:43| about signing a lease to open my own bar in that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1123)|

| 0:18:52| developments that are going to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1132)|

| 0:18:58| So we'll still be neighborhood cocktail bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| We'll do a little fun events and stuff like that, but still good old neighborhood cocktail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1140)|

| 0:19:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1156)|

| 0:19:39| forward after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| I have all of my other paperwork done, and once I get the building inspection, I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| a direct contact with TABC for an agent to come and do my liquor licensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| And after that, I hope to be pretty good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| So I'm psyched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1192)|

| 0:20:09| I think I remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Look at Jack Neely's book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| It was an Irish bar called Cavanaugh's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1213)|

| 0:20:17| Oh, did they really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| I didn't know that history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| I knew that it used to be a saloon, I guess, when it started in the commercial space in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| the bottom, but I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| That's really cool to hear about that upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Good luck carrying on the tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1226)|

| 0:20:54| Actually, it was just in KnoxNews.com this morning, so I don't know if you got to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| that, but if you haven't, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| We don't have our opening date quite set yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| We're pending some sort of delay with the permits from the city, but everything's submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| from the architects, and it's just a waiting game at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| So, yeah, so far, so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1274)|

| 0:21:30| It's barbecue-based, so we do have a smoker, so yes, I'll be doing brisket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| But I'm a chef, and I'm also playing with other proteins as well, so fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| I'm actually stepping into some oat proteins and more vegan options as well, so it'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| a nice concept, and it's designed to specifically fit downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| I don't know if you recall a year ago, we actually had a building on Cumberland that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| we were looking to move into, and that was kind of based on being a campus bar with barbecue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| and they're doing that big redevelopment for more student housing now, so we were very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| happy to find a building on Gay Street and snag it, so we're kind of in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| stages of getting it going as far as construction goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1333)|

| 0:24:09| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Next up are our addendum items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| First is Lucky Shot Billiards, Sports Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1460)|
| 0:24:29| My name is Kenny Harris, Lucky Shot Billiards, 6021 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| You want to give us an update on where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| We're about to get things kind of wrapped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| We had some issues once we got our permits, finding plumbers and stuff like that to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| They were either shorthanded or they just couldn't get to us, but now we're in the phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| We're about halfway through the plumbing, and I think they're starting the filtration systems next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| So we're hoping to be done with everything sometime in the late part of December, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| and hoping to open up sometime right after the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| So you think 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Yeah, I think that would be plenty enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Motion on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| No motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Mr. Harris, we've spoken a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| I'm excited to see you all open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Typically, if it comes, this lingers on this long, we typically make folks restart the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| or redo a background check, but I feel confident in one more 90-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| so I'll move to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Have a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Next is Lunaverse, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Bernadette West, 26 Market Square, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| How's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Well, it turns out I thought I was going to try to make it easier by doing something outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| but it seems like it's taking the scale of what we wanted to do is beyond the scope of what the city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1572)|
| 0:26:24| wanting us to do at this point or the permit application, because we were trying to have the concert series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| which we have done in the past on Market Square, we were trying to move it to the parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| that was outside the buildings without actually having people inside the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| which we thought was going to be an easier process to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| However, now we have to rezone the parking lot so that it can be used for what we want to do on the larger scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1606)|
| 0:26:55| So what we're trying to do now is have the beer permit being on a smaller scale and not have as big as a event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1615)|
| 0:27:07| until we can get the parking lot rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| How long do you think you're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| How much longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| For me, I would like it to happen really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| However, the process of doing that, I'm hoping with the holidays coming up, I don't know, but hopefully another 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1642)|
| 0:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| I move to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| We might have to have you guys help us in getting that changed, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| because we're trying to get that area at 940 Blackstock to be incorporated into the downtown district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| because we're trying to tie in where the old city is, where the city is having that greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1685)|
| 0:28:14| where they're taking out the railroad tracks to connect with the World's Fair site and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| And so we're thinking that we're going to try to extend that downtown district to include that area where we're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| which will help us in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Ms. West, who are you talking to at the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Well, with the building department and the city planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| And we're just in the initial stages with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| We met last week with the building on trying to facilitate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| and there are a lot of other things that we're trying to do to make it a larger scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| and that's why we're trying to incorporate into downtown district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| and tie it into the World's Fair site, UT, and the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| just kind of expanding the borders of the downtown district to include this area where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| So I think what you need to do is probably reach out to Mr. Cannon, Harold Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Harold Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Cannon, C-A-N-N-O-N, like a cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| And talk with him because he might be able to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| What department is he in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| What's his new title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Economic Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Sometimes you're talking to the folks that get the work done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| and you might need to talk to somebody that might be able to coordinate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| so at least you can get a yes or a no answer on the possibility of some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| So I would go to the city's website and just look up Harold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| or when you talk to somebody in the building department, ask for his contact info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Or if we wrap here in a minute, I can give you his email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| He'll be here shortly, if you want to touch base with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| He'll be here for the 6 o'clock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| So is the rezoning, I'm just curious, precludes you from opening, or would you—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Well, no, for opening, if we can just set the groundwork with a smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| kind of just having a little park area with food trucks and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| buying beer and just, like, throwing Frisbees and stuff like that on the outside of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| and not do the larger scale, which is what we had intended for when we first applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| which should be easy, but we need to be able to make sure we have the permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| before we get the bigger bands because they always want money in advance or at least half of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| So we don't want to commit to that larger concert series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| if we're not going to be able to do it on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| So we're trying to scale it down to just kind of, you know, more—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| kind of like what the central, you know, beer—the food trucks there are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| You can have a gathering of people, and you can sit outside and drink beer and have something to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Your building's the concourse, the old concourse, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah, but we're not—well, and we are going to develop that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| but we don't want to have anything in there right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| because that's going to take a lot of money to kind of renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| and get up to code in that before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| So we thought that because of everybody wanting to be outside more than inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| that we would start outside and utilize that money that we're generating from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| to start developing the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| But we do plan on developing the inside also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1913)|

| 0:32:00| To extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| I know, like, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Okay, next is Taka Madras, Taqueria and Bar Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| Madras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Yes, Eduardo Vila, 1915 Mahogany Wood Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| You want to tell us a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Yeah, we've been trying to open for, like, three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| but we had to upgrade the sprinkler system in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| It was the old Don Pablo's building, so it's been empty for, like, 10, 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| So we have to upgrade a lot of the things in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| So we have the final phase of the sprinklers done Tuesday, as last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| and I think the fire marshal is coming Monday next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| to do his final inspection for a CO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| and the building inspector is coming with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Health department came last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| They approved everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| They're just waiting for the CO, fire marshal, to approve the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| So you're close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| You think 30 days, or you want us to give you 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Monday is the day that he's coming for a CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| I mean, I got cooking equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| I got everything hooked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Everything's ready just to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| I spoke to Laker, and they want me to give my CO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| and she said once I give my CO, it takes two weeks to get Laker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| So hopefully 30 days will be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| I mean, I've been waiting for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| I'll make a motion to approve or make a motion to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2010)|

| 0:33:43| You don't have to take the whole 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| We're just in case it's 31 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2026)|

| 0:33:52| and hopefully I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Which old building are you in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Don Pablo's right there where the old mall used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Yeah, that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2037)|

| 0:34:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| How's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| We had also a sprinkler issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| The building didn't have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| so we had to work with KEB to get 17th Street shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| which is not easy, and get that main water line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| get a new roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| So all that's done now, mainly now it's just cosmetic stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| and just installing some bar equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-221115?start=2088)|
