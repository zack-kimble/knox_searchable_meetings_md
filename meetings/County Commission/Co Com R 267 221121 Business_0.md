| 0:12:49| And it's kind of funny, side note, when we built that station, some of you all were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| we thought that that would lighten the load on the Hall station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=774)|

| 0:16:58| The only requirement is we have to install them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| We can't just give them to a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| We have to physically install them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| That's a requirement from the state fire marshal's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1024)|

| 0:17:26| On this fire alarms that you will install, or smoke detectors, do people have to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1046)|
| 0:17:36| in your subscriber zone, and do they have to be members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| We will install them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Now, we can't respond to them in Descartes, or Seymour, or the city, but we can, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| install them for anybody, whether they're a member or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| We want them to be a member, but because it comes through the state, we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| a choice but to install them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| And they're that important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| You know, it's kind of, it would be kind of counterproductive for us to advertise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| importance of them, and then say, no, you've got to be a subscriber, otherwise, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| it's kind of defeating your own purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| But yes, we will put them anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| So it's regardless of subscription, and did you say, and also regardless of location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| No, I can only do it in our response area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1099)|

| 0:18:25| But if I'm not mistaken, Carnes and Seymour has the same program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| They all, as far as I know, they all do it through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Just out of curiosity, how many turkey gone wrong fires do you get calls for during Thanksgiving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| Well, it's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Some years we'll go, we'll skip years without having a turkey gone wrong deep fryer incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| But I can promise you, if you just watch the news, there will be one somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| It may not be in Knox County, but it will happen somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| And I mean, and all we did today was simply elevate the temperature way beyond what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| was supposed to be, which took some effort on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| And we had, we had enough heat and fire shooting out of the pot for about 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| And if it rains on Thursday, there'll be somebody that will do it in their garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Oh, yeah, it'll happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| But it'll be other cooking related emergencies as well, not just a deep fryer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Happy Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Ms. Stephanie Candler to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Stephanie Candler, 400 Main Street, Knox County HR and Benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| So I won't bore you with the 24 items listed on the entire summary of our personal plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| update because some of it's just details that publicly you don't want to sit through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| and have to listen to, but I'll highlight the top three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| So big thanks, first of all, to our law department for working with us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| David Wiggler and Houston Havasy were instrumental in helping us clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| One of the major things we did was clean up the language in the handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| We had some laws broken out that we feel might change over the next four years, and we plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| on reviewing this in a four-year cycle with the election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| So part of that was to be able to get us on par with the election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| Basically things like the EEO policy, how we file complaints, what we do with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| how we follow up, and a blanket statement that we're going to comply with all federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| and state laws when it comes to employment covers us more than trying to break out every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| law that exists federally or statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| So that's the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| The second one that I'll highlight that we're happy to add is two extra days for bereavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| So we previously had three days, and we've added two more so that we have five days for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| bereavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| It's the trend, the norm now for most employers to offer five days of bereavement leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| That just allows a lot of people who have families out of state time to travel, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| they don't have to take that consecutively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| So we did allow them to also take a little bit of time if they need to come back to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| and do some work, they can come back and then still take their additional days of bereavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| And then the big one would be under our FMLA policy, we have added eight weeks of paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| maternity and paternity leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| This does apply to the executive branch and any of the offices that adopt that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| within their handbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| The electeds all have that ability, and it's not really a one-size-fits-all for all offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| but most have adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| So I'd like to thank Mayor Jacobs for bringing that to us several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| Chairwoman Durrett actually brought it a couple of years ago in conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| And so we had done our homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| We know there are no negative effects of paid maternity or paternity leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| There's a very long-term, really lifelong lasting effects in terms of child development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| brain development, financial stability for the family during that time, and maternal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| And so we feel like investing in our workforce in that way is going to benefit us in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| And the mayor's, one of his main priorities is jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| And so retention of a talented workforce is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| And so we are now competing with the private sector when it comes to who we hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| And we would like to keep the talent that we already have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| And so being able to offer that as not only a recruitment tool, but a retention tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| and benefit the young families that work for Knox County, they're really the ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| make all of this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| So I won't take any credit for any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I have an amazing team behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| My organizational development director, Marcus Kennedy, did a lot of the work on these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| My HR ops team keeps it running day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| And of course, benefits is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| So I guess I'll entertain questions if there are any, but that's kind of the highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| of our new personnel plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| And really, this is just another thank you to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Stephanie and her entire team, they take such great care of the employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| And you know, two years of work went into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| And I just want to thank you because you you're doing a great job in making Knox County a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| great place to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| You are looking out for the quality of life of our employees, and you really are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| Knox County one of those employers that people want to stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| And so that's really important with as we recruit and retain talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| I do have just one quick follow up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| You did mention that most were participating in the MFLA, but and so anyone that isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1444)|
| 0:24:13| what has just been the reason for not participating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| I couldn't speak to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| I wouldn't want to speak for them if they don't add this, a lot of it will be basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| how it fits into their workforce and their their individual needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| So I would I would probably defer to them to say why they haven't adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Most everybody has that could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| And they it's been well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| It's been I've received numerous phone calls from people that work for us department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Thank you for letting us offer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| And it's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| I didn't let anybody offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| This is the mayor's initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I just was excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| I didn't have to pitch it as much as I thought I would because he called and was interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| in the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| And luckily, we'd already done the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| And so I said, can I get on the books tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| And I was up there and he had supported the initiative because in reality, they can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| 16 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| So women are typically released after six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| If you've had a C-section, it's eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| So we wanted to get them through at least half of that FMLA leave because FMLA is unpaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| And so a lot of times they'll drain their paychecks just with maternity visits before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| they even have the baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| And so then families are financially out and they can be out for that time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| So we just wanted to make sure that they were financially sound and it was a minimal cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| impact compared to the lifelong outcome that we know we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| Well please tell your team thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Commissioner Hill, you recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| I'm very excited about the paid FLMA leave that is now being granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1545)|
| 0:25:54| Did I hear you say most everybody has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Is there a group or department or who hasn't and why would it not be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1558)|
| 0:26:09| Why couldn't it be a across-the-board policy for all of Knox County employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1569)|
| 0:26:18| So it would be if I had my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| I don't have purview over those offices though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Our HR is really just under the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| So if they haven't, there may be things within their department that I'm not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| For a lot of people it's just really the concept of people being out for eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| even though they can be out anyway, is a little hard to handle I guess for some departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| But they can add it really at any time in the future if we've adopted this and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| going well and maybe we're a case study and set the example, then others may follow and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| understand the value of it as a retention and recruitment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| So who doesn't have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Well, they still have the ability, there are offices spread of record I think on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| meeting and then there are some that plan on putting theirs on next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| I know the DA's office wanted to do it, but they do have state workers and as an employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| you have to administer policies the same for all of your employees and because they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| offer it to their state workers, they couldn't offer it to their county workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| So very valid reason, because that would put them into basically an unfair employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| situation where one group is getting benefits that another group's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| And so they really wanted to, but they couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| We kind of have that anyway, though, if we've got some departments offer it and some don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| I mean, I understand the conflict with the state, but outside of the DA's office then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| it is across the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| No, it would be, so the state actually grants our departments the ability to have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1679)|
| 0:28:08| own handbooks and because they have that in the state statute, the electeds basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| have the autonomy to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| So we are one employer, but individually each office has that ability to create their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| handbook, which makes us very unique as an employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| So who does not have it then, besides the DA's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| So far, I think just the DA's office and perhaps the Sheriff's office, but I'm not sure if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| they're planning on adding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Basically our two biggest offices then, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| We have a little over 1,000 of our 2,700s under the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| There's 700-something under the fee and elected offices, and then the Sheriff has about 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Are there any more questions or discussion for Ms. Candler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| Thank you for coming and for the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| This brings us to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Under our rules, those who have signed up to speak on a particular agenda item may speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| We have two people signed up, however, I've been informed that one person has decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| to forego speaking at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| So that brings us to Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| If you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| State your name and county of residence for the record, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Keith Britt, 506 Knowlton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Sidetracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| That is fantastic news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I was not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| The county has leapfrogged the city in terms of maternity benefits, and that is to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| credit, that is to Mayor Jacobs' credit, and I hope there are news organizations watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| this and this becomes abundantly clear in the public view that you guys have stepped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| up to the plate and there are other people that need to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| So well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Keeping on with that, I would like to provide some context about the information that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| Sheriff's Office shared with you last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| He mentioned the 390 unfilled positions within the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| If you look at a starting salary for a corrections officer, you're currently paying them $39,471.56| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Now, some basic math that projects out to them being able to afford in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| they can buy a home for a maximum of about $98,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| I don't know if you've gone shopping lately in Knox County, that's not going to cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So what you are telling those Sheriff's Office's employees is that this is not a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| This is a temporary job training assignment that's going to allow them to get very valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| skills that they're going to take to a private agency or to a federal agency or to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| location, and they are going to get paid much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| You are not telling them that we want you here for your career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| And until that salary jumps up, that's what we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| We're going to have people coming in for two to three years, and then they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| be exiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| I warned the Knoxville Police Department about this exact same concept in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| It happened, and now they are trying to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| We however, at the county level, face a much more dangerous situation because KPD depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1890)|
| 0:31:37| on the county for the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| And that's where the real tipping point that the Sheriff described is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| If we pass certain thresholds of officer to detainee ratios, the feds will step in, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1904)|
| 0:31:53| we may come to a point where we are unable to accept new detainees, or we may be forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| to push them out the door to another facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| And I cannot tell you, and I'm sorry, I'm former military, I almost cussed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| That would be a cluster of a situation for the county if that starts happening, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| are getting very, very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| So I suggest you take action as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| Now I understand that you don't set the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| I know that the mayor does that, and it comes to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| I strongly suggest you work with the mayor to increase the starting salary of a KCSO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| officer to $50,000 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| That's roughly a 25% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Now you're already paying out roughly 30% to 33% of what that would take in overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| on an annual basis anyway, and based on the numbers that Mr. Caldwell presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| last week, you're only looking at anywhere from a two to three cent tax increase to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| I just said tax increase at a county commission meeting, and I know that's a sin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| So please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| But the city has demonstrated that this is something that taxpayers will accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| Taxpayers hate taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| It is just the antithesis of what taxpayers like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| However, that only applies to a situation where tax payments go to a general fund, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| they don't understand what they're paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| When you demonstrate, and this has been documented in academic research and over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| in experiments, most recently with the city's last budget, if you show taxpayers what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| tax increase is going for, they will get on board, and there is nothing that this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| will get on board more for than supporting their law enforcement to making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| if there's a robbery, that somebody's at least going to come and take a report, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| going to be officers that are going to respond to schools when they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| These are the things that are prioritized by taxpayers here, and these are the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| that should be prioritized by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221121-business?start=2050)|
