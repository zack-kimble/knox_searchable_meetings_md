| 2:20:09| then you can vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| But it would give us an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| to hear more from the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| to see if they feel this is a barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| I did not envision the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| seeing this as a barrier because when the tie happened in my race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| it was the suggestion that they made to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| that the regular election should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| be considered the runoff election for that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| But we could not treat it as the runoff election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| because the charter specifically says two candidates move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| on to the regular election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| So it was a proposal made to me by the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| after a primary had already been held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| But they weren't able to move forward with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| because our charter says only two candidates can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| on that regular election ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| So it's been an issue that I've wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| to address since being elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| And I think that it could prevent headaches in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| should this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Seeing no further questions or discussion, all those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| Oh, all those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| Did you want to speak or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| I'm not generally opposed to this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| I just have pause about moving so quickly with the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| I think it requires a lot more dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| So I'm not generally opposed to the policy idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| But the speed with which we go about charter changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| is really important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| And I know you experienced it firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| But putting something before voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| is very delicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| And I think we just need more time to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| I'm open to a workshop to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| Before we go ahead with the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| two lights on council member Parker and then Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8528)|
| 2:22:14| Mr. Frost, if you could help me with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| with some Roberts rules of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| Once you've introduced something to council and it's voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8539)|
| 2:22:25| what are the rules around reintroducing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| Well, I know in terms of a rezoning, you have a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| You have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| Mr. Swanson, on something like this, recall how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| It could be reintroduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| It could be reintroduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| But if it is reintroduced within a year under council's rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8566)|
| 2:22:51| there would have to be at least some change to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| It wouldn't have to be a major change, just some change to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| That's under council's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8577)|
| 2:23:01| Could the change be an update to the fiscal information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| in the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| That doesn't really change the ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8588)|
| 2:23:13| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8593)|
| 2:23:20| Council member Parker, did you have more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| Or do you want me to go to the next person with their light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8607)|
| 2:23:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| Council member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| So I also am not opposed to making a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| I just think we need to elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| We need to look at what the possibilities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| which is what I said a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| What are all of the options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| I do know that Cliff Rogers talked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| at that time in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| But so my question to you, Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Number one, did you have a recent conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| with the current director of the Election Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| Briefly, but mostly just about deadlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| for getting this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| So not about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| So my question is, if you had an election where the top two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| vote-getters tied, let's say you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| two people with 1,000 votes and a third person with 10 votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| all three of them go on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| so that the public can decide that they indeed did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| want the person with 10 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| OK, seeing no further questions, all those in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8674)|

| 2:27:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| Just want to ask, probably Finance Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| are there any financial implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| to moving these dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| Ms. Juneau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| Yes, we would prefer not to move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8884)|
| 2:28:09| And I will defer to Mr. Evans to elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| But it will create somewhat of a hardship on our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8899)|
| 2:28:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8900)|
| 2:28:21| As a practical matter, it does quite a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8901)|
| 2:28:25| that that does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| First off, could it be done on June 30th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| What happens is it puts your back up against the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| in terms of year-end closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| We use, we in finance, use those last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| And sometimes we'll get more, like this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| I think it was from May 17th till right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| And we're doing a soft close on the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| That takes hours and hours and days and days of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| for an entity our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| And we need that time to close it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| And we need that time to now load the new year budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| so that it can go into effect July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| If it were June 30th, what would inevitably happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| and this happens other places, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| we'd be, excuse my expression, dorking around with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| till we're right up against the end of the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| and the start of the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| We wouldn't have it all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| And we'd end up having to, we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| be able to get the budget loaded for the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| And there'd be like a two-year blackout period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| that happens a lot of places, a two-week blackout period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| where departments can't buy what they need to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8978)|
| 2:29:42| and do what they need to do, because it's not loaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8982)|
| 2:29:46| It also turns into a, I mean, we'd pay payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| It also jams you up in terms of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| The audits were here for a couple weeks this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| and doing their sampling and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| And when we closed out that FY, and we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| once we're able to do that properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| that saves us a lot of time in getting ready for the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| itself, because you've got to have the balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| sheet and the income statement done for each one of your funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| And we've got 150-something funds with multiple accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| We have to get all that squared away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| before you can even provide that to the auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| While being able to do that soft close for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| and close out helps you be in better shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| to deal with the auditors when they get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| This would, again, it would put our back against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| And as you know, we've got, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| had a lot of retirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| We've got an inexperienced staff relative to the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| it was, I'll say, six, seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| And this, as a practical matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| this would be a very problematic thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| We need that time in the month of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| We need that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9065)|
| 2:31:12| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| So I introduced this agenda item to give city council more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9076)|
| 2:31:22| during the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| And in our web forum, I included a sample budget calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| to give you all an idea of what I was hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| Now, that sample calendar, it requires the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9096)|
| 2:31:44| of us not passing the budget on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| So we're still back up against that tight timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| with public hearings coming after first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| So now it's even more important that we are able to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| the date to June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9118)|
| 2:32:03| What my calendar proposes is that we start earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| with reviewing the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| I would actually, I feel like we would have a better process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| if the budget were released a bit earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| earlier in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| And then we had some sort of budget workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| for city council following the release of that budget that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| would, in many ways, mirror the public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9151)|
| 2:32:38| The public hearings is when we get the detailed information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9158)|
| 2:32:44| Often, Savannah is the one who prepares that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| And it tells us exactly what's in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| And we know, coming from the mayor's budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| what has been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| And then the public hearings are when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| we get the updates on what was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| and what actually made it into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| The current schedule that we've been working under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9185)|
| 2:33:12| we have public hearings usually a few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9192)|
| 2:33:19| before we have the final vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| So this year, we had public hearings on Thursday or Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| And then our vote on the budget was on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| For me, that is not enough time to review the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9213)|
| 2:33:39| and consider and be able to propose and discuss amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| to the budget, which should be authority that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9223)|
| 2:33:49| have as defined by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| And so if we have this authority by charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| but based on the history of amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| that have come from city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| it seems like our timeline has potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| prevented council members from engaging in the budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| process in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| There's just very limited time to discuss amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| and bring those forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| We've experienced in the past, and I honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| can't remember if this was when I was on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| or before I joined council, but depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| on when our June meetings take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9270)|
| 2:34:36| can make it very difficult for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| to meet that June 15 deadline and actually move us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| much earlier in, I mean, this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| we finalized the budget by May 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| It really was with us for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| I really don't think that that is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| I don't feel like we're able to fully carry out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9297)|
| 2:35:04| our role sufficiently with a two-week review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| process of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| And so moving it to June 30 does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| mean we would pass the budget on June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| It means if we need an additional meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| to review the budget, for instance, this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| we would have had our June 14 meeting to also review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9323)|
| 2:35:28| That's actually before the 15th, but what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| if that were the 16th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| Each year, our meetings hit on a different date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| and it could be off in June by one or two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| And that prevents us from having another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9342)|
| 2:35:47| to discuss and consider amendments to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| So that was the reasoning behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| It does not require us to pass the budget on June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| It gives that as the final date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| Similar to the state process, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| has until end of August to submit the budget to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| but often works to submit it early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| because there are incentives that are provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| for submitting it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| And so I imagine we would have a similar process where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| the goal is to carry out a process as efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9384)|
| 2:36:28| as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9388)|
| 2:36:29| But if we have a year where there's a proposed tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| increase or we're experiencing a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| and there are lots of federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| to track and understand, then taking an additional two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9398)|
| 2:36:44| to have further discussion would be possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| under this amendment, giving us until June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| And so that was my reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| I also realize we have invested recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9414)|
| 2:37:01| in new financial management software for the finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| department to help improve the development of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9426)|
| 2:37:12| and that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| And my hope was that this could be a benefit to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9434)|
| 2:37:20| for making that investment, not only a benefit for city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| council, but a benefit for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| so that we can actually develop a more robust public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9446)|
| 2:37:32| during the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| And so this is my modest proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| just to give us a little bit more time if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| Every year, there's not going to necessarily be a need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| but there may be some years where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| we need a little bit more time, especially when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| talking about tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| And this would give us that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| Thank you, Council Member Riders and Council Member Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| Ms. Parker, I appreciate what you're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| However, I mean, our second vote was in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| We could have made a motion to postpone that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| And if colleagues agreed to it, we could have postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| So there is some additional time often when we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| But I'm not going to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9505)|
| 2:38:29| because my concern is year end for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9509)|
| 2:38:36| And also, I think maybe there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| ways that we can look at doing our calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| without having to put a charter amendment on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9524)|
| 2:38:49| to improve our timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| Council, no, I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9534)|
| 2:38:57| So seeing no further discussion, all those in favor, please say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=9541)|
