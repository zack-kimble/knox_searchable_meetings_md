| 0:09:35| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Would it be possible when we have appointments with individual districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| or individual names that we separate those out individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| So that we can go ahead and approve the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Are you wanting them to actually be listed as separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| No, it's just a comment or a question for in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| I'm not necessarily requesting it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| I'm just asking in the future, could we separate those out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| so that they're not lumped together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=607)|

| 0:10:34| Commissioner Moyers, is there any issue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| I appreciate that recommendation and seeing no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| we will change that in the future to have districts listed separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=643)|

| 0:11:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| I had pulled this just asking for Director Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| to just give a very brief overview of what's going to be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| We have a lot of people that have been waiting a long time for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I'd be glad to, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Yeah, this project that the state representative got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| in the governor's budget last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| so we have a grant in an amount of $2.3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| to widen both West Emory Road and Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| There'll be turn lanes from where Carnes Valley comes in on the west end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| all the way to Copper Ridge on the east end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| There'll be a right and a left turn lane also on the stem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| or Beaver Ridge Road, a fully actuated traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| That project obviously is going to take some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| so one of the things that I've talked to the Chairlady about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| we've identified some additional right-of-way in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| that was donated by Smithfield on their new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| and we will be installing a temporary signal in the coming weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| It won't be the final improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| but it will reduce a lot of congestion through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| especially for that eastbound traffic in the morning and afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| so be on the lookout for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| and obviously we'll process this project forward as quickly as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| through the state process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=775)|

| 0:14:57| Is this the same dollar amount as the last contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| The individual dollar amounts have changed just a little bit based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| population, but the total, the $605,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| that is the same as it was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| But Karn's, the population grew a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| so their contract went up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| It was my understanding that at least what I was told a couple months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| that no additional money was going to be going to the rescue squad until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| state comptroller's report was finalized or in some shape and form in which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| could review to make sure that county money was being appropriately used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| So how did that change so quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| So what we are doing right now, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| is what we have reimbursed for them so far for FY23 is $146,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| So they still have $150,000 remaining on their FY23 contract and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| holding that until the comptroller's investigation is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| We've done a departmental audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| We feel like that there's about $13,000 in fraud that we may have paid in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| So we're holding the rest of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| That being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| the person that perpetrated the fraud is no longer with the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| They now have an outside accounting firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| They reported it to us immediately the day they found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| They have done everything we have asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| They've been really good partners in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| We feel like there's no opportunity at this point with this new funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| there to be any problems at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| But we are still holding what's remaining on the FY23 contract until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| comptroller's report is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1011)|

| 0:16:55| Thank you, Madam Chair, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Do you have any indication from the comptroller of the treasury when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| they're going to wrap up their report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| I mean, we've been hearing in about two or three weeks for a while now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| I think they're pretty busy right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| but I can't imagine that it will be much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| It should be any day now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1034)|

| 0:19:06| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| I put this on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| It recently came to my attention when assisting some of my constituents who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| had a cell phone tower application in their community and reviewing our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| current ordinance that there were a few what we consider fundamental flaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| So in working with Assistant Law Director Mike Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| some of the members of BZA, and some members of planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| we just feel like this needs a good going over, as they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| We discovered that in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| it's absent of a public notification requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| But what it does include is an appeal deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| So as you can imagine, that's contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| So we want to take a good look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| We also found that before 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| all cell phone applications were a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| Now they're broken into levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| We would definitely like to see these go back to a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| And so in just working with them, that's what I would ask for support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| We just want to get Planning Commission to take a good look at this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| provide us with some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Commissioner Frazier, in your discussions with the county departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| are we going to look at what the town of Farragut has in place for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| wireless standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Because a lot of our county land obviously adjoins the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| and they've got a very extensive policy that they worked on for quite a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| we have a copy of that policy was provided to us by Vice Mayor Paul Flynn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| and we are going to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| Seeing no other lights, we have a proper motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1264)|

| 0:21:30| Would you like to make a motion before discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1290)|

| 0:21:38| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Second by Daly, with Daly requesting to be a sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| To be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Commissioner Lee, I see you had your light on first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| and I will certainly honor that, followed by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| You had asked to have it pulled, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| That was why I had put you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Is that incorrect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Well, you don't have to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| I had some concerns about the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| After speaking with the law director and his recommendation that we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| out certain language, if Mr. Moyers will address that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| In the body of the resolution, second paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| there's language originally that was very directive in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| It would have prohibited certain county employees or funds to be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| certain programs, activities, events, or institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| The language of that is extremely broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| It is of a wide, how do I put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| It has a lot of room within these terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| To make it county policy, we felt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| would really require some definition in these terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| It wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| We think that it presented some substantial legal problems for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| We think that the entire resolution is really more a sense of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| commission resolution rather than one that's designed to direct policy in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| We felt it was important to continue that in that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| The language that we suggested to be changed was take out the part that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| directed that the mayor and other employees of the county do certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| things or not do certain things and make it more expressing the beliefs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| and opinions of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| That's why we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Is there anyone else that would like to speak to this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Forgive me, Commissioner Schoonmaker, for taking that liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| I was just going to say, when I read the resolution on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| I just contacted the director of Knox County Finance to see what kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| issues that that would place on Knox County's finances because I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| concerned the way it was written originally that that could tie our hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| in numerous ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| So now the resolution has been altered to have that taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| So I think we can have an opportunity to decide on next Monday night what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| I just have a question for the sponsor of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Commissioner Lee, I guess you authored this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| Maybe you can just explain further, like, what is the problem you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| trying to solve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| Help me understand, what does this help solve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| Well, Commissioner Jay, I can't say that it solves a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| but it is taking a position of protecting the innocence of our children is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| what the whole resolution is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| I'm just trying to, like, is there a list of activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Is there a list of events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| It's just such a broad statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| It's like everybody, of course, everybody wants to protect children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| but it's kind of like a resolution saying, like, we don't like crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| I mean, what does it specifically do to help Knox County as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| legislative action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| And that's what I'm trying to, I'm struggling to see what it will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| other than just being a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| And maybe it is just a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| It's not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| It is a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| There's a lot of programs to fight crime, protect from crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| It doesn't necessarily do anything to change the crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| but this makes a statement that Knox County is being diligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| and conscientious to protect our children from sexual violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| from all the things listed in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Now, you're saying a list of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| That is not defined in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| This is just a resolution saying that we are committed to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| I did have one question about one of the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| I think it's on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| It seems to be a, I don't know the exact wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| but like an interpretive statement where it says encourages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| activities, which are wholesome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| good and honorable content and activities should be promoted by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| but by whose standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| I mean, that's, it's just above the, the, be it resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| wholesome, good and honorable content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| But again, so it's so vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| like your definition of that may be different than mine and different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| than commissioner Durant and commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| How is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| how can it be so vague and not be everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1650)|
| 0:27:41| I guess I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I'm just a little bit confused on what you're asking because this is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| list of what activities are allowed and what they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| It is basically just no different than when Nancy Reagan declared the war| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| on drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| It is saying we are dedicated to the innocence of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| There's not a list of activities we're prohibiting or endorsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| It's just saying that we as a whole want to protect our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| And my last question is I looked up the language in this and found similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| resolutions in a couple of other places around the County that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| introduced it or adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| I found one in Jamestown town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| Both of these were in Michigan Jamestown Township.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| They first introduced something similarly to this and then use that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| stepping stone to defund and close libraries because of content that didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| approve of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| And then at Olive Township,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| also in Michigan they introduced very similar resolution almost word for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| word and then use that to begin limiting efforts to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| what the health department could and couldn't participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| So in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| is your intention to introduce this and then begin to look at health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| department libraries or any other Knox County and entity and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| does it restart restricting or finding ways to focus on content or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| you know, what is this the precursor of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| That is not the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| And I would like to say that Sumner County recently did pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| the original resolution that I presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Sumner County in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| I went on as a co-sponsor here because I've had the opportunity to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| to juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Didn't want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| And go down to juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| You can't go into the judge's chambers unless you're part of the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| case itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| And I'm sitting here today right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| The youngsters are not being protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| The criminals are being protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| And that's the honest truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| It's sad that the laws are written, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| to protect the criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| It's not to protect the innocent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| And I've seen that firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| Are there any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Seeing none, we have a proper motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1828)|

| 0:30:57| That is a nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| Nine aye, one pass, one absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1862)|

| 0:31:25| or any other elected office without taking a leave of absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you. Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1892)|

| 0:31:43| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I just wanted to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I wanted to ask the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| is this to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| by the resolution, the body of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| to bring things into...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| what is the word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Compliance with the Hatch Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Well, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| Until 2012, it was illegal for any employee of any entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| that received any federal funding to run for partisan office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| In 2012, that was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| And now, so long as your position is not fully funded with federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| you can run for partisan office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| So, before 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| this requirement that they take a leave of absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| would have been a requirement under federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| It now is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Now it's more a policy question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| So, we're not required to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| but since the change is in 2012, you can change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| so it's more permissive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Mr. Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| this is for all offices, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| They can participate in...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| You're talking about all officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| All elected offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Yes, it would allow anybody in the classified service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| to run for political office, sheriff, or any other office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| without having to take a leave of absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| They still could not do things like wear their uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| there's a lot of things they still can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| but they could run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I was looking to see if there's anyone from the Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| that might want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I don't see anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| Ms. Taylor, do you have any comments about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2030)|

| 0:33:54| Seeing no other lights, we have a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2037)|

| 0:34:44| Yeah, just interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2084)|

| 0:39:05| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Number 57, it's in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| I noticed something it said on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| that was accepted by Knox Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| that that property is serviced by the Clinton Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| I can't speak as a District 6 Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| to that specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| I don't believe that we have Ms. Brooks here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| but that will certainly be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| for clarification next week unless someone else would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| Did you have other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Well, I think I will reserve those then for next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| because we have six out of the nine items are on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| their consent agenda, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| I think I'm good for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| One of mine, which is two items, but it's one, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| It's a sector plan to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| It's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| What was that number, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| It's 51 and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Very small piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| I have no issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| I've heard no comments or complaints from anyone on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| Number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| I do have a few questions on number 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| and I would just encourage you to reach out to Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| I believe he's representing the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| if you have any questions on 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| I would like to also make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| I would like to also make a comment on item 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| I will note for you that that is in a FEMA floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| and if you could go out and take a look at the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| perhaps before we vote next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| that might be very helpful if you determine your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| In reference to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| also if commissioners will look at the RAE zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| which probably hasn't been used for 40 years in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| but it was set aside for large parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| with larger setback requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2506)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I've got one, which is number 58,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| and I deferred that from last month to this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I have still not heard from the builder or the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| Last time I spoke with Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| we really don't have a number of what he's looking for on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| and so I don't really know what to do with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| until we hear something, what he's wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| I've just put my light on to get to the EMS thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| so I'm just kind of placeholding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I'm not zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| To answer Commissioner Frazier's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| I think he has to show up at this next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| He's already had his first chance of not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Second chance, this would actually be the third chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| if you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| So you say you have not talked to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| Spoken with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| No, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| I have called him twice and also sent him two emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| so I'm kind of in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| We do have some public comments on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| Chert Pit is a rough road, as it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| so it's just not a great area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| And then for you to not tell me what number you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| it's kind of hard to go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| I guess we'll see if the applicant shows up Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Item 54, Kipton Station Road, is about 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2614)|
| 0:43:42| and they got approved for five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| It might be a little high for that unit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| so it's next to the high school, then over to the right of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| You've got, I think, four units to the acre across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| It's five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| If you start getting any calls or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| you may want to drive out there and take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| but it's right next to the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| They probably put a sidewalk from the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| the new subdivision, straight to the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| You got a question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| Yeah, so this is 100-plus homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| No, and I think I was told today by one of the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| homeowners there, and it's going to be 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| 72 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| On 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| On 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| But they're asking for 100 sites, according to the filing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| I've got a meeting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| I think the site plan, I was told, only has 72 homes on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| so that'll actually come down to 3.7 there about per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| is all that'll come down to, which is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| It doesn't matter if it's 100 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| You're only going to get so many on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| you know, on 20 acres, as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| We just got to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| I've got to be careful on the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| because it's happened to all of us in our districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| that we set a number, and three years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| property's sold, and that number is set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| and instead of being a single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| it could be something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| so that's the main concern about setting the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| And if you start getting calls about anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| you might want to drive out and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| It's a good piece of property for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Still holding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| I'm on the next topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Oh, I haven't forgotten, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Okay, I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| This button doesn't work, so I just kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I have your item down, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Just a little bit of general information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| I had just a question from a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| asking why are we seeing so many RA versus PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| and I just wanted to, you know, explain a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| These are smaller lots in areas with lower population densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| and usually there's one dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| and sometimes the dwelling is out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| and so they're looking for a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| to just get that building modification up in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| so that they can modify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| So just a little information to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Any other zoning discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| I apologize, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| I did not do a good job on that discussion of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| I will have that a little more orderly next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| The next item was added to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| discussion regarding the ambulance RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you, and this was a request of Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you very much, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| If I could ask Mr. Vendavate, Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| and also we have with us the EMA director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| public safety director, and a lot of folks here from the EOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| that was activated last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| lots of folks just want to recognize them and say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| Colin is here, and mostly just want to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| for all of your hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| but also wanted to ask you about sort of where are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| in the ambulance contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| We have an RFP, and a lot of constituents have just asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| sort of what's the update on where we are, where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| what's the process, and I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| they're interested in learning how do we do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| because it only comes up once every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| We're very pleased that we received four proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| We are beginning the evaluation of those probably in the next day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| Obviously hard to work with schedules, so we will do this as expeditiously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| but as thoroughly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| We will give this RFP and evaluation our utmost attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| like we would for any RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| although we understand this has some different ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| through all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| So we are in the evaluation phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| It is still what we'll call a dead phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Timeline, we still hope to have this on October's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| That's the goal, and hopefully if we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| the committee really works hard and does their job and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| then we'll be ready to go for you in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| I just thought I'd bring it up to give a general information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| but also if anybody else has any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| I know Dwight's been working hard at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Mr. VandeVeet, I know I came in with like 1,000 questions last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| and I appreciate that you and health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| and everybody sat down and went through everything in the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| and a bunch of other questions about general health and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| and how we work with hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| and how we work with ambulance contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| and what affects KFD and everything in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| So I don't know if you have anything else to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| You're very welcome, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| We appreciate the questions and the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Just for the benefit of the chair and the body as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| we have asked Fitch and Associates to send a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| to the October commission meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| They won't speak to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| They were the upstream consulting firm that did a system-wide overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| but their work really informed the RFP that was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| And I'll just echo what Matt said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| For us to get, in the current environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| for us to get four viable proposals really speaks volumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| about the quality of work Fitch did for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| and the quality of work that procurement did putting the RFP together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| I don't know how many hours of our lives Kevin Parton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| and I have spent talking about this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| but our biggest concern was that Jay Garrison would open the box on the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| and question it would be empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| So for, again, we have four proposals, all good and viable companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| and that is really what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| So excited about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| and I can't say enough about the work that Kevin Parton, Steve Hamby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| and Jay Garrison and Matt Myers have done in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| It's just been exceptional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Since the last contract was ten years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| how many times have we had to activate the emergency center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| because of no ambulance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| So what I would like to do, if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| is just let's talk in the context of the current contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| and then if there were any other questions about the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| I would defer those to Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| because we try to observe a bright, clear line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| in the solicitation and bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| So backing up to your question, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| EOC activation is not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| I do think this is the first time that I can recall it being activated due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| criticality of ambulance availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| There was some discussion when it happened that it had never historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| been activated for anything other than severe weather event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| That's actually not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| It's been activated numerous times over the year for everything from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| exercises to hazmat events on the interstate to train derailments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| In this particular case, the fire service providers from both rural metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| and KFD obviously saw in the system that there were a limited number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| ambulances available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| They saw an exceptionally high number of hospital holds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| which is just a system problem that we are struggling with like many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| communities and continue to struggle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| And they saw that they had numerous engines waiting at incident scenes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| ambulances that were obviously held up at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| The decision was made to activate the EOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Mr. Ickes stood it up and did an exceptional job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| It was about a three-hour activation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| I just would recognize, gosh, a number of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Our own public safety director, Brent Seymour, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Colin did exceptional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| Captain Robbie Nix from rural metro is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| Assistant Chief Mark Wilbanks from KFD was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| Also sitting in the middle of it under an extraordinary amount of pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| was Anastasia Huddleston, who is a communications supervisor for GMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| Anastasia is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Give us a wave, Anastasia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| So she is sitting in the center of the room with Captain Nix on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| and Chief Wilbanks on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Steve Hamby, who also works for us, did exceptionally good work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| and all of those folks are throwing questions and requests for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| and things like that, and she is managing assets capably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| We just couldn't be more pleased with how it went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| In a perfect world, it won't ever happen again, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Commissioner Durack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| I just wanted to reiterate the appreciation for those who did support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| Emergency Operations Center, the staff, Director Ickes, Director Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| Thank you all for doing that, and as Mr. VandeVeet said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| hopefully that was one and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3210)|
| 0:53:38| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3218)|

| 0:53:46| We really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| Is there any other business to come before this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| Madam Chair, I do have an announcement, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3235)|

| 0:53:58| I just wanted to let all my colleagues know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| and you might want to let your constituents know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| especially if you are a West Knox County Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| that the clerk's office in the Farragut location is now closed until further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| notice as they are making extensive renovations to the Farragut Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| So you might want to send those folks to the Cedar Bluff location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| We are actively looking for another space to both expand our services in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3260)|

| 0:54:34| Just as a general warning to all the commissioners and constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| listening, there's been a new rash of text scams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| phishing, malicious activity going out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| that somehow we've gotten sort of everybody's cell phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| And so just be aware if there's anybody asking you to click on anything in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| text message, there's apparently a whole other wave of, it's not just email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| they've got everybody's cell phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| And I can imagine a lot of people would be, it says something like, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| your package wasn't delivered and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3307)|

| 0:55:26| I'm not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| Before I adjourn, I want to remind everyone that it only takes 32 muscles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| to smile and 70 to frown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230918?start=3337)|
