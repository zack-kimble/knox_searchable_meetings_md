| 2:13:28| Okay, okay, well then maybe it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| But anyway, we probably need to keep that in consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| if we feel like it's important for our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| to be over in Nashville on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8015)|

| 2:13:54| that if you know somebody that'll be a good fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8034)|

| 2:16:22| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8184)|
| 2:16:24| Is Dr. Ryswick still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8184)|
| 2:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| Can we skip this one and come back to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| Do, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| Where there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| Can I make a motion that we skip this one until Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| He's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| Saved by the bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8206)|
| 2:16:54| Dr. Ryswick, we're discussing policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| one, I-340, Promotion, Retention, Acceleration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| I know we've discussed this at policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| and we also had this on our work session last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| I know I've had some questions in the interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| and I've spoken to Mr. Myers and also to yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| and just would like a little bit of explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| about the impact of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| One, that explanation about why this is being added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| relative to the law that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| And also any explanation about the potential impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| and or deficiencies in this relative to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| with special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| So this is actually a law that was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| that goes into effect for 22-23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| So we're a year ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| So it won't be this current year's third graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| but it would be for next year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| And we felt like just as a staff and I think as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| that it's good to kind of give families that lead time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| knowing they may have to make some decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| going into that so they're not surprised next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| So basically the law that was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| requires any student who does not score proficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| on the English language arts portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| of their TCAP in third grade to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| The state has a few allowances for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| First would be students who have not received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| two years of English language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8299)|
| 2:18:20| If they're ELL students and have not received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| that intervention for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| it would not apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| But then there are three options for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| who don't score proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8309)|
| 2:18:30| One would be to retake and show proficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8310)|
| 2:18:34| prior to the start of their fourth grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| We're assuming that would be through a state test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| We currently don't have as much guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| on how that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| Again, the state has some time to get that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| The second would be to attend the summer learning camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| which are six week camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| We ran those last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| We'll run those again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| And so students could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| But while they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| they have to have a 90% attendance rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| and then they have to take a post-test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| to show proficiency there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| And then the third option for students would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| they could go on to fourth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| but they would have a Tennessee All Corps tutor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| assigned to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| And again, we don't know quite all the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| of that, how many hours a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| or those sorts of things that would be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| but they would have that tutor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| And then at the end of the fourth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| if they were still not proficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| they would be retained then in fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| So that's just for overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| Our understanding right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| I'm talking to Mr. Myers as he's talked to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| in the State Department to get guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| is that applies to all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| That would include students with 504s or IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| So our understanding, again, I say right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| because we know lots of times laws can change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| and things can happen over the course of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| before they're put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| But our understanding right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| the function of the IEP team or the 504 team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| would be to obviously continue those interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| prior to a student taking those tests in third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| But if it does come that they're not proficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| that they would be part of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| around the interventions that would happen for that child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| trying to get them proficient by the end of the fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| I would also say this, I have Ms. Flynn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| Michelle Flynn here from one of the supervisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| in our student support program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| and I'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| if there are further questions around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Yes, Ms. Flynn, would you mind speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| any potential negative impacts on students with IEPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| and 504s relative to this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| that's being dictated by law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| As far as a negative impact, I mean, I think that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| I support what-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| Would you mind pulling the mic a little closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8439)|
| 2:20:40| Sure, I support what Dr. Roswick stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| as far as the IEP teams would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| and we would look at, through the IEP team process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| any adjustments that may need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| for those students that were prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| even the retention decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| that were considered to be at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| for potential impact of that retention as a third grader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| and make some adjustments as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| As far as the potential negative effects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| I think our students with IEPs or 504s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| the same research-based information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| that is out there for retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| just for students in general would apply to them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| Are you, I didn't ask you to be prepared with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| but can you speak to any of that research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| from your understanding or would you not be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| Not off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| So I appreciate the clarifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| and I just wanna make sure that the public understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| that the reason why this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| is being recommended to be changed right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| is because of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| I know for myself, in my vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| whether or not I vote to approve or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| is not reflective of my belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| in the practice of retention or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| but that this is a law that's been handed down by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| So any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8524)|

| 2:33:09| We have three people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| First, we have Rachel Hudson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| Rachel Hudson, you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| Please state your name and county you're resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9197)|
| 2:33:24| My name is Rachel Hudson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| And I am a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| As I said, my name is Rachel Hudson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9210)|
| 2:33:31| And I taught Knox County schools for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| The majority of those years were spent teaching alongside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| and under the mentorship of Brandy Self at Moreland Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| Brandy was one of the strongest advocates for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| She believed that every child deserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| a champion, an adult who would never give up on him or her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| and who understood the power of connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| and insisted they become the best they could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| In order to champion children, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| need to champion the adults who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| most influential in their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| And that encompasses coming alongside families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| But within the school system, it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| coming alongside teachers and administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| The mission of public schools is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| equitable, quality, and free education for all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| regardless of the zip code in which they are born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| Do our actions, decisions, postures, and values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| support that mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| And are we supporting those who live out that mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| every day in the classrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9264)|
| 2:34:26| During the last few school board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| there's been a lot of discussion about learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| And it grieves me that there continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| to be a gross misunderstanding that missing instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| is the same as missing assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| This reveals a deep lack of appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| for the work of our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9279)|
| 2:34:40| You can't replace the impact of a teacher's relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| and quality instruction with an assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| And teachers show up again and again and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| because they are there to serve children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| However, teachers in our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| are realizing that what they're being asked to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| is no longer serving children, nor is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| in the best interest of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| Now, dedicated teachers can no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9299)|
| 2:35:00| continue within this profession, even though they love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| Self-care and boundaries require necessity, community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| and systemic care, which has been lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| Our children have a lot of ground to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| And our teachers are our biggest asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| in repairing the learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| So we need to help and not hinder them in that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| So we call on you to do the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| Hire a superintendent with extensive teaching experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| and understanding of the challenges of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| Second, give teachers actual planning work days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| on their professional development days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| instead of more meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| Third, use a snow day to give teachers a day off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| When Brandy died, Moreland Heights experienced a major loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| and they deserved a bereavement day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| They deserve that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| Fourth, meet with a small group of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| to listen to their experiences and insights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| listen to their hearts and stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| without a political decision already being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| Fifth, increase TA and custodial pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| They are crucial to the functioning of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| and they don't make a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| Sixth, hire more professional support staff, counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| social workers, OTs, PTs, speech teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| help heal our children and enable them to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| Seventh, allow and emphasize the space and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| for emotional and social learning as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| Lastly, defend your teachers, advocate for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| and speak up for increased funding for public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9376)|
| 2:36:19| so that all students can be served well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| Our teachers and students deserve a united community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| that supports them because it's too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| on their shoulders to do it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| If we are continually putting our kids and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| in a political game, then we've already lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| Our children need teachers-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| Thank you, Ms. Rachel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| And our teachers need your actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| Next, we'll have Sarah Grace Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| Sarah Grace Mills, if you could say your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| count your residents and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| Hi, I'm Sarah Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9404)|
| 2:36:45| I'm a former teacher at Moreland Heights Elementary as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| And I appreciate the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| to speak to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| I hope my perspective will help you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| why good teachers are leaving the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| How many of you in this room are parents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| How many of you in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| have experienced tragedy as a parent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| And how difficult was it for you to care for your children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| as you process that grief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| I'm imagining that you took off work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| I would hope that your employer encouraged you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| to prioritize yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| so that you could prioritize your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| When Moreland Heights Principal Brandy Self died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| teachers were given 10 minutes to process the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| Then they were asked to teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9444)|
| 2:37:25| They were given no days off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| They were given a paragraph to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| if students asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| You all canceled school to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| how to deal with the mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9452)|
| 2:37:34| I think you could have canceled school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| if you had a mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| I think you could have canceled school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| for a tragedy like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| I will not draw a direct comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| between parenthood and teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| but I will tell you that children are acutely aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| of adults who are not being cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9468)|
| 2:37:51| In my four years at Moreland Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| I served on the leadership team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| became a demonstration reading ELA teacher for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| hosted student interns from local colleges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| and was consistently scored fours and fives on evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| I can honestly say I was not the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| Knox County wanted to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| When I quit teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| I did not quit because I didn't want to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| as is the common narrative right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| I quit because I worked too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| I developed a stomach ulcer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| recurrent quarter-sized mouth ulcers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| and horrific chronic insomnia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| I spent thousands of dollars at specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| all to determine that it was stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| I couldn't use this time to tell you how and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| the specific stress I experienced in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| but I don't believe that's the best use of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| The best use of your time is to do the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| I would encourage you to consider the following suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| Require a minimum number of second and third year teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| on the Superintendent Teacher Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9526)|
| 2:38:50| or develop a new teacher council to get feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| from your youngest teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| who you really can't afford to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| Each of you need time in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| I know that some of you had it, and I'm thankful for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| but this is a different time for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| Consider subbing five days a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| and write those subplans yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| Consider shadowing a teacher for five days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9547)|
| 2:39:11| Spend time with the students that you are trying to champion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| but spend the time in the shoes of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| who champion them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| I believe the school board has a desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| to champion students, but I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| there's a growing divide between you and the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| Your teachers are on the ground giving hugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| handing out ice packs, wiping tears, cracking jokes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| worrying at night, and teaching reading and math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| Walk in their shoes, be their champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| This is what our principal, Brandi Self, did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| and this is what I'm asking you to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| Thank you, next we have Kaitlyn Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| Kaitlyn Jones, you have three minutes to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| and if you could state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9588)|
| 2:39:53| Hi, my name's Kaitlyn Jones, and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9593)|
| 2:39:57| I first wanted to show my appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| to the board members here, board member Henderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| and everyone else who voted for the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| related to masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| I believe I speak for not only myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| but several parents across Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9607)|
| 2:40:08| when I say we see that you're listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| and attempting to do something to help in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| with the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9613)|
| 2:40:14| I also wanted to say thank you to board member McMillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| for asking to have the graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| regarding the superintendent search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9618)|
| 2:40:19| to include more details with the explanations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| and the processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| This last year has been extremely an eye-opening experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| and I have realized I need to be paying closer attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| to my son's education and the processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| in which he receives it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| Something that is frustrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| is the lack of access to information on the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| which is keeping our kids in masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| For me, having a transparent open line of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| regarding where we are in the process of the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9642)|
| 2:40:43| I find it difficult to find the potential court date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| and there hasn't really been any new information given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| While I understand that there may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| anything new happening, even an email saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9649)|
| 2:40:52| that there's nothing happening would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| I also wanted to speak briefly on the transfer policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| It is difficult to find the proper procedures to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| when moving to a different school zone mid-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| Alec and I moved two miles and changed his assigned school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| from A.L. Watts to a school on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| I thought I wouldn't have to apply for a transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| to keep him at A.L. Watts until the following school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9669)|
| 2:41:12| however, that is apparently not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| I reached out to the transfer office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| who told me it was up to the school principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| but unfortunately, due to issues with the mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| my relationship with the principal was harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| I have sent several requests for approval for him to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| and have not received an answer in weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| on if Alec will be forced to transfer to a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| next semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| Due to Alec's disabilities, it would be detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| to move him to a new school right in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| This would mean that he would have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| all new therapists, teachers, TAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9700)|
| 2:41:41| case managers, students, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| I feel as though there should be some process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| that a child with a special needs in a situation like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| would be able to apply for a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| and have it answered in a reasonable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| As of today, I still have not had an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| from Alec's principal on if he'll be forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| out of A.L. Lawson to a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| And no transfer IEP meeting has been set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| as a result of no approval or denial being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9721)|
| 2:42:04| even though that would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| Also, with regards to the superintendent search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| I think it's important to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| that special needs community, and I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| for you all to keep that in mind when looking for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| I guess you could say that the theme of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| was asking for continued communication and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| I appreciate those of you who have tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| bettering communication between the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| and the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9745)|
| 2:42:26| We see those of you that are making an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| and listening to parents' concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| and we look forward to continue working with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| in the future years, and hope to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| communication even farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9758)|
| 2:42:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| So we had a request for board forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| Mr. Chin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9768)|
| 2:42:49| So this is honestly kind of briefly touched on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| in the public forum as well, but as a student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| teachers are really our next line of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| who provide education that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| And having talked to some teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| at least one, I've heard about perhaps undercurrents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| within Knox County schools about teacher dissatisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| within this county and who might lead to issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| down the line next year or in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| And so I was just wondering if the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| has had any communication regarding that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| and if so, if there are any plans to perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| remedy those issues in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9805)|
| 2:43:32| So can you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| Yeah, so basically seeing as there seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| large amounts of dissatisfaction within teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9818)|
| 2:43:42| in Knox County schools, have board members heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| from teachers regarding that dissatisfaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| And if so, are there any plans to perhaps remedy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| for the following school years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| Did you report for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9836)|
| 2:44:01| Address that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9841)|
| 2:44:02| Well, I mean, we could individually address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| I mean, I can tell you, other than phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| from a few that I know personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9848)|
| 2:44:14| that's all I've received, and it's a handful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| since the beginning of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| I think it's been an on-call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9863)|
| 2:44:29| I would like to thank Ms. Coatney and Mr. Dupler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| for working with me on the policies that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9871)|
| 2:44:35| I told you last time that I would group those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| so that we could get through it more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| And once we got that done, looking at how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| the record keeping was gonna be for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| was gonna make it more difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| significantly more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| And so it made more sense to go straight through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| But in the future, it may be easier to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| So we had a practice session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| and we'll look at that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9900)|

| 2:45:07| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| Sorry, Ms. Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=9909)|
