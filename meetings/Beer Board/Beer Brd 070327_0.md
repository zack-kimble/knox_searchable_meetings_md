| 0:00:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=42)|

| 0:00:55| record that I have to miss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=55)|

| 0:01:02| Board Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=62)|

| 0:01:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| We may be postponing that because our attorney out of the law department is unable to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| it and it's very important that she be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=68)|

| 0:06:56| windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| They said that was the illegal and refusing a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| I'm not real clear on that one because I was never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| told that there was a beer inspector outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| I was relaying messages from behind the counter to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| the people outside telling them I was going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| and unlock the door and they said that was refusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| a beer inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| But we were closed for a private party and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| rules that I read at the ice class that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| given me said that you didn't have to have a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| inspection unless it was during operating hours and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| then again I was never told there was actually a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| inspector outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| So this is to come before a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| They charged me with it and I went to court and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| convicted me of it and I appealed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| So it goes back to court I think in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| It's reset for May for me to appeal the sign charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and refusing the beer inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| There was one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Was this at the Lonest Drive location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Yes ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=487)|
| 0:08:07| Where you were previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| And now this request is for Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Thank you Mr. Swanson and reviewing the applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| record there's an issue of a found being found guilty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| for sale to an underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Does the city ordinances address what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| Section 4-37 of the city code says no permittee shall be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| person who has been convicted of any violation of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| ordinance related to the possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| sale, manufacture, or transportation of beer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| sale, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| beverages or beer or any crime involving moral turpitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| This is a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| The sale to underage is a conviction that has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| the sale of beer and it does fall within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| So even if the Beer Board wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| we could not legally grant a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Under the code, she's not eligible until 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| I had to come in front of the Beer Board at the time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| happened and I was allowed to keep the permit that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| And I've held it for four years with no more problems whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=563)|
| 0:09:33| This is a new permit that you're seeking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Yes, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| And that's shall language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| I mean, what Mr. Farr said is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| We cannot legally, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| No permittee shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=585)|
| 0:09:53| I'll move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| I mean, when I talked to you, I didn't realize, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| if I had known this information, I would have told you it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| wouldn't have been any good because I didn't realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| there was a conviction there for an underage sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| Not to be smart or anything, but how does people keep their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| beer permits when they've done more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| I think you get into a technicality of once you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| the permit, the violation is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| And, you know, you probably, I'm not saying for sure, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| chances are you probably could still be operating at the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| location if you didn't have any additional violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| I had these violations when I had the permit before, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| allowed me to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| But did you get a new permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| It is grounds for revocation of a beer permit if one who has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| beer permit gets convicted of one of these offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Now, as with everything, as with speeding, as with everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| out there, it's an issue of enforcement and available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| personnel to follow up on these kinds of things to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| And sometimes we don't have sufficient personnel to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| How many are you allowed to have, did you say, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| read the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=685)|
| 0:11:25| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| I mean, they can take your license with one, but usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| Ian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| You actually had a hearing before this body after your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| second conviction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| And this body could have at that point, I guess we couldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| revoked, we could have revoked, we could have recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| The body chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| And that, I guess, is a discretionary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| For a new permit, we're not allowed to give you a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| permit, and because you're moving, you actually have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| What usually happens in the permit situation when there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| violation of sale to underage, what usually happens is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| employee sales, not the permittee, him or herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| It's frankly pretty rare when the permittee, him or herself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| actually does the selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| It's usually an employee who sells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| And then there are other provisions that apply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| regard to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| This same provision does not apply with regard to employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| as it does with regard to permittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| Now, just while we're on this, if she were to, if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| convictions were to be overturned on appeal, then she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| would be eligible to apply again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| She would be, but this occurred in 2003 and the time for appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| is long past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Well, what is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| It says appeal to circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| I don't know what that's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| No, that's another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Sale to underage that she was convicted of occurred in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=781)|
| 0:13:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=791)|

| 0:25:30| We are doing an upscale sports grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| I haven't read what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| I just had not had any contact with you and would have appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| I represent the district in which you're going to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1540)|

| 0:25:46| What are your plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| We are going to do an X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| I know that that area has a lot of business area in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| No, I mean what are your plans for opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| What's your date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Looking toward the end of probably middle to end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| Well, I'm going to recommend that we postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| I think our conversations need to occur prior to you coming before us for an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| What conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| You said you wanted to have some conversations with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| I would have appreciated hearing from you prior to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| So I'm going to move that we postpone this until the April beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| I didn't know if we were supposed to have prior meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Because I had met with Wanda and did all of the current paperwork and all of the paperwork, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1587)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| And I'm looking at opening hopefully by April 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1597)|
| 0:26:47| Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| Attorney Swanson, is there or I respect Council Member Pila's wish to meet with this applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| However, I don't, I'm not certain that there's anything in our regulations requiring such a pre-hearing meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| Is there some requirement that would cause us to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| I guess I'm uncomfortable with postponement if this is not something that's given in the packet to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| when she comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| I'm not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| There's no requirement and I'm not aware of anything in the packet that would require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I just have some, Council Member Roddy, I just have some real concerns about the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| and some other aspects of this from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| And I would have appreciated the opportunity to do that on a private, personal basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| and ask those questions and not at this meeting, at the beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| And that opportunity never came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| I really expected all day today that surely I would have someone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| Speak to me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Can I comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| I wasn't aware that I was supposed to call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| And I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Did you try to contact the applicant, Council Member Pila, with your concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| In the five and a half years I've been here, that's never been necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| I've never made contact with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| And they've all contacted you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Contact has always come to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| I think in my three years I've gotten maybe one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Well, it doesn't often happen, but I just have some questions that really concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| And, you know, if I don't have a second for that motion, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| And if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Ma'am, I would love to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I just, if it's pending us having a conversation, that's great because I look to do an upscale sports grill, an older client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| I don't mean that in any form of degradation here, but an upscale older clientele with 80s type motif and music and entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1723)|
| 0:28:55| So I don't know if you're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| I've had a beer permit here before, Mr. Hall, Mr. Wannaday, in the past, the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| I didn't know if there was some new regulations or new restrictions or paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| But I never had that conversation either on my other business prior to Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| And your other business was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| It was on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| It was also a bar and club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| What was it called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| It was called Amnesia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| And I sold it about a year after I bought it because it turned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| And that is, I'm in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| And this is a different ball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| Well, let me just to go to Ms. Pillow's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| The next Beer Board is on April 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| Would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| That would be after your opening date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| I have tentatively scheduled it for the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| And that's tentative, more realistic and more indefinite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Probably definitely it's going to be April 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| I actually want to respect Ms. Pillow's wishes to talk to this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| I actually do not want to start a precedent where everybody is calling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| I mean, I actually don't want to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| If I knew she wanted to talk to me, I would have, I follow all the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Wanda can tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| See, Mr. Hall, I've never had a citation violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| And I've had a beer permit in Blanton County for three years, the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| and in Knox County I had for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| No citations, no violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Let me ask, Mr. Swanson, would a motion that said, you know, we do this pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| would a motion to say pending approval, approval pending final documentation and a sit down with Ms. Pillow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1836)|
| 0:30:44| would that be a legitimate motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| It would be a legitimate motion to say approval pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| and the part about having a conversation with Ms. Pillow would be surplusage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| and it would be insignificant surplusage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| You could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| If that's what you want to do, I want to amend to all of your requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1867)|
| 0:31:18| Would you like to postpone this to the end of the beer board agenda and take five or ten minutes and talk to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Well, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1890)|
| 0:31:40| I assume that motion died for a lack of second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1913)|
| 0:32:02| Ms. Pillow, would postponing this until 7 o'clock, would that give you ten minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| Would that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| I really preferred your previous motion on surplusage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I will make a motion then that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Have we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I think that would be more beneficial to Ms. Maxwell and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| That is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| I'd like to move for approval pending final documentation and a conversation happening with Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| And, Amy, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Stay here until our meeting is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| I'll arrange time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I was going to ask if you want me to call if we arrange it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| We'll just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1968)|

| 0:32:56| Neighborhood, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1976)|
| 0:33:08| Adair Agunin, 2734 Willard Spring, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1988)|
| 0:33:16| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| For the record, there was a cell to underage in April 2001 with a guilty plea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| but it was dismissed with alcohol, glass, and court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I still need a copy of the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| task program certification, and final return from the former ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| Councilwoman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| That's an old line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| It's not considered applicable, but I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| Under on application for the second applicant listed, it says drug paraphernalia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| Knoxville, Tennessee, 7907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I assume that was a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Court date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Court date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Probably a court date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Court date, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| You all are presently working on this location, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| I've been by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| When do you intend to get this paperwork wrapped up, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| I don't have it with me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Well, it needed to be in to Ms. Day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| So, I mean, she rattled off approximately four to five things, including task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| Are you saying all of that is now complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| It's not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2086)|
| 0:34:46| I did call about the task program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| And I did supposed to have to go there on Thursday, but I didn't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| I have something to do in the store, so that's why I didn't go that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| So, but I'm planning on going for that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| You're not presently selling beer, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| No, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| We don't have no beer in our permit, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| I'll move approval pending final documentation considering he's got most of his paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Ms. Day, can you read that again, what was missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| A copy of the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning from MPC, task program certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| final return from the former ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Are you leasing from Wigles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Wigles still owns the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| And you're just on a lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| Any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Oh, Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| I respect Councilman Frost's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| However, I'd like to make it public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I'm not going to support approval of this permit because of the task certification not being completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| If that were in, I would be more comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| But that's critical for me in terms of an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| So, I would support a postponement, but I'm not going to support this motion because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| You do understand, sir, that you cannot sell beer until you get your beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| And what happens tonight if it is approved pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| That doesn't mean you can sell beer tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| You understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Correct that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| I understand that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| When are you planning on opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| We are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| We are opening, actually, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| I have only cigarettes and I have drinks and soft drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| That's all I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| And bread and some milk and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| I don't have no beer period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Right now, the cooler, the beer is supposed to go to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| It just has only soft drinks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Councilman Hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Well, I think I agree with Councilman Roddy about the task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| I think that's pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Chairman, I just would like to ask Officer Husky if he has been by and looked in on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2217)|
| 0:37:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| I was out there last week when we posted and there was no beer at all in the cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Nothing in stock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Nothing, ma'am, I promise to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| There's nothing in my store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| I know the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| I cannot sell beer and let it have lights, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| But I don't have anything in my period, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| And do you understand the significance of the task certification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2246)|

| 0:37:29| Councilman Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2249)|

| 0:37:31| I'm willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| I understand the concern about the task program and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I think it might actually be smart for somebody to make a motion for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| I would hate for this to fail because people are going to wish for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| I guess a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| I'll make a motion to postpone until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2278)|

| 0:38:07| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Well, I'll say no, too, simply because I feel that they have demonstrated that they understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| The rebel side over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| The rebels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Let's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| This is just a postponement, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Councilman Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| Go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Yes, we're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| That failed 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| I think it's important to note that he had scheduled to go to task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| He was going to go to Thursday before coming here, but something happened at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| You know, I give some weight to that and tend to believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| I promise to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| You sound very sincere when you talk about your store not being stocked and it's being validated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| And when you tell me you were going to do it Thursday, but something happened at the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| that carries a little extra weight with me as opposed to not having tried to at least get this thing going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| So I'm going to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| It's the only reason because he had to go to work in another store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| That's the only reason I didn't have time for somebody to open the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Like I said, I promise I don't have no beer and my permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| I don't have no beer, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| And I know the law cannot send no beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Well, I just wanted to comment, too, that I feel you two guys look like you're really stretching it to try to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| I mean, guys, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Really, guys, it's up to you to give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Really, we're just hard workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2386)|

| 0:39:55| I understand how important that task sort of thing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Yes, ma'am, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I did have it before when I used to work on 2400 Magnolia Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| And I did have that task, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| So I'm willing to have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| We're back on the original motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| Subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| I just want to say, you know, we've had this discussion before about how many and which ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| And we've had a workshop scheduled on a number of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| You know, he's going to have to go get his certification before he can legally sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| So I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2430)|

| 0:41:42| Is this the second one in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| It says number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| It would be the first store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| But we have a development contract to do five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2507)|

| 0:43:42| that you've had in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| Question number seven asks, have you ever been charged with one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| about liquid, but also, I'm sorry, the other one about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| misdemeanors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Have you ever been convicted of any misdemeanors, DUI, simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| assault, those kind of things in the last ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| And you said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| And let me check here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| You said you may have some of those actual type convictions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| have happened within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Why didn't you indicate that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| I thought I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I thought I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| No, you checked on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| You checked no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| But when looking at your record and the other information within the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| ten years, we've got several convictions for various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| misdemeanors, some that are outside ten years, but some that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Well, I don't recall too many within the last ten years that I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| The only thing that I've done is like I was driving on the road, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| thought I put down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| I mean, Mr. Swanson, you look at the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| In my assessment of the question with regards to question number nine, does your record reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| or the record you reviewed that he checked no on that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| That's what my application shows, that he checked no on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| But within the applicable time period, the records furnished by the police department wouldn't indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| a number of convictions within the time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| And that's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| And that being the case, would that be a basis for the denial of the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| Because the answer to the question being no and I don't want to say that he was not being truthful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2732)|
| 0:45:41| but we don't have a corrective and responsive answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| If the beer board finds it to be pertinent and that the beer board believes that he intentionally intended to mislead the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| beer board by not including this information, that would be a basis upon which the beer board could deny a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| I had no intentions of trying to defraud you in any kind of way or put down the wrong thing because I knew my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2758)|
| 0:46:08| police record would show anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| I just, I guess I just accidentally misinterpreted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| Based on the foregoing discussion, I'm going to make a motion that we deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| The motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| So, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| Thumbs up mark is next on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| And I have a note that they are requesting to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| I move to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2823)|
| 0:47:13| Whittle Springs Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2833)|
| 0:47:22| Chris McCurdy, 400 Hitchcock Way, apartment 1025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| We need the health department approval and final return from the former ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| I just wanted to say that, you know, we've been trying to rejuvenate Whittle Springs under a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2864)|
| 0:47:52| And we've, Vice Mayor Brown and others, have had some ongoing discussions about Whittles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| and not only the golf course but also the environment within the pro shop and the concessions and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| It was not a family environment, not a good environment for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| And I think they've really set the stage now to continue an environment that you'd want to take your kids there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| And all people can feel comfortable in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| So I hope with the beer permit we'll continue the successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you for that observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| We are trying very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| You know, I'd just like to add to that because when all this was under consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| I had several phone calls from fathers who very much wanted to be able to use that as an opportunity for their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2913)|
| 0:48:41| to be involved in golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| And so I'll have to say I really appreciate the work that's been done there and just hope that, as Councilman Bailey said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| that tone has been set and that that will continue because it is a great opportunity for young people to have their first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| opportunity in a wonderful sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| All in favor say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Wait, wait, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| This is a zoning question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| The golf course is in planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| And I don't know whether we have anybody here that can answer that question, maybe Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| But is it legal to permit to sell beer in a planned residential zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| Yes, planned residential allows for some commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| And it has to be approved as a part of the use on review for that planned commercial establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| I think Ms. Day had a question that a couple of folks brought to her attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| Ma'am, I had a request from the Dogwood Arts Festival and Food City, number 676.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| Because of some breakdown in communications and changes in, I think, an opening date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| they were requesting to be heard at a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| And it's our next council meeting on the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| And I was just wondering if you might have time for a short little beer board meeting that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| Could they say what is the reason for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Well, the Food City location, it's the new one on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Their opening date was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| It has been pushed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| And it kind of put them in a little bit of a bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| It is going to open April the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Instead of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| They really didn't tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| But I think it was supposed to have been in mid-May, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| And the Dogwood Arts, it was just a breakdown in communication, evidently, between me and the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3035)|
| 0:50:47| Well, I would just say it's very good news that Food City is in a position to open earlier than anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| And I believe that, what, 15 minutes ahead of 10 minutes, Chairman Howell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| I would make a motion that we have a special opportunity for those two applications to be heard, 10 minutes till 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| On the whatever date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| The 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| It's the 10th, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Is there any other business that needs to come before the Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| I get a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| And adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070327?start=3095)|
