| 0:03:04| Now we're on to Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Appeal by Arthur G. Seymour, Jr. for Clear Springs Baptist Church for MPC denial of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=185)|

| 0:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Arthur, did you want to get us started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| I am here with Chris Sharp, our engineer on this project, and numerous members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| Clear Springs Baptist Church and their pastor, Pastor Vitito.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Since they've come out on what may be a rainy night, I would ask them all to stand up, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| members of the church who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| If I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| A collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Can we take a collection real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| The pastor will here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| He's running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Lumpy will give the special music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Very respectfully, we request that this body overrule the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=252)|
| 0:04:22| This property is 18 acres that is zoned Plan Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| The church is asking that it be zoned Agricultural so that the zone will be in conformity with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| the remainder of the property that will be the site of the new church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| This is a vibrant, growing church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| They have achieved a great location at Harveston's Crossroads and Gibbs Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| The two issues that the MPC staff raised were traffic and drainage because this is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=287)|
| 0:04:57| Beaver Creek watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| We have done a traffic study, which MPC suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| That has been submitted by Mr. Sharp to TDOT and to Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| Also permits are pending from TDAC for the necessary permits there as well as from Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Mr. Sharp wanted me to put in a plug for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| TDAC said it was best plan or an excellent plan that he submitted for handling the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| surrounding Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| We anticipate that those permits will be coming shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Those were the issues raised by MPC, so we've already accomplished them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| We'd like one zone for the whole church property and the church anticipates going ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Arthur, let's see if we can't get a motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| MPC, do you have anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=356)|
| 0:06:06| You don't have to if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| I'm humbled, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| I believe I'd be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| We're here to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| I do want to ask you one question, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| To be honest with you, now I've heard all my life, and I'm not a logger, but I've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| been under the impression that a church never had to ask for a zoning, that they could build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| churches anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Now, these people have the right to practice religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| Now, I believe you're going against the Constitution of the United States there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| We do allow churches to be built everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| Well, why would they have to ask for a zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| They didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| They didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Well, why do you not want them to build up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| We don't not want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| I mean, that's what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| You recommend we deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Could we let him answer a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| If I could back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| The property is currently zoned partially agricultural and partially planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| A church is a permitted use in both of those zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Collectively, the site is about 30 acres, so a significant complex of church-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| uses and buildings could be built on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| If it's zoned agriculture, there is no further review by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| We feel that we add value when we do site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| There are significant issues with the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| There are significant issues with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=449)|

| 0:08:18| You did a good job, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| If your song leader is here, he can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| So I can stop getting the e-mails now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| We just saved the church $700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| I don't care about any of these letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| It didn't help you any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| None of these commissioners up here can read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Could we have a brief recess while Bud and I get to go back and shake their hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| I just want to say, I just want to applaud your all's congregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| Your people came out and supported, so it is really a good feeling, even though it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| not in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| It sure makes my heart that we have a great church in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=535)|

| 0:09:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| David, you all can go back to the back door, and then walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| That's why I wanted a brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Now, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| This is a Baptist church, but there were folks sitting on the front row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| There's no more seats in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Only seats left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| That was fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| It's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| We're going to let quiet down just a little bit, and we're going to get into our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=569)|
| 0:09:38| items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Let's take that break, and let Bud and Lesna, folks know better than to stay for the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=582)|
| 0:09:52| of the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Well, that didn't take them long, did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| That means he'll say howdy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| I'm going to pass this as a matter of only a matter of whether or not they're your elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=595)|
| 0:10:16| president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| We rock, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I'm waving at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Well, I tried to notice you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Okay, clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Discussion regarding the cost of building facilities in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| This is on page 15, other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Thank you, Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| I've had a lot of discussion by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| We've talked about mainly building schools and the cost of building schools, and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| had on many occasions sat here before my peers on county commission and expressed ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| and numbers and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| And I did a lot of due diligence in my research as it related to standing or talking before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=658)|
| 0:11:06| county commission concerning our school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| And I wanted to give you all an opportunity to speak and meet with some of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| that I have talked with since about February of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| So this isn't a short-term item, and it didn't just come about when the capital plan came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| But before I begin, of course, I see my other colleagues here, too, and I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| give the school board and the superintendent an opportunity to kick this discussion off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| If they would like to have anything to say, I'd be more than defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=698)|
| 0:11:53| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| And if you could just record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| My name is Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| I don't have a whole lot to say before the discussion begins, and we're here, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| to listen, to answer questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| We had extensive discussion a month ago, at which time the commission took action on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=729)|
| 0:12:18| considerable portion of the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| The board met two days later and so did not take any action at that point in time regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| the conversation that was had around the particular project at the Carter campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| We did have some discussion with the board of education about that particular item, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| what I committed to the board of education is that we've done a lot of due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| We've done a lot of homework ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| But there's some things that were raised in the conversation that I told the board I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| like to explore further, examine further, to either verify or dispel myths, and to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| able to come back to the board and speak intelligently about some of the issues that were raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| sometimes on the fly in the discussion that was had before the commission a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| My intention is to do exactly that, to continue to have some dialogue with, I think, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| of the folks who I see in the room here tonight, whom I've met with, Sandy Loy and Michael| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| Brady and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| I've done some tours of some schools in the region, some that have been raised in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| of the discussion that has been had, and I intend to continue to do some of that additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| work and exploration over the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| My intent, again, is to go back to the board of education, my employer first, and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| conversation with them to see if they are, first of all, if my recommendation to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| is modified in any way because of this additional exploration or not, and then to see if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| are interested in either affirming or modifying the vote that they've taken around the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| So that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| I anticipate, most likely, at the August 9th meeting, but at the extreme, at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| September meeting of the board of education, to come back and have additional dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| around what information, additional information we've gathered, again, as I say, to either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| verify some of the information that's been raised and some of the issues that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| raised over the dialogue around our capital plan or to dispel some of the myths that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| So I appreciate the opportunity to listen this evening and answer any questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| you may have, and appreciate the opportunity to stand before you and make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| I appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| And also, Dr. McIntyre, I wish to express my thanks for the work that you're doing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| the subject of Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| I really wanted to invite the superintendent up, so I know he's been working diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| I also know that he is going to come before county commission here in another, as he just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| said, 30 days or another month or two and be able to talk to the county commission at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| But I wanted to give him an opportunity to speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Tonight, on my discussion item, I've invited four areas of concern when you're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| And I was told that I ought to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| I don't know whether I really should or not, because I'm going to talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| things that I really do know a little bit about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I have built a lot of schools in my profession when I worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| I do have a doctor's degree in administration education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| I was a member of the facility planning organization back in the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| This is not my first rodeo when it comes to building schools or ideas about building schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| And we had a topic or two about that when I was at Columbia University that helped me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| learn a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| But I've learned a whole lot more since February, believe it or not, and I wanted to share with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| some of the people that I'd talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| I want to assure my colleagues here in the sense, as these individuals come up, the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| they want to share is of their own volition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| I've invited a general contractor by the name of Kent Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| I've invited a construction manager by the name of Sandy Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| I've invited a superintendent of schools, because his school is the one I've been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| off and on, and some numbers and misconceptions and so forth have been bounced around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| So the director of Union County Schools is here with me today, Mr. Wayne Goforth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| And I've invited an architectural engineering firm who actually builds some of these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| that I've been discussing and talking about new techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| And I just wanted to bring this data to Knox County Commission for whatever it's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| for whatever you want to ask questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| I'm not asking them to support my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I'm not asking them to refute my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| I'm asking them to come and to give a little talk and tell you some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| And they're here at your disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| I had to travel all over many counties to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| And they were gracious enough to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| And I, unfortunately, have held them for two and a half hours beyond what I had guesstimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| So let's get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| First of all, I'd like to call Mr. Kent Rose, who is a general contractor from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| and has built a lot of buildings in his day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| And I'll let him talk to you about what he thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Just have your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| It's Kent Rose, 6117 South Apopka Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| After watching the past several commission meetings where the discussions were about schools and their cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| I decided to use my 40-plus years of construction experience to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| I've been a licensed contractor in residential, commercial, and industrial building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| which quite simply means that I'm qualified to build any building in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| One of your topics concerns Claiborne High School as compared to Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1092)|
| 0:18:20| I called Sandy Loy, a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| He was the contractor at this school, or construction manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| and asked him if I could tour the school so I could see with my own eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| And this is what I found. I've got a video that I'd like to run you through, a little brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| This is me at Claiborne County High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| So I can show you that I'm physically there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Now here's what I found once I got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| This is the overall view of the school and the grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| And you can see from here, the roofs on the buildings are white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| and they have a 40-year rubber membrane roofing system on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| And all the roofs are pitched. They're not flat-topped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| And you can see in the background some of the ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| This is a view of the baseball fields and softball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| All of the ball fields meet all of the TSSAA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| This next picture is a picture of the tennis courts and the football field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1168)|
| 0:19:37| And then the next one is a picture of the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| The gymnasium is a TSSAA regional sanctioned gymnasium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| which is the best that you can get in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| This school is an all-block and brick building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| with the exception of the parapet walls on top there, the white ones, which are stucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| This is a state-of-the-art school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| This is a picture of the band room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| It also has three soundproof practice areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| Here's the art room, the library with no lights on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| the auditorium, which has the best acoustical design that I've ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| This is a well-equipped kitchen with a spacious cafeteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| with seating for up to 380 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| This is a typical classroom that meets all TSSAA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| There are several laboratories in the school that are fully equipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| This school has several vocational parts to it, including the cosmetology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| They've got greenhouses, several other shops that we're unable to show you right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| but it's fully equipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| This is a typical bathroom that has all the latest plumbing conveniences to save water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| This is the geothermal room that is state-of-the-art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| and it saves the school $100,000 a year on their heating, lighting, or cooling bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| This school has approximately 153,000 square feet in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| It was built for around $110 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| This included all of the athletic fields, shop areas, greenhouses, paving, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| There was enough money saved during the course of this construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| which totaled $17 million, that they were able to buy new computers for our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1300)|
| 0:21:50| Okay, I gave you a brief look about the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| Now, let me make a statement first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| I'm not here to condemn or to criticize the school board members or Superintendent McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| They're fine and honorable people and I'm sure they're doing their best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| However, it's apparent they are not educated in construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| and are dependent on others for advice, which has been wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| Claiborne High School was built for approximately $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Ms. Arden...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I hate to interrupt you, but your five minutes is up unless we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| I want to hear what he's got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Oh, yeah, let him talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| I'm just going to make sure we get that extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| All right, go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Okay, Claiborne High School was built for approximately $17 million, a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| Hardin Valley High School, from everything I can understand, was built for over $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Now, they're approximately the same square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| Now, having taken a look at both schools, I found that neither one is superior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| to the other in construction or in infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| Why Hardin Valley cost as much as it did, I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| I do know there was no bidding process, but rather awarding of a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| with no public disclosure of subcontract bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| This is the most expensive way to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| I would suggest that the school board and Dr. McIntyre get educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| on proper constructing practices so that they can make better decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| Now, I also understand that Dr. McIntyre wasn't here during the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| of the Hardin Valley School, so I wanted to let everybody know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| In conclusion, the money spent at Hardin Valley, if you'd done it properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| you could have built a high school just like Claiborne County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| which is state-of-the-art, as good as you can get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| plus six 550-capacity elementary schools for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1444)|
| 0:24:16| And you could have furnished every one of them with computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| To be a good steward of our taxpayers' money, it's your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| It's time to fix this problem now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| In conclusion, there's two more projects that's on the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Southwest Sector School and a Carter Campus Band-Aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1476)|
| 0:24:44| Total of over $23 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| We can build three 550-capacity elementary schools for the same amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| plus a new gymnasium for Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| All we've got to do is do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| I appreciate your time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Thank you, Kent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| The second person I'd like to call up, that was a general contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| when we were talking about building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Now I'd like to bring up Mr. Sandy Loy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| who is also a general contractor in the sense of building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| but he has a very unique process in his construction management techniques on building schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| I'd like for him to talk, if he would, a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| Sandy Loy, 601 Reliability Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Sandy, I hate to interrupt you real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I apologize for the interruption, but I'm told that Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| was not the same square footage as Claiborne County High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| that it's 275,000 square feet approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| So I just want to make sure the record reflects the appropriate level of square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| for that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Do we know how many students go to Claiborne County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Or the capacity as far as the number of students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| It's 1,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| 1,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| I don't think that many are there, but that's probably the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| It's about 1,000 attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| As a comparison, I know Hardin Valley was built, Dr. McIntyre, I believe, for 2,100 roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| I'm sorry, Sandy, if you'll just, for the record again, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| We'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Sandy Loy, 601 Reliability Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And I want to appreciate you all letting me get up and address the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| I've talked to most of you at one point in time or another about some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| and I have been with Dr. McIntyre and Doug Dillingham and his staff last Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| toured the Claiborne County School with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| I appreciate their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Dr. McIntyre was gracious enough after we toured that to spend about an hour to talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1617)|
| 0:27:05| I believe that we have been spending too much money on schools and construction in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| What I do want to say here is that there are a couple of things that have been thrown out and about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| and I know that Commissioner Hammond and I have discussed this at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| and I appreciate him taking the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| There's design questions and there's process questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| The design is something that we obviously want a facility that meets our standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| in terms of meeting the facility needs but also being longevity needs, whatever those may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1653)|
| 0:27:41| I think Mr. Dillingham and Mr. McIntyre felt that after they reviewed Claiborne High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| that it meets the construction standards that we would have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| It is not to say that it's better or worse than anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| but I thought it was important because there's been a lot of discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| The construction of that facility does meet good standards as we've built that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| I do know it also has geothermal technology for the entire school where Arden Valley does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| But, you know, it's not really about sitting down and wanting to talk about one school versus another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| It's about trying to find out a way for us to get the most bang for our buck for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| That's what I'm interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| That's what I've been interested in for the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| And whether or not I do it or somebody else does it is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| What's important is that we spend our tax dollars, and you guys know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| we're sitting here looking at deficits every year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| and we can't afford to continue to waste money when there are ways to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| Now, whether or not the school, you know, $110 a square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| and I don't know how much Arden Valley was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| I've heard $180 to $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| It jumps around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| But if it's 250,000 square feet, that's about $200 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| So that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Now, I also understand, and I want to make this clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| I understand that the school board was not the people behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| That was done through the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| But the point that I do want to talk about, and that I discussed with Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| and I discussed it when I used the methodology, there's only two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| because there's a, and I've got a copy here, of a statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| which is Senate Bill Number 2432, which was passed in 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| which specifically and very clearly outlines how the schools can be built in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| using construction management services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| So other than the traditional design it, put it out to bid to general contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| and then build it, which is what we've done quite a few of, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| the only other method that meets Tennessee law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| that I've been able to find anybody that would agree with that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| is construction management by this statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| And it is a method called construction management agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| We've all heard construction manager at risk, and we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| I don't think that that was actually legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| I've had a state comptroller agree with me that they didn't think it was legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Because this statute clearly says, and I'm going to read it to you, what the statute says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| construction work, which is under the coordination and oversight of a construction manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| shall be procured through competitive bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| That's clear as a bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| You either competitively bid it or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| And it doesn't mean you bid how you pick the CM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| It means that once you pick the construction manager, just like you pick an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| then they bid all the work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| What I think is very important to understand here is that there's some inherent costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| and I don't have time right now to go through all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| but there are certain things that costs go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| In a construction manager at risk contract, you can pick up any, it's an AIE standard contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| American Institute of Architects contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| There are items that are cost of the work, such as gross receipts tax, such as liability insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1870)|
| 0:31:19| that every dollar that passes through that construction manager, those costs have to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| That's not part of their fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| That's cost of the work, just like the bricks and the mortar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| With CM agency, those go away because the construction manager agent doesn't handle the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| They act as your agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| So that's just like, as I will share with Dr. McIntyre, it's like buying a TV set on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| You get the same exact TV set, you just don't pay sales tax on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Nobody gets hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| The building's no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| The quality's no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| The quality's no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| But by the process alone, you save a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| There's also bond costs that get eliminated because you're not double bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| And there's several other things that if we had time to sit down and I could go through a lot of detail with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| break down each and every area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| And there's some other mathematical anomalies that people don't really realize about how general contractors bid work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1935)|
| 0:32:25| And the fact is that general contractors, 80 to 85 percent of their work today is subcontracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| So the day you get your bids, you're getting a low combination of that 80 or 85 percent of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| It comes in at 25 or 30 pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| If you have a construction manager, you don't get the low combination, you get the low price in every category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| That alone is mathematically going to be a lower number every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| And what this boils down to is, the bottom line of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| the CM agency, if you take the same design and you go out and bid it to general contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| you take the exact same set of drawings and you use the CM agency method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| even if you don't even take into account that you would save money in pre-construction services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| even if you just did the bidding process the way the CM agency process works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| you're going to save somewhere between 7 and 10 percent just through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| So, you know, it's not just a matter, and I told Dr. McIntyre this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| it's not a smoking gun where you can say, here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| It's several different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| And what I would like to see and what I've advocated for is that we just try to consider a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| which allows us to save every nickel and dime we can in every specific category with the best design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| the best process, and the best actual procurement of those services and building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| so that you don't just focus on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| We need to do them all right, because when you add all of those together, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| you're talking about a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| And I can't sit here and tell you, you know, I know the term apples and oranges have been thrown out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| and it's been worked to death, but, you know, there's no two projects going to be exactly alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| You're going to be very difficult to equivalent two projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| But what I can tell you is that we've done ten schools using this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| and it's been successful every time at meeting and beating budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| The budget at Claiborne High School was $18.7 million, and we did it for like $17.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| So that was a $1.3 million, which if you do the math on that, it's around 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| And that was because the budget was set based on typical methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| And so what I believe, and what I believe has been shown on that, not only that, but nine other cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2080)|
| 0:34:48| is that the savings come from the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And I don't see why that we want to continue to waste money and throw money away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| when there's a process that's been proven that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| So is there anybody like to, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Sandy, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| We have appropriated $18 million for a new elementary school in the southwest sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| I believe that's the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| And I know that, as you said, it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| But from your estimation, how much would you think that an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| well, I hate to put you on the spot because we really don't have the specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| So let me go back to this other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| It was said that you had said that we might be able to build a Carter Elementary School for $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| Do you feel that that's still the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| I think you can build an elementary school for 500 kids, we're close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| But when I was having discussions with Dr. McIntyre, he's telling me he thinks it needs to be 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| So it depends on how many students, you know, how big the building is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| So if you had 750, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| In that case, I think it's around seven, half, or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| So we're not talking about $12, $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| We're talking about $7 to $8 million, in your estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| For Carter Elementary to get the bells and whistles that we're talking about and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Well, I will put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| On the southwest school, I don't know if you know the specs or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| but I guess we're looking at about 1,000, 1,200, 1,500 students down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| In your estimation, what would be the cost of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| Today's dollars, of course, right now we also discussed this last Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| and we had another architect with us up there talking about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| Costs right now are a little crazy because of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| Steel is actually going up in price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| But you're also getting savings in other areas because people are so hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| So you're getting costs moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| My guess would be if it's 1,250 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| my guess would be that that would be in the $18 to $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| Now, what kind of school was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| The elementary school, southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| I'm talking about a high school, which would include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| So if it was an elementary school, then that's probably going to be changed to probably 15 to 16 would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2221)|
| 0:37:13| I've had some folks tell me that the economy right now is working both for and against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| because we're not getting the tax revenues and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| But I was also told now is really a good time to build because of what you just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| the fact that people are hungry, they are willing to work, they're willing to sharpen their pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Yeah, you've got some things that are going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| We like asphalts going up because the oil has changed some over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2254)|
| 0:37:42| And you've got steel has gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| And so actually pre-engineered metal buildings have gone up almost 25% in just the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| So they're not as attractive now as they were six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| So that's why I think it's important to look at all the different areas and decide what type of building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| That's one of the things that this method of a construction manager working with an architect brings to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| is that it allows the architect to have somebody else looking at the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| and giving them an accurate cost estimate based on the latest information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| Because, you know, it's like mechanical engineers deal with their special area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| and electrical engineers deal with their special area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| And even though I may be familiar with electrical and mechanical costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| I'm not as familiar with it as the guys that are working with it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| And so even though architects have a lot of cost information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| what they have in front of them is what they've seen historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| And they may not be quite as close in touch with the cost information as a construction manager would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| Renovation versus building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| Again, in my conversations, people have said to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| you're better to build a new building because you have the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| There are 26 acres sitting up there at Carter Elementary specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| And so, again, I'm just, I don't know, but I'm asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| This is what I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| I'd be interested in your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Renovate or build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Well, renovating, you know, and I've gone through this exercise in the last 33 years a bunch of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| Because everybody that buys a building, the first thing they want to do is try to renovate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| Because they've been told that that was the thing they should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| You know, buy this building and you can renovate it for X and blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| And there have been a couple of times where we have renovated buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| But it was mainly when we renovated a small area for the sake of gaining the much larger area that was still usable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| like a warehouse or something, because you didn't have the change in function that changed very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| And so you only had to focus your renovation on a smaller area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| But the high majority of the time, renovation, especially when you're looking at a building that's 80 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| due to the lead paint, due to the asbestos, due to mold issues, leaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| and the fact that, you know, the infrastructure of the plumbing and the electrical are so far outdated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| you probably don't have many firewalls at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| To bring it up to fire code, to bring it up to egress issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| very rarely do I find that renovation makes more sense than building new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| All right. Anything else for Mr. Lloyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| Why do you think Hardin Valley was so high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Well, I know that there's probably several things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| but I think the fact that, and I know Mr. Rose mentioned the fact that it wasn't bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| I think that the promise there was for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| and I know that Mr. Dillingham and I talked about the fact that he didn't have anything to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| but I think there was mentioned the fact that people could expect it to cost more so they could get it faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| It makes no sense to me, really, because construction management should not cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| I realize the schools didn't have anything at all to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| That makes me a little skeptical about everything, that it's that much higher than what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| Of course, I've seen the schools build some buildings, and they've been great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| but I've seen PBAs handle some of these jobs, and they've been terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| Well, to put out the scope of the work, one, I think it's to follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| I think we have to bid out the individual pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| And what I also share with Dr. McIntyre is there's no method more transparent than CM agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2506)|
| 0:41:54| And I'll give you just one quick little example, and that is if I'm a general contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| and I bring in a bid on bid day and I've got 35 sub-bids and vendors in my price, you don't know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| You don't know what their bids are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| All you know is my bottom line number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| All my competitors do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| So you're in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Now, but if you've got a CM agent, every one of those bids, every component is bid publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| Advertised, bid publicly, open publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| I mean, you can't get any more transparent than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| There are no more secrets underneath the table that nobody knows who's got what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Everybody that's qualified to bid the masonry bids the masonry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| If they get beat, they know why they got beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| And the paper can publish it the next day, every bid in every specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| And that's another thing that does trouble me is that while we don't even, I can't find out for sure what Hardin Valley costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| Because I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Every school we've ever done, I can hand you a sheet of paper on a monthly basis and tell you to the dime exactly what's being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2575)|
| 0:43:04| And for that not to be out there in public knowledge, I think, tells us that that doesn't make sense for public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| And, you know, if Brad Anders decides he wants to build a building and he wants to trust me to build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| then that's his business because it's his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| But if we're spending public dollars, I think we've got to be completely transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| The CM agency method, one, it makes sense mathematically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| And, two, it's as transparent as you can possibly get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| And what you said is about the schools building buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| They have been successful in the past building good buildings for good price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| If you use the tried and true method of design it, bid it, build it, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| whatever that number is, even at its best number, CM agency is going to be a little lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| So my point is, not that that's a bad method, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| And it's also CM agency is much less litigious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| You have fewer lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| You have less adversarial relationships, which, of course, lead to lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| And you have, it's just a better system in terms of everybody pulling together as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| So it's not to say that the design, bid, build method is a bad way to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| But in today's world where there's 80 to 85 percent of the work chopped up into pieces for the general contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2663)|
| 0:44:31| it's not like when general contractors used to have brick masons and painters and carpenters and concrete finishers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| and all those guys on their payrolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| If you go around to all of the general contractors in Knoxville now, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| the majority of them, they don't have all those people on their payroll because they can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| You can't afford to maintain that type of a payroll of 200 people to build buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| So those people are out there moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| So block masons are working for different people and the concrete finishers are working for different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| And so it's real important that you get the best possible combination of all those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| And the only way to do that mathematically, okay, and statistically, it's proven, is with this particular method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| Now, my process doesn't explain the difference between $18 million and $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| The process, but you've got to understand that if those schools that I built were of the same size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| they would be in probably $28 to $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| So what happens between $30 and $50 million, I can't explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| I can understand $35 million if you just bid it out to general contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| but what happened between the other $15 million is a mystery and I'm sure probably always will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2744)|
| 0:45:52| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Hey, Sandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Hey, Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| When we talk about CM agency, and I'm trying to, I think I thought I had it grasped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| until you talked about it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| So you as a CM agency would ask, how do you win your bid to be the CM agent for the schools or for a building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2763)|
| 0:46:12| How do you, do you say, okay, this cost plus or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| It's just, as a matter of fact, this statute covers that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| And it's just like, it's a professional service, just like selecting an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| We can pick you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| You'd put an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| You have to put out an RFP in which Doug and I talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| This particular statute says RFP, which the word proposal people think automatically means a numerical bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| But it says here, after it tells you all the different things you can consider, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| cost is not to be the sole criterion for evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| So it's a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| You put your resume in to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| And then you bid out separate components, mechanical, electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| You paid a set fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you, Sandy, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| It was enlightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| And I also want to, I do appreciate the school board's time and energy last week going up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| They spent a lot of time with me, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| I wanted to bring another perspective because I had thrown a dear friend of mine out to the wolves on some of my conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| and I wanted to give him an opportunity to come and talk about his school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| and an opportunity to talk about a little educational theory and learning theory and how he does his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| And, anyway, I'd like to welcome Wayne Goforth, who's the director of schools for Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| And I talked about Paulette to you all on more than one occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| so I thought I'd let Wayne come and comment and send him an apology for any embarrassment I might have caused him along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| So Wayne Goforth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Good evening to all of you from Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| My name is Wayne Goforth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| P.O. Box 10, Maynardville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| I am the director of schools in Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| and I have been told that this governing body was informed that Union County builds cheap schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| I felt compelled to address this information and to shed light on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Union County operates off a small tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| so our projects must be built with every penny of every dollar utilized efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2898)|
| 0:48:26| This, however, does not equate to cheap schools, as you have been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| Just a bit of background for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Tennessee, the state of Tennessee, didn't embrace education until 1899 with any true support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| but Union County was slightly ahead of the curve then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| By 1890, most every child in Union County lived within walking distance of a community school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| Now, I must say that these schools were one-room schools and one teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| but they were within walking distance, and sometimes that distance was three miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| and I'm sure you've heard from all of your grandparents that they walked to school with no shoes in the snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| How many of you have heard that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| It doesn't have to be grandparents. It could be some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| But anyway, we had schools back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Union County had supported their schools even before Tennessee embraced that fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| and that trend has grown only stronger throughout the years, as you will see if you come to Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| I also would like to establish that the Union County schools is an ever-improving school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| that was ranked in the top ten schools using the state report cards as printed in your Knoxville News Sentinel in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2981)|
| 0:49:50| I also feel that it's necessary to point out that Union County's low tax base comes into play again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| If you will look at the blue sheet that you have in your possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| you'll notice that the local contribution is 16% for Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| whereas Knox County contributes 54.8% from the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| We are getting far more, far more for our buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| Union County teachers and the school system have been asked for years to do more with less, and we are doing that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| In fact, we may not even feel the new standards because we're used to doing more with less when they come into being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3026)|
| 0:50:35| Our county is dedicated to providing the children of Union County with a top-notch education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3035)|
| 0:50:43| Now, for the new building project, once again, research has shown to be the most productive and successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3043)|
| 0:50:52| and what it's shown me is that we have chosen to build a community school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| If you will look in your research and do a little research, all you have to do is Google it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| and you will find that small learning communities, small learning communities are the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| and research has shown and educators have found that the smaller the learning community in an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| the better education the students get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| That is of significance, and it shows in our county with our four elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| Our number one school that is always in the top ten schools of the scoring of the TCAP scores is Sharps Chapel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| and they come in with 140 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Right under them is Big Ridge Elementary School, another top contender with the TCAP scores, 260 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| And then you go on to Luttrell with 450, and they are coming out off of the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| and they have scored traditionally high in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| Then you compare that with a school that we have that is 750 students who are on the target list because they are so big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| We have never done well with large schools, and it's because the smaller learning community is the way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3125)|
| 0:52:13| and the research shows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| The new building project will serve 550 students, up to that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| It's called Paulette Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| This school is being built to the state code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| It's been brought up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| It's from an old plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| The school is 54,000 square feet, and it sits on 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| The building is constructed with block and brick walls with a steel frame and 18-inch thick insulated walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| The metal roof is rated at 25 to 30 years in life expectancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| The design, with all the special areas and the cafeteria within the center of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| will provide maximum instructional time with less time needed to walk down those long halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| and throughout the entire school that you see in the old design of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| Not only is the infrastructure well-built and well-designed, the security of this school is impeccable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| Now, you don't have to believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| You can go see this school being built if you'll drive up Highway 33 from Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| go across the Knox County line about a mile and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| look to your left before you get to Milan Church, and you'll see that being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| Now, if you can't do that, you can go to the website, and I'll tell you that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| But what I do want you to know is the total price for just the building is $4,856,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3225)|
| 0:53:57| That is using our taxpayer money efficiently because we know we're building a great building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| We're building an education for our future, for our kids, and for their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| And bottom line, Union County is building a well-built, well-designed school for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| We are very proud of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Is it cheap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Is it efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Take a look at our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| If you can't drive up there, go to www.schoolforourkids.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3267)|
| 0:54:36| and you can take a tour of the whole building process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| It's very transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| You'll never see a site like this where you see a school built from the ground up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3281)|
| 0:54:48| from buying the property to developing the property, all the way up to where it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| I appreciate you letting me come and talk to you about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| I hope you'll be impressed because I know our folks are in Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| Any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| What's the construction time on your school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| How many months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| 360 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| We hope to be finished in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Wayne, what process did you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| We've heard about construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| What process did you use in building the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| We worked with Michael Brady Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| and used their advice on how to do the bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| It was bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| I think we had 14 bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| And Rouse Construction came in at the lowest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| We had several pullouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| I think they're called alternates that we could work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| But it came in way under bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3351)|
| 0:55:59| Sir, let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| This is just a numbers question and not a criticism of you or your system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| I'm just looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| It just seems, it surely seems inequitable for the Knox County taxpayer that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| roughly a third of our budget from state funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| but Union County, for example, gets 70 percent of their budget from state funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| So we get less than 10 and Union County gets about 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| Is that demographics or is that the Louis Donaldson lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| That is the BEP money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| The BEP money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| For the most part, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| It just goes disproportionately, I guess, to smaller districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| We have very few businesses and we have very little industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| And if people come and shop, they usually shop in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| So we get a little more help from the state to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| and help us with that BEP money to give us more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| If it weren't for the BEP funding, we could not operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| I'm not criticizing your system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| I was just curious about the perceived inequity for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Wayne, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| I'm sorry I kept you so late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| I appreciate your friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| I don't think I'll get home by milking time, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| And if you get a ticket for your parking, you let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Parking is a problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| I'd like to now introduce Michael Brady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| This is the architect and engineering firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| that has provided all of us with a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| I'm not going to blame Michael for anything out of the ordinary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| but during my time on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| I've received a lot of information from his company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| I've read over it with interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I wore him out and tried to squeeze everything out of his head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| that possibly I could learn along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| because I was highly concerned with how we were spending taxpayers' dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| not just on the school system now, but just in buildings in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| So I'd like to turn this over to Michael| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| and let you hear from an architect and an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| which will complete the scope of work kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| if we were going to build this building today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you, Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I'm Michael Brady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| I'm 299 North Wise Garber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| I'm CEO of Michael Brady Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Hopefully everybody's still awake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| It's getting a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| But we're an architectural engineering firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| We were recently listed in the architectural record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| in the top 250 firms in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| We work all 50 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| We're known for being technologically innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| and a leader in technological use of products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| and also in design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| A lot of what I want to share with you is a little different approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| because a lot of tools can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| and there's hundreds of things we do to make things more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| We call it a smart design focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| We really list three criteria for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| The number one criteria we have is, is it improving education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Number two criteria is, is it lowering initial cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Number three criteria is, is it lowering ongoing cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| Our designs were very focused towards lead things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| before there was such a thing as lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Dr. McIntyre and Doug Dillingham visited Fairview Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| which was done 11 years ago and was done kind of a prototype,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| initial focus, and we were kind of charged in Anderson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| with a budget by a commission that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| well, if we don't give them enough money to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| maybe they won't build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| I'm sure you wouldn't ever do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| But we only had about $3.5 million to build a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| and I said, we can do it, and we're going to do it better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| than it's been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| And a lot of these concepts are done by other architects around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| We're not the only one following this trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| Just a quick example I've sent out of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Just one of the simple things we do is keep the building simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| Looked at it right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Partly it was you get rid of roofing leaks when you keep it simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| And this is just a quick example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| You can see on the same square footage of Scheme A and Scheme B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| you have 22,480 square foot of exterior wall in Scheme A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| And Scheme B, you have 36,100 square foot of exterior wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| You also have longer runs of mechanical, longer runs of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| All those things get larger and bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| and right away it translates into probably a million, million and a half dollars of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| Very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| It doesn't take a rocket science to figure out that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| A lot of other little things we do is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| I know Knox County has every teacher has its own office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| and we ran into that when we were doing a prospect school on Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| They were used to every teacher having their own office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| And I said, what if I build you a technology center in your corner here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| and I give you 170 cubic foot of storage cabinet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| I give you a P-top desk, you have many conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| I give you a monitor that connects into your Internet system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| and I give you a projection deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| and you can have live design throughout the country and your state-of-the-art technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| And teachers looked at it and said, okay, that sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| It was more usable, it was more functional form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Translation in that of the building, you take about all those out of the deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| you save another million, million and a half dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| Another little thing, we do six-inch block walls versus eight-inch block walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| You say, well, what's two inches of block wall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| And you walk in, you can't tell the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| It wears the same, has the same durability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| Well, two inches over a whole building translates into probably $100,000 just in square footage cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| let alone other things that you add up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| And I saw you guys debate for I don't know how long on $10,000 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| So I know, you know, $100,000 is worth some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| An early architect I worked with always told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| we all start dealing with large numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| He says, just take $500, drop it off your desk, and see if you want to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| It starts to get your perspective again where money is and how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| But that, the walls we do, new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| You can do seismic things and new anchor bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| You can do epoxy grout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| We turn it into a thickened slab of eight inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| We dial in and we run seismic reinforcement up through all the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| And we pour all the slab at once, and then the walls go on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| You get a better slab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| You reduce instead of year schools, typically the walls go all the way through down to a footing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| which has two number fours continuous, number threes at 12 inches on center the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| And you just add up all these footings, and we've got little eight inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| And we stop the wall at 10 inches above the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| and we put insulation around the perimeter of the deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| and we've got the same acoustics you've got in year schools, but we save a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| So it's a cumulative of lots of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| And our construction, steel frame, they call it pre-engineered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| but steel frame, the same as the building you're standing in right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| Now, it's a steel steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| I mean, the one thing we went to that route is it got longer spans we could do because of lighter structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| and a reduced steel cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| And what you do is like here you've got a metal deck up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| and you've probably all seen a fluted metal deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| and then you've also seen standing seam roofs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| which everybody considers better and a longer life and less leakage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| And so what we do is we combine that, and you take the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| and you just build it up, and you let it be the structure and the roof at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| And all of a sudden you've reduced, again, a substantial amount of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| We go to an R30, which is higher than I think any of the schools you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| with a super saver insulation system, and it reduced energy costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| We look at we're using a new panel system, a metal span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| We designed their plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| We knew about the panel over in South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| And it's a sandwich panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| They use it for ice storage buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| but we're using it for the upper part of the buildings where you can't touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| Real longevity life, higher insulation value, less thermal transfer through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| and many directions in that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| But, you know, those are just a few of the many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| Security, like Mr. Goforth said, really focused on that, how do we control people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| And you're welcome to come visit, you know, Prospect Elementary or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| I get Paulette and Prospect confused with all the Ps, or Paulette too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| You'll find they are state-of-the-art schools, great facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| and they're just a lot less cost in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| I would give a little defense on PVA a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| I heard them getting a little trashed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| But I remember when they got selected to do the school out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| and I told Blaise Birch, who was at the time, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Blaise, you realize you don't have any control of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| you don't have any control of the selection of the product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| you don't have any control of the deal, all you can do is handle the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| and this is a no-win project for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| Blaise left, by the way, you noticed that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| Anyway, a lot of times they don't have control of some of the things that happen in those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Do you agree with Sandy's assessment that a Carter Elementary could be built with the figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| I believe he said 7 to 8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Was that correct, 7 to 8 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| I ran a quick number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| Once you've got the core there, you don't change a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| The core gets a little bigger, but you're adding classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| and Paulette was at 5.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| That includes all the site work and all sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| and he did not have an easy site by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| If you added it up and you moved it up to 1,000 students, you had about 1.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| so 8.5 million, somewhere in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| It would get you, shouldn't be any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| And I definitely agree with his assessment on new versus renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| Everything has a life, and that building's past its life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| You just need, it's time to build a new school, and you get a lot more for your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| Just maintenance, ongoing, operation costs, the future, the payback's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| If you look at initial costs of building, it really adds up over the life of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| Maybe 5% of the cost, the rest is operational costs through the next 30 years or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| And, you know, you're just not, you're better off with a new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| You're talking about the things that you're using to save money, the ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| the creative ideas, by the way, and saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| I'm just going to ask you, why does Knox County not embrace these ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| Or maybe they do embrace them, but it's costing us more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| I think what we're trying to get at is we're hearing these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| and I'm hearing it not only from you but other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| that outside the county line we're able to do things less expensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| but yet it's good product and so forth, but when you move inside the county line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| the price seems to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| I'm trying to get my arms around this because I think our citizens are looking to us to get our arms around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| So I'm just asking you your opinion if you would care to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| It's probably a combination of a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| I mean, one of the things is you're dealing with a program that is out of date, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| and sometimes you have to make some efforts like we did in Prospect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| The teachers had in their mind they're going to have classrooms, their offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| We showed them why they could get something better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| but we went the extra mile and effort to save that money because, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| it was just those offices end up storage rooms and they don't use and they cost so much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| They also, and I think Knox County also has a storage closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| That storage closet is tremendously expensive when you really look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| and, again, it gives you a box area and they pile stuff up in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| We do, in Paul Ladd and stuff, we've got, I think, 450 cubic feet of storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| and we come out two foot from the wall and we do cabinetry from floor to ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| We don't have to paint the wall behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| We don't have to put ceiling over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| We don't have to put flooring under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| And we get 450 cubic feet of easily accessible storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| which is far more than they get their storage room for a fraction of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| But, you know, I think, and as Dr. McIntyre indicated, they're looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| and I think it would be really beneficial to just look at, hey, let's do new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| I think the other thing, there was a mentality for a number of years that we're going to do every school exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| And we've always had a viewpoint as we're going to do every school better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| and more reaching in the future than the last one we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| If we haven't, we haven't done our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| And it's a different philosophy of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| You know, they may not have been charged with that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| I think it would be great for them to head that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| I've voiced my, we had a panel a number of years ago with a bunch of other architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| and they talked about how everything was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| And I said, well, I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| I said, we ought to be challenging each of us every time to how do we do a better design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| more cost efficient, better for the education, better for the teachers, better for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| than we did the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| If we haven't tried to beat ourselves one after another, we haven't done our job as architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| Michael, what could you think you could build a school in Southwest Knoxville that they're wanting to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| From what you've seen and just, I don't know if it's a fair question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| You're talking about 1,000 student elementary school, I think is what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Is that right, Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| How many students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| 1,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| 1,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| What would you estimate it would cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| I think you're probably in the $12 to $15 million, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| $12 million probably ought to do it, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| And, in fact, we were working with the developer of that property out there for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| and we were coming up with some new concept directions, much more contemporary and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| In that route, we're working on a real contemporary, state-of-the-art high school focus right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| and it's going to have the imaging on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| We also did Ted Russell Ford out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| I don't know if you've ever seen the one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| And it's more of that imaging, and we're looking at doing a high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| more in the $28 million range for a couple thousand students, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| And what could you build a new Adrian Burnett for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| This number may have already been put on the floor of the table, but how many at Prospect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| What kind of student population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| And what's the number for construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| The Prospect School, it's got a core capacity of 650, and it's 9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4228)|
| 1:10:36| Now, there's a lot of things involved in that, and that's just not building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| That's all the site work, and it had a tremendous site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| We had to run sewer miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| It's expanded, set up for a future middle school on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| It also, one of the things that came out, and right about the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| you'd seen this tornado take place in West Tennessee and wipe out this school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| traditional construction school over in West Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| We're also dealing with a 911 director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| We've got a lot of extra things like music rooms, art rooms, and we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| you know, it probably wouldn't take us much more in those areas to do a hardened area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| that would act as a shelter for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| So it's got a full shelter in this thing that will house all the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| in case of a super storm, you know, catastrophic event sort of thing in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| We've also got a covered bus drop-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| We've got a bunch of technology rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| We've got teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| We've got volunteer training rooms, volunteer assistant rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| It's a substantially expanded school from some of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| So it's 83,000 square feet at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| So it's still, you know, very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Also has areas where it's got covered play areas where you can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| and add extra classrooms in the future in a very short time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| versus going out and doing a portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| So if I recall, the numbers put out, we were talking about 500 at Carter, 5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| We were talking about 700 at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| We talked about 7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| So is roughly speaking a million per hundred students a good number to work off of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| Yeah, it's pretty close in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Okay, and you're talking about 1,200 at Southwest, 12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| I think Sandy threw out a little higher number maybe at Southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| Yeah, I thought he was a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Okay, well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| And is that the Union County, Paulette, is that equivalent to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| or is that maybe even lower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| That's probably on the lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| I mean, it's really cost-efficient in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| A pretty good rule of thumb is a million per hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Michael, thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| and I'd like to thank everybody that came down here that I've worked with for months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| and I appreciate you coming and sharing your knowledge with the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| And before I shut her down, Sandy wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| I just want to make sure you all know that my numbers include site work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| But I do want to make one thing clear on what I've been studying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| and Dr. McIntyre and I have talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| and a lot of the numbers that have been bantered around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| and the cost and things associated with schools in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| have absolutely nothing to do with our current superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| because he's not the guy that was here when all this went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| And I want everybody here to understand that all these discussions have, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| zero reflection on our current administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| and I'm sure I haven't made that clear as I'm trying to right at this moment in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| And I also do appreciate Dr. McIntyre's willingness to take this bull by the horn personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| and he is doing his due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| and I look forward to hearing whatever his recommendation is in the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| and I appreciate what he's done and what he is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| and where he's headed with the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| and I believe one of these days we're going to be second to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| I mean, I have no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| But I just did this tonight for one reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| it's because people were questioning where I was coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| and I'm just saying, hey, I'm not smart enough to come from all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| I'll bring the people that it's coming from so you could ask your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| So, Vice Chairman, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Just to be fair, Dale Smith with PBA or Superintendent McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4458)|
| 1:14:27| do you have any response or would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| I was going to give you this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| You don't have to if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| I'm just giving you the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| and hear from folks and also for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| The time we spent with Mr. Brady and Mr. Loy I think is very helpful to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| the opportunity to visit a couple schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| and we'll continue to do some more of that in the coming weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| before I go back to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| I did want to mention that on your consent calendar there was an item there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| around a joint committee around facilities including schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| and I know some of you know that some of our school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| did have some concerns about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| but I did talk to Commissioner Hammond about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| and it sounds like there's a potential opportunity to perhaps restructure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| to more of a public dialogue and discourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| and perhaps a joint meeting at some point rather than a formal committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| and I'll look forward to having some of those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| with commissioners as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| So I just wanted to make sure that I expressed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| because several of our board members did have some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| that they wanted me to share with the commission this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| Beyond that, I appreciate the information and the opportunity to listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| Hi, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| And name and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Dale Smith, Public Building Authority, 400 Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| There are a number of things that were said tonight by Mr. Loy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| and his predecessor that I disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| I don't think this is the time or you have the time to get into the details of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| I think, honestly, a committee like Commissioner Hammond has teed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| is exactly the kind of place to get at these types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4577)|
| 1:16:24| You're dealing in areas that are very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| I do want you to understand that in the 10 years that I've been at PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| we've delivered about $500 million worth of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| And I think you would laugh if you thought that either the county mayor or city mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| allowed us to do that without bidding everything that went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| We select our construction managers competitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| Under them, everything that's done on that job is bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| And there are lots of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| Mr. Loy touched on a couple of them, that prices change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| Hardin Valley, for instance, was bid out exactly during the post-Katrina reconstruction of New Orleans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4623)|
| 1:17:13| Very different than what you'd get if you bid things out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| But earlier this evening I suggested to Commissioner Hammond that to that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| he consider adding a senior faculty member if UT is willing to provide one from the School of Architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| I've been to a number of their programs on project delivery methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| I will tell you that the methodology we use almost exclusively in Construction Manager at Risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4659)|
| 1:17:46| along with a different methodology which is called Design Build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| are the two methodologies most prevalent in the industry, both private and public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| You don't hear Construction Manager agency even mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| and that's because while there are some cost savings, there's an enormous difference in risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| The owner is carrying all the contracts and all the risks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| and that is something that you can choose to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| but you really better know what you're doing if you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| So I think I'll leave it at that and simply say that I look forward to working with the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| Commissioner Hammond has put together, I guess in September it'll start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| and I'll feel very proud to explain what we do, how we've done it, and what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4711)|
| 1:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Thank you. Anything further on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| I'd like to have the opportunity to respond to something there Mr. Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| The Construction Manager, one he mentioned, Construction Manager at Risk and Design Build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| the problem with those two processes is those are illegal for schools in Tennessee per statute that I read you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4738)|
| 1:19:07| Nothing wrong with either one of the processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I do them all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| But also he made the mention about the fact that the risk is associated with CM agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| and that is something that's a fallacy that's presented by people that want to try to rebut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| But the fact of the matter is, is that you can either have a bond which protects you from the general contractor, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| and in which cases today's market, I can tell you because I'm a general contractor and I do procure bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| anybody that's in the bond business will tell you today that you're going to also have to get bonds for anybody over $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| or they're not going to bond because they're not going to put you out there on a bond for $20 million and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| okay, I just think Sandy Loyal will make sure it's all taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| I don't care how much money you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| And so they want you to get bonds on your subs, so you're paying for that bond twice, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| Now, CM agency, you still get the bond on the subs, but you don't have to pay the CM agent for a bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| so you save that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| It's another cost you save, but you're still protected because you have a payment performance bond on every segment of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| So the deal about, you know, that there's a lot more, there's no more risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| And as a matter of fact, I would argue that I think the risk is diminished because as I have built several schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| if you have one segment that you have a failure in, okay, it's not my bond at risk, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| I'm not trying to protect my bond and try to keep you from knowing what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| I'm trying to protect you as your advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| And I can go after that one segment's bond and get that fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| And that's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| We've done that in which the municipality we're working for, it didn't cost them a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| So, again, that's a lack of understanding about how the process works, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| is one of the fallacies that gets out there, but I wanted to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Just real quick, Commissioner Hammond, if we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| I'd like to keep Commissioner Armstrong somewhere in the loop because he's put a lot of work into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| if he'd want to, but he's put a lot of work into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| Consider that in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| Discussion regarding the Pam Reese report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Commissioner, what I want to do is I'd like to postpone that for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Let's just wait for the new administration to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I want to, that's why I was asking Mr. Mace today when his lawsuits would be over with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| so maybe some of that stuff would be over with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| and we could have a little more stuff we could sink our teeth into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| Discussion regarding the Knotts County Health Department's RFQ on pediatrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4903)|
| 1:21:51| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Well, where's Martha?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| She has borne with us all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Let's let her talk to us for a few moments and tell us where we are on this RFQ regarding the pediatric services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4919)|
| 1:22:07| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Martha Buchanan, Director of Knotts County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| Thank you for the opportunity to come and discuss the process we're undergoing with our pediatric clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| Some of you were at the committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| Some of you weren't, so I'll just quickly explain what has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| Our pediatrician is planning to retire at the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| I believe it's the 1st of December, December 3rd or so will be his last day with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| And in light of that, we considered our options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| and how to continue to make sure these children get the care they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| And one of those was to put out an RFQ for one of our local outpatient providers of pediatric services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| to take over the management of that clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| We put out a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| There was some confusion about when the bid went out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| and one of the prime potential bidders chose not to bid because they didn't know the bid went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| So there was some confusion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| We've reissued that bid for a short term for two weeks and anticipate getting a bid back, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| with the concept of continuing to provide the care that these children get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| This is a 10-care clinic and an uninsured clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| There aren't many uninsured children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| And to hopefully also our existing staff will maintain their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| And from the patient's and parent's standpoint, they shouldn't see much of a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| Any questions or concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| Dr. Buchanan, so your proposal is to keep it in the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| and have somebody run it and keep the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| So you're just having somebody manage the office, provide a physician to sign off on everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Is there anybody who would like to bring anything forward from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5032)|
| 1:24:01| Real quick, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| August the 10th, you'll be getting a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| We're going to have a rules committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Commissioner Harmon or Ivan Harmon will be over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| We're going to kind of begin the discussions for the next commission with structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| and meeting dates, I guess, kind of start the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| And that way we can hit the ground running in September with everything we've postponed until September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| August 10th, 4 o'clock, small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Hearing and seeing nothing else, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5071)|
| 1:24:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100726?start=5080)|
