| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Okay, I haven't had anybody else come into the meeting for a little bit now, so we'll go ahead and get started again. Thanks everybody for being on this meeting. I appreciate your participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=30)|
| 0:00:39| This is just a quick list of the things we're going to cover today. It's just a real quick overview of what the plan is and how it fits in with other plans, what its purposes are we're going to look at the updates to this year's plan for 2021 and the timeline of adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=39)|
| 0:00:54| And then here's just a list of some of the maps that we have available on our online mapping application, which we will go into in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=54)|
| 0:01:05| So some of you who are more familiar with our processes will be aware of some of this, but we might have some some folks who aren't as familiar. So I'll also go over how this plan fits in with all the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=65)|
| 0:01:19| So there is the growth plan. It starts off with the more broad plans and kind of gets more fine tuned as you go down the slide. So the growth plan was adopted in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=79)|
| 0:01:30| It mapped to various growth growth areas, so it's got city limits and then their urban growth boundary showing the city's growth over the next 20 years that where that could possibly occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=90)|
| 0:01:40| And then the plan growth area where areas could be could grow in the next 20 years and then a rural area, which the growth plan describes as land preserved for farming, recreation and other non urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=100)|
| 0:01:53| And for that reason, it's got more limitations placed on the density in that area. And so the growth plan influences all the all these other plans, just because of those, those different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=113)|
| 0:02:05| Then going into the general plan of 2033 this establishes general policies and principles that guide development and these policies and principles influence the sector plan. So you've got both of these plans and influencing sector plan, which in turn influences the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=125)|
| 0:02:22| So there's 12 different sectors. Six of those are designated as city sectors and six of them are county, although they don't align with the city county line. So there are some county areas that are in city sectors and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=142)|
| 0:02:35| They're basically the land use plan for the general plan. It's just that they're smaller so they can be updated periodically. The goal is to update these every five to 10 years, although there's some out there right now that are a bit older and are in need of update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=155)|
| 0:02:51| And then it kind of goes into, you know, these smaller area plans down here for plan, small area plans and so on and so forth. These are typically done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=171)|
| 0:03:00| Individually, and then they they kind of get fed into the sector plan, but they also influence the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=180)|
| 0:03:09| You know, as we're working on these areas, there's areas that need to get reasons, then those that could particular potentially need plan updates. And that's how that would influence the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=189)|
| 0:03:20| And so going into the one year plan specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| And looking at what it is, it's basically a plan to ensure that the future zoning conforms to the community's comprehensive development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=204)|
| 0:03:33| As I said earlier, you know, the zoning and and the one year plan the zoning and the sector plan and then sector plan, the one year plan, all those things have to be consistent with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=213)|
| 0:03:41| So the one year plan and the land use and the sector plan are basically a land use map and they have the different land use classifications that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=221)|
| 0:03:50| And each of those allows a certain set of zones within them. And so if someone has to wants to work on a project, they need to rezone their property. If it's not in a zone that's allowed in one land use class, they might need to get a planned amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=230)|
| 0:04:03| And to a land use classification that would allow their zoning. And so those are done by request to her by the planning commission and then city council after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=243)|
| 0:04:15| And so the purpose of the one year plan is to strengthen the relationship between planning and zoning. Again, they've got to complement each other and be consistent. And so in that way, the one year plan forms the basis of zoning within city limits and serves as a guide for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=255)|
| 0:04:29| Our objectives each year and we're doing these annual one year plan updates is to improve the consistency between the one year plan and sector plans and in some instances, the zoning as well and then communicate conflicts through online mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=269)|
| 0:04:44| So in looking at what's changed in 2021 there were some changes made to the report draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| Every year we have a staff proposed amendments table. This is where we've gone through and looked at the conflicts between the sector plan and one year plan where they don't complement each other and we come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=291)|
| 0:05:02| The proposed amendments table to bring these back into compliance. And then this year we've got some zoning conflicts for addressing or that we're just, I guess, informing the public about and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| The land use classification table section has a minor change. There are some resources that are available on our website. You probably saw these if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=311)|
| 0:05:22| Logged in through our website. And those are a list of revisions that's available that will show you where to look within the draft for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| Those changes that we're making. And we also have a track to changes document that's available upon request that will show you what last year's chain plan said and how we're changing that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=330)|
| 0:05:41| And then there's the mapping application websites and that's basically looks like this down here. We'll get into that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| This you can use in tandem with the draft to kind of look at the different conflicts and get more information about them. They kind of go hand in hand together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=348)|
| 0:05:56| So to give you an example of that will look into the staff proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| And so these are the sectors that had different conflicts with the one year plan. There was only one in Central City. There were five in East City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=360)|
| 0:06:10| To a northeast county and one in West County. So he wanted to look up the Central City one. For instance, you could go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| The draft go down to Chapter three against the list of revisions tells you exactly where to go within the plan to find what's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=378)|
| 0:06:27| And so you'll see across this row. This is the address of the properties that were affected. This is the current land use designation. This is what we're proposing to change it to. And this is a description of why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=387)|
| 0:06:38| And also the city council district is available here, but this amendment number on the website. This corresponds goes back to that mapping application that I told you about. So, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=398)|
| 0:06:50| You know, is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| Why it's not bringing up my internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| Okay, sorry guys. So from our one year plan website, you can just click on this number on this button view maps and that will bring you to our mapping application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=418)|
| 0:07:09| And so these are the different tabs that you have available right now we're looking at the one year plan staff amendments, the staff proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| And so if you click on number three up here will bring you to that property. And so, again, just toggling between the drafts. It's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 802 and 800 South Central streets and then you can see down here, it's 80| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=436)|
| 0:07:46| So it's a little more interactive. You can look at it mapping wise to see what's around it, the different land use designations that are there. This information within here is the same information that's in the table. It's just that this is a map form. It might be easier for you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=466)|
| 0:08:04| And so that's basically how you use the map to kind of find where all of these are. If you want to have more information about them. And if you still have questions, you can contact me through the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=484)|
| 0:08:15| My information is posted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| Kind of coming down into chapter four. This was the zoning conflicts. So last year with the one year plan update, council voted to make two changes to the land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=499)|
| 0:08:35| One change was to remove the R and three zone from the LBR or low density residential land use classification group. And so when that occurred, it resulted in some zoning conflicts with the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=515)|
| 0:08:51| And so this is just a list of these to make it available in case anyone has any questions or wanted to see if their property was affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| There were too many of these to map and make available on an individual basis as we have for the others. So this is basically a description of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=539)|
| 0:09:09| Where you can find it. And so let's kind of zoom in a little bit on this one. So if you wanted to find 5211 Pocahontas Drive, you could do that in KGIS in that tool or you could come on to our website here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=549)|
| 0:09:29| This is the last had to be close to reclassification conflicts. And so those are all here mapped in a general way. And so you can either go to KGIS and type in the address or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=569)|
| 0:09:44| The intersection that's provided or you can come here. If you want to look at it in your neighborhood. So you live around in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| And you wanted to see if there was anything going on around you, you could zoom in on it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| And so you can pull up the conflicts. And if you click on it, it'll tell you what the one year plan designation is and also the zoning district. So this is telling you that it's the LVR land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=595)|
| 0:10:07| And the reason that it's a conflict is because the LVR zone no longer allows the RN three. And so we've mapped the these particular ones because the increase was pretty significant. We felt that was worth passing along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=607)|
| 0:10:21| So to give you an idea, um, you know, typically each year we we define the number of conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| And the number of acreage. However, what we found is that, um, when you're looking at these conflicts, sometimes they will incorporate more than one parcel. And so it's hard each year to compare number of conflicts each year because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=628)|
| 0:10:44| You know, it might look like you have less conflicts, but you might not have more parcels that are affected. So this year we looked at the number of properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| And so with that change to the land use designation or the land use classification table, there were 3392 properties that were affected by pulling the RN three zone out of LVR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=652)|
| 0:11:03| And 2202 properties that were affected by pulling the RN five zone out of the MBR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| Just to give you an idea of of what that means in the big scheme of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| Looking at the zoning conflicts for all of the zones, including our entry and our and five it affected 11,836 properties with 1914 total conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=675)|
| 0:11:26| So you can see that the combination of these two zones make up almost half of all the zoning conflicts. So again, it was just significant enough that we felt like we wanted to, um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=686)|
| 0:11:37| Needed to kind of pass that along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| And then the final change that we made to the draft was an introduction to the land use classification table. This was brought back from the 2019 draft with a few minor edits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=700)|
| 0:11:51| And basically brought it back to clarify and emphasize the fact that it's zones inclusion on that list of allowed zones within that land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=711)|
| 0:12:00| Doesn't necessarily mean that all the zones listed are appropriate for given property and that the planning commission and city council should recommend that approve the best zone within that conforming range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=720)|
| 0:12:12| So, um, again, just bringing that back from past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| And so for additional information again, that website that you found the link to this meeting on you can use that to access all of the tools that we just went into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=736)|
| 0:12:27| There's a contact staff button on the website. My information is on the website. You can always email me and we do coming soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=747)|
| 0:12:36| We have a submit comments similar to how you would submit something to the planning commission to comment or question or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| So those are the three ways that you can get a hold of me. And if you have anything you would like clarification on, I want to discuss anything or just send some general comments and feedback on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=763)|
| 0:12:55| So with that, I will open it up to any questions anyone might have and, um, start that part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=775)|
| 0:13:05| If you guys do want to ask a question, you can click on the participants tab at the bottom, and it'll bring up a list of everyone that's present. If you click on the very bottom, it'll say raise hand. If you raise your hand, we'll be able to see you and I need you to let you make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=785)|
| 0:13:23| Also, I'll ask Amy Brooks, the director or interim director of planning, if you have anything you'd like to add, if there's anything I didn't cover that you think would be worth mentioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=803)|
| 0:13:33| No, Michelle, I think you did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| I don't see any hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Also, I'll ask Amy Brooks, the director or interim director of planning, if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=819)|
| 0:13:48| anything you'd like to add, if there's anything I didn't cover that you think would be worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| mentioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| No, Michelle, I think you did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| I don't see any hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| Okay, well, this was a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| It's my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Okay, hi, Janice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Hi, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| In the past, there has been three or four conflicts, one-year planned conflicts in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=849)|
| 0:14:19| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| It seems to me, I remember, I know that they're, have they just all been resolved or are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| no longer conflicts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| I think that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Go ahead, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| I was going to ask if you knew of anything specifically, so let's see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| Yeah, specifically, there was something over in the Colonial Village area off Stone Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| that was an industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| There was also, I think it was going down toward the river on South Haven, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| that was used to be R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| I'm not sure what it is now, but it seemed to me like that that was in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| And I may be confusing the one-year plan with another plan, but it seemed to me like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| was one-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Yeah, we didn't cover the zoning conflicts specifically because there's just so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| And that's kind of, you know, we went through and we adopted this great, this new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| ordinance that we have, but in some cases it resulted in some conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| And these will be resolved as we get back into the sector plan updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| Those conflicts will get handled during that time, and then one-year plan amendments will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| be made as part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| And so that would kind of take care of the zoning conflicts little by little as we update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| the sector plans that are mapped here, but we didn't go into them in the draft plan or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| have specific maps to them, because there's quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| I did take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| What is the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Is there a plan in place for the, especially since the new city ordinance went in play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| last year, what is the plan for any sector plan amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| The updates, like the big general updates, you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Yeah, Janice, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| It's been on our work program to update the, all the sector plans, but there's also been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| some initial discussion about potentially updating the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| So we do plan on updating the plans in some form or fashion over the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| So we have a lot to tackle in terms of, you know, the ideas to update all of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| So it is our intent to, you know, to get that started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| And I think COVID has had a part in that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| It's a lot harder to have these kind of public meetings and get a lot of public interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| when you can't meet in person and kind of go to those sectors to meet with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| I just know that it's, it's important, especially after the ordinances had gone through, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1022)|
| 0:17:10| some of these sector plans, it's been quite a while since they have been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| And just, I know that from my time on planning commission, that workload is really heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| and I, and I get it and I understand and appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| So a lot of things to do and you guys are doing a good job with putting things in priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| We're definitely eager to get started on the long range planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I see Sondra Korblick has her hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| I apologize for being so ignorant, but I don't really quite understand the relationship between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| the one year plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| I was thinking that the one year plan would dictate when you can make changes to the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| But from your discussion, it seems like the other outliers influenced the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| I'm just basically extremely confused and I hope you can explain this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I will try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Let me go back up to the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| So the one year plan and sector plan are very, very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| They both have land use maps and the land use maps are, for the most part, very consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| As you saw, we only had the nine conflicts between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| And so in that way, they look very similar and they have the same land use classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| The difference is that the one year plan also has, and I'll open up the PDF here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| It's got, I'll just kind of go through it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| So chapter one, here's kind of the introduction of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| It kind of talks a little bit about what we have, introduces the sectors, those kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| And then it has a section on, it's chapter three, no, chapter two, it's development policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1143)|
| 0:19:12| And so the sector plans don't really have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| The sector plans have the land use classification as an appendix in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| The one year plan has it in the body of the document, and it kind of goes into some detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| here with what land uses you can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| And it also, as part of this chapter, has, it'll be down a ways, more specific land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1165)|
| 0:19:40| Now I'm going super fast, sorry, don't make everybody dizzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| Okay, so it's also got specific uses and some criteria for those which the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1191)|
| 0:19:51| And so in that way, they're kind of different in terms of development policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Obviously, the sector plans are much broader because there's 12 of them and they're county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| wide, so it covers a much broader swath of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| But in terms of the land use maps themselves, they're very, very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| So I think that causes confusion for a lot of people because when you see rezonings coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| through in the city, you change one, you change the other, and they're usually the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| going to the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| And that's probably why it's a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| But does that help answer your question at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Well, my following question, it might be a tiny bit awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| And so I'll make it a rhetorical question that you're not stuck on answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| But wouldn't it be easier to use the one year plan data as a resource and simply have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| sector plan and you don't need to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| But it just seems confusing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| What do you mean use the one year plan data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| I think she's talking about the redundancy in the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| But don't answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| We're not going to put you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| I'm just kind of wondering out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| And thank you so much for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1263)|
| 0:21:12| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| So a lot of this information was posted very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| So I'm sure people that are on the meeting today haven't had much of an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| kind of go through and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| So if you don't have comments today, you can always comment later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| As for the timeline, it's not going to the planning commission until March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| See, March 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| So, um, March 11th at 1 30 planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| It will be on that agenda and then again in City Council, April 6th and 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| So there's plenty of time to go through all these changes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| We tried to make it easy by providing that list of revisions where you can find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| And again, the tracking changes document is available by request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Um, you can contact me to get more information if you have questions, comments, questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| and we'll take those all the way up to the planning commission and even after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| But ideally, by the time we have the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1325)|
| 0:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Well, I guess if no one else has any questions, then we'll go ahead and close out today's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| meeting and feel free to contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Could I ask something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210128-one-year-plan?start=1343)|
