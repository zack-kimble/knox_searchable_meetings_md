| 0:00:30| Commissioners, it's 11.32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| We'd like to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| There's a few folks on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| Appreciate the city staff being with us this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=37)|
| 0:00:41| Brian and Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Who's on Zoom, Dori?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| Yes, Jeff, we have Commissioner Hill and Commissioner Boyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| and Mike Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| And Liz is, of course, because she's sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| The purpose of the workshop is to review amendments to CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| and CG3, City of Knoxville Zoning Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| Ordinance, I've got to get them correct here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| Ordinance Code, so I'll learn on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| Primarily last month, or was it 60 days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| we had a review of these proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| and we decided to post all opponent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| and have a special workshop to discuss these codes amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| And Amy Brooks, who is now with the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| and our planning staff will lead us through the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| and try to give a little bit more background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| and respond to any more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| related to the purpose of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| So I'm going to turn it over to Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| And you do have a memo in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| distributed in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| Good afternoon, everyone, or morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| It's still morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Yes, in front of you, you have the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| that was drafted for the August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| the one that you all considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| It was discussed at agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| and it was at that time that it was determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| that you all wanted to have a little more conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| So as Jeff said, that's the purpose of this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| And Liz and Mike are both going to help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| We have a very simple presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| that I'm going to walk through and give you some background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| show you some examples that might be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| and then answer any questions that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| Go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Okay, so a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| How did we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| How did this conversation about CG 2 and 3 even come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| It actually came out of the recode stakeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| committee process, and it was then talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| after the new zoning ordinance was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| as an item that needed to be reconsidered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| the application or potentially the over-application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| of the CG 2 and CG 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| specifically along some of our major corridors in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| And a lot of this is in your memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| but I think it's just important to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| I think we're having a little bit of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Advancing slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| But again, this background is on the front page of your memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| So the purpose of the CG district is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| for a heterogeneous mix of retail, personal service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| office residential uses along our major commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| And in our nodes, it's intended to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| in a more of a pedestrian-oriented environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| Sorry, I'm hearing an echo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| And offer flexibility in uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| The district itself is divided into three levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| So you have a CG 1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| And really, the difference is not in the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| They're all the same across all the levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| but the difference is the intensity related to the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| and the design of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| and the placement of those buildings on individual parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| We talk a lot about Build 2 zones and Build 2 percentages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| and this is really at the heart of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| related to the CG 2 and CG 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| A Build 2 zone, and this can be found on Table 5.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| but it's also in your memo in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| The Build 2 zone is the area measured on a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| measured parallel from the front and or corner side lot line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| where the structure must locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| within a minimum and maximum range of the setback provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Again, it's to provide some context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| some relationship of that building to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| and intended to, you know, be dimensional standards found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| in areas that are intended to be more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| So Build 2 percentage, again, they're very similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| but it specifies the percentage of the building facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| that must be located within that Build 2 line or Build 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| And, you know, just for reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| the minimum Build 2 percentages in the CG 2 is 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| and it's 70% in the CG 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| We have just some local examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| of sort of how buildings relate to our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| These three examples, I think, that we have are along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| You all might recognize this Madewell building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| and it's relatively new in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Adjacent to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| The next one is also on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| a little bit on the other side of the road, closer to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| But this building is set back almost exactly 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| from the right-of-way line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| and the building is within the Build 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| It's almost exactly 50% of the max building width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| Amy, can you, just for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| this one is an example of CG 1, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| The zoning on this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| I actually don't know what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| I didn't reference the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| I was thinking about the building and the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| I think it might be CG 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| I'm just trying to get a map in my brain of these as models for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| This would be an example of a CG 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| CG 2, CG 3 is what we're specifically talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| In terms of its relationship to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| The Build 2 line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| OK, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Actually, this is really helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| because in my head I was thinking that the CG 2 and CG 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| were examples that would be not this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| This looks very conducive to walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| because of how it's closer to the street and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| OK, were you thinking that the CG 2 and CG 3 would be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| I mean, it allows a lot greater height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| But in the CG 1, there is no requirement for the Build 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| Build 2 zone, Build 2 percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| That's not a requirement as of the CG 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| So you really get the protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| protection speaking from the pedestrian standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| or trying to build that kind of walkability node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| with CG 2 and CG 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Yeah, and when it was originally talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| during the update to the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| it was a trade-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Hey, we'll let you go higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| You can build larger buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| but you really need to site them within a certain...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| You have to place them on the parcel itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| to be more pedestrian-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Would you say Cumberland Strip, the way it's developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| is more of an example of CG 2, CG 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| In terms of heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| What about development closer to the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| It's definitely closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| It's a different code altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| I mean, it's the form code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| I think there's some opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| for improvement along Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| We've heard some concerns about development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| and the scale at which that corridor is developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| But yes, I mean, potentially yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| You could, in the CG 2, CG 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| develop that close to the road, to the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Amy, could you go back to the Madewell building, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| the previous slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| You're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| Oh, no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| We're having a little trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| with the advancement of the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Okay, so with that particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| that's not a standalone building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| That is really part of a larger development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Would it comply with the current zoning now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| I'd have to look at where it's currently zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| I mean, it's not 50%, let alone 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Because most of the building is set back from Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| and you've got parking there in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| Yeah, I mean, there's a buffer along the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| I'm not sure when this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| do you all remember when it was permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| It was pre-, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| It was permitted before the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| So that now probably wouldn't be permitted, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| That development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| There would be elements of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| that wouldn't be permitted currently, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Peter Spaken said no, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| You know, and I've had these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| with Amy in the past and with Gerald, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| My concern with all this is the location of the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| Location of what, Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Who wants to walk on any arterial or any collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| on the sidewalk is six inches from the edge of the traveled lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| and that's what we're dealing with here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| and what we have all over Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| and probably most other arterials in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| I know we're not supposed to be getting into this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| No, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| We'll get into that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| My issue is that those need to be set back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| with at least a strip of a minimum of three feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| and possibly more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| and then the sidewalk itself needs to be six to eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| I mean, you can barely get two people walking on that sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| and if you want to really focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| on making it a pedestrian-oriented way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| all those elements have got to be put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| to make it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Just the orientation of the building is not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Anyway, that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| And these are really good discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| I have some additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| related to the analysis and walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| so if you want to, well, we can get back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| unless you have a specific question about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| but we have an opportunity for discussion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Well, it's related to sidewalks, if we're going to go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| I mean, it's like if you were to build a new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| in the build-to zone of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| or you go all the way to zero or right away, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| or the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| is there a requirement to be, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| would it be right up on the current existing sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| I guess I'm thinking of if you build a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| you know, how can we expand a sidewalk in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| if it's right on the sidewalk and the sidewalk's only three feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Yeah, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| That's come up as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| So let's keep going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| and then we'll have some additional conversation about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| because, again, it's not just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| There's so many things related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| This is not specifically just to the code itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| but some things that we looked at...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Next slide, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| ..as part of this analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Again, this is all in the memo, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Is the corridor linked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| So these, specifically, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| in the memo on the fourth page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| are the corridors that have been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| to where the Build 2 percentages and Build 2 zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| would not apply on properties that are zoned CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| So we did look at these corridor links.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| We looked at their classification, their major arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| We looked at existing constraints of certain sections of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| and then what makes an element of a walkable district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| and then some new information that's come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| in our conversations with TBO staff and city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| is roadway improvements on Chapman Highway and Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| related to multimodal projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| So, again, this is just a definition from the 2018...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| Next slide. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| ..of what a major arterial...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| The purpose of it is to provide movement within an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| provide intercommunity connections to the local street system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| and move traffic between activity centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Access control is desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| On the next slide here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| we talk about elements of what makes a walkable district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| So this kind of gets into what Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| was just discussing, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| the building in itself and the location of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| and having a sidewalk doesn't make a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| a place that someone would want to be and someone would want to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| So, you know, thinking about space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| is there a greenway or sidewalk that allows for adequate space to walk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Is there separation between the sidewalk and high speeds of traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| In particular, along these major arterials is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| Does the space feel safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| And that goes into, is there a buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Are there a lot of driveway crossings that someone would have to navigate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| Is there an opportunity for removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| or providing some type of alternative access to and from the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| You know, is there an opportunity for on-street parking or bike lanes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| Is the space a comfortable place to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| not just from a safety perspective, but just from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| we live in East Tennessee, it gets very hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Are there trees? Is it shaded? Is it connected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Are there a mix of uses surrounding those developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| that someone can walk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Obviously, all of these major corridors have bus access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| but are there places that people feel safe walking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| in the general vicinity, in close proximity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| So, it seems like the way that you're describing this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| it's a chicken and egg sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| because while not all of these ingredients may be present in a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=876)|
| 0:14:45| some of them may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Making decisions about the corridors in total like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| some of them may have great opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| but until one more piece of that puzzle is in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| no one can really see them or take advantage of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| But if we don't start laying that groundwork through the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| then we're missing the opportunity to build more walkable areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| Yes, absolutely, you can look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| I think most things in planning are, okay, you have a long vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| How do we want these places to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| But is it realistic to expect an entire corridor to develop out this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Or should there be more incremental approaches to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| fostering areas that are more walkable, that are more pedestrian friendly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Yes, all those things come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| I'm thinking about the case that we saw a few months ago on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| across from Barnes and Noble, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| where the planning staff was noting, like, this is a node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| We want this to be a more walkable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| We were trying to make decisions based upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| But there was some disagreement, like, will this area ever be walkable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| And, like, I was stating what someone else had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| That wasn't my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| But so when you've got that kind of, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| disagreement on what is the potential of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| it seems like that's what we're starting to cast the die for with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| corridors, saying that this area doesn't have the potential for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| or this area does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| I'm kind of thinking out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| I think that's the conversation that you all need to have today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| is make those types of determinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Commissioner, as the area that you pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| one of the reasons staff had identified that parcel that you all discussed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| few months ago was because it was part of the long-range plan for that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| to develop out as a higher density mixed-use center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| That's what we were pointing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| So the plan had, that vision had been placed in the plan there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Let's see, where were we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Chapman Highway Roadway Projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| This is a partnership between TDOT and Citi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I don't have a lot of information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| I do know that they're going to do multi-modal facility all the way to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| There is more information forthcoming that I'm sure will be presented to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| I don't know if, Jeff, you have anything else to add at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Not necessarily, that there will be on both sides of the roadway a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| multi-use path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| So that's the concept for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| There may be sections where it just may not exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| particularly where the walk wall, sort of the little, not tunnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| but the canyon that you drive through there going south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| that may be something where it's really much more constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| But the intent is to have multi-modal paths the entire distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| at least down to John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| But the devil's in the details, and that's, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| it's going to be a long-term plan of implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| And as Amy indicated, too, our sector plans and that identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| walkable areas, or at least focus areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| that we want to be able to create these nodes of walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| Similar to like the Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Yeah, and so the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| you all received a presentation on this one some time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| but the Kingston Pike roadway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| We just highlight this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| I just want you all to have all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| We don't have roadway projects for all the individual corridors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| were identified as part of this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| but this is just another one that there's significant improvements to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| Kingston Pike and North Shore that are underway that include turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| lanes, slip lanes, and improved crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| You know, I think what we were talking about in the comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| were made about that corridor, and it may have been me that made the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| comments or maybe Tim, you know, that area from there all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| through Bearden is just not conducive to walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| It's not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| And when recode went through there, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| when it recoded everything, anybody that starts something new is held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| to a higher standard than the people on the right or left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| Which just doesn't make a lot of sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| to blanket recode an area like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| because it's just nobody's walking there anyway, nor will they be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| I wouldn't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| I work over there, and I walk over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Okay, so there is one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| And I also think that that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| I'm not saying no one does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| I'm just saying it's just not a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| The thing that I would say argues in its favor to be a walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| opportunity is that there are so many places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| businesses like utility that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| So whether it's a donut shop or a dry cleaner's or a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| but there are things that people can actually go and do on foot that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| they need to go and do, and there are greenways that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| surrounding it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| So it does start to have many of the ingredients for a walkable sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| But right now, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Like, it's a very car-centric zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| So it seems like there's a vision in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| And how do we continue to add more ingredients to that to make it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| walkable place that is desired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Amy, if you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| can you continue your presentation and go down to the map in item C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1237)|
| 0:20:48| and explain why these areas that do not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| or you guys are proposing it not be included in the build-to zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| why you started there and stopped there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| and why you would give these other parts that are a little more urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| an opportunity to do what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Can you give us some background on where we're starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| and then that way we can kind of build off that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| Because I'm in agreement with Karen and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| I mean, I think that we need to push areas that are conducive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1284)|
| 0:21:32| pedestrian traffic for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| And I think that's what's going to make Knoxville unique as it caters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| to folks that think they're coming to Knoxville for an outdoor experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| and more of an urban user-friendly area, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| But at the same time, we all know we've gone through COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| and commercial businesses have just changed in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| And you don't have the employment base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| There's been restaurants that have just completely shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| having people come inside the doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| and it's just all drive-through facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| So I think as employment changes and uses change and businesses change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| I think we need to allow the market to dictate somewhat in parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| how it's going to utilize the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| I wouldn't want to be so restrictive on all these corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| that you can't allow for that market flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| But I do want to make sure that we highlight the areas that we do want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| to encourage this pedestrian activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| We can't pull up the memo that you all have, but Liz has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| If we want to zoom in, she's got KJS open here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| But let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| In your packet under the highlighted section, there's a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Again, it's kind of challenging to see at that scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| but the areas that were identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| these are sections of the major arterials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| where the Build 2 percentages and Build 2 zones would not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| Again, and remember, this came out of a request originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| from the stakeholder group for the update to the code of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| hey, we want you to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| We think this might have been over-applied, the CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| And so that's where this comes out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| And so this is like, okay, well, if it was over-applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| these are areas that we might want to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| because they're currently very auto-dominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Is this, and they are primarily out of that inner ring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| of the core of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| The likelihood of them, you know, developing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| with larger scale buildings any time in the near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| is probably, you know, somewhat slim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I'm not going to guess on what that timeframe might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| But again, so thinking about their current state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| and the opportunity that exists in the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| that would still keep those Build 2 percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| and Build 2 zones is pretty great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| So North Broadway, which is north of Ridgewood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Hopefully some of you are familiar with these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Chapman Highway, south of Young High Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| Asheville Highway, east of Prosser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Kingston Pike, west of Westwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| And South North Shore Drive, east of Witover Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| Again, going back to that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| about what makes an area pedestrian friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| the chicken and the egg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| just because you have a building close to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| is not going to make it walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| There's a whole lot of other factors to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| There's a whole lot of other policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| that we probably should be looking at as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| to foster more pedestrian activity in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| It's not just the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| The zoning code obviously is an important piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| It does influence how communities develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| But again, it's one piece of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| Chris, I'm not sure if I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Amy, a quick question for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| and for also those in the development community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| you know, Chris, John, or Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| You know, what, four, five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| we changed the zoning to allow residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| multifamily, high-rise in commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Now, to date, we haven't seen the fruits of that labor yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| But I think in the future, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| I mean, I guess my question is, how viable is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| I mean, we look at Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| we look at Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| and they're all pretty much segregated as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| That's the way they've always been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| That's the way we looked at zoning for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| Now, we're looking at more integration of land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| And so, you know, my personal hope is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| a lot of these areas that we currently see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| are heavily dominated by commercial establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| will be more multi-use and more probably higher-rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| hopefully higher-rise residential multifamily type stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| So that, I think, is going to affect, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| how we look at pedestrian orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| Because those people living in those high-rise units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| will want to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| There'll be greater densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| so businesses that can accommodate that kind of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| will flourish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| And you look at, for example, Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| and you've got Copper Cellar that is closing or sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| That's going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| A lot of the fast-food places have gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| They're not really geared for that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| The land's too expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| and they're using a lot of the area for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| and for drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| So those are kind of fading away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| So, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| I'm just throwing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| You know, do we expect to see in the next 20, 30, 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| more higher-density residential along our corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Keep in mind the way that the amendment is drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| it doesn't prohibit development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| within those designated Bill 2 percentages, Bill 2 zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| It just adds additional flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| where a developer wouldn't have to adhere to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| but they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| The stakeholder committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| have they been continuing to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| And has this been a new thing that's been brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| or was this identified closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| to the implementation of recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| No, that group sunset in January, I believe, of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| This was one of the outstanding items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| that was sort of one of the last ones to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| So was it, I guess, this could have been something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| that was identified early in the recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| It just hasn't been tackled yet as...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| No, I mean, the CG3 and CG...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| I mean, there's a debate about what these corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| should look like, the zoning along them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| but yeah, this was identified as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| for planning and city staff to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Is this, the application of CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| the question is, has it been over-applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Does it need to be refined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| And that was a direction to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| a planning commission needs to consider this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| and if they do think there needs to be changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| that would need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| it would go forward to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| as a recommendation from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Okay, I guess I'm trying to think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| when this was maybe initially brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| Oh, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| I don't know exactly when it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| I mean, because they started meeting in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| so it's been a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| So I guess my point is maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| is this something that's been brought up as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| oh, we see this as potentially being a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| and we've never tackled it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| but also recode's been in effect for multiple years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| and like, has it been an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| now that recode's been in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| I think part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| and correct me if I'm wrong, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| you probably know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Tim Hill, are you in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Can we hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| We had a huge discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I think a lot of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| especially along the Kingston Pike corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| was during recode changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| and it wasn't equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| So when people started coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| and wanted to change or do a new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| they couldn't do what they already had there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| or they couldn't recreate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| because of the change in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Am I correct there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| That they couldn't correct it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| in terms of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1779)|
| 0:29:52| Are you muted, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| Is the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| It might be on his end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1800)|
| 0:30:13| It was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Tim, can you unmute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| How about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| You're muted now, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| We have to mute the host while Tim talks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1839)|
| 0:30:48| Commissioner Hill, can you try now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| You can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Okay, Tamara, maybe I can talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| I can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Hey, Tim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| you see your little mute button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| on the bottom left corner of your Zoom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| We can hear you both now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Oh, you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| So, Jeff, what was your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Well, we were talking about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| He was asking about what precipitated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| all this discussion about the CG along Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| and, you know, the changing of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| And if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| there was a lot of discussion about, after recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| that the property along these corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| was rezoned, if you will, or recoded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| And the way they were recoded had different requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| maybe more restrictive requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| than they originally had on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| which prevented them from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| If they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Okay, so they had a laundromat close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| and they wouldn't put a restaurant there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| they could no longer do that where they could have prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Am I on base there, off base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| somewhat correct or incorrect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Do you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| You're saying that by pulling the buildings up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| that restaurants are having trouble...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Under the new codes, they would have to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| and it was changing their rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| One, you're going to have trouble with drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| It's hard to circulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| When you have a six to 10 foot front landscape area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| and you have to build to zero to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| you don't have enough circulation around the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| And Amy showed two examples earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| The two story there across from Madewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| that building does not comply because it has front parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| And the only reason that building could be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| is because the adjacent property is commonly owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| Otherwise, they couldn't access that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| So there are a number of things that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| to make sure that we're cognizant of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| One is TDOT has relatively new access standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| where you must be 20 feet off your neighbor's property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| for your curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| And if you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I would love for somebody to do a 100 foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| place a building on it, place the landscape on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| and then try to put a drive-thru on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| I don't think you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| And then if you look at that grocery store there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| at that major intersection of North Shore and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| we just need to be aware that it'd be very problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| to do grocery stores in CG2 or CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| because you cannot park in the front of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| and you have tractor-trailers delivering dunnage and garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| and all sorts of other services going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| behind the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| So those are a lot of the challenges that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| So it's not just whether we can make it walkable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Can the building function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| I know we had this discussion with Recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| and I think it seems like most of those grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| in these type of developments, they have a back entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| Isn't that right, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| They have a what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| They'll have a rear entrance to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| to people who park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| They do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| So they would be entering in through the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| You've probably seen this in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| where they come in through the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| as opposed to entering in through the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| where the parking in the back is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| and that's maybe not the main entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| but it's the most accessible entrance for cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| And then the other thing with Recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| and I just want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| the previous zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| you were very limited to your uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| I mean, I think one of the real benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| that developers have with Recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| is that they have now the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| to develop these properties as residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| or they have a lot of flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| to develop it as whatever they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| and while they may have some restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| regarding on this Bill 2 line and parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| they can do a lot of things with their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| that they were not able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| under the previous zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| When we have, like, a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| that goes out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| or a laundromat in this hypothetical example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| or some sort of, when the use changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| what are the triggers for when it becomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| you know, a renovation turns into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| like, a new construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Is it the 50% of the value deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| Or, you know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Mr. Ahrens, would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| In terms of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| You deal with this quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| You know, when these buildings go vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| and they're looking to be repurposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| how much of a hurdle is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| to avoid having to rebuild entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| versus, yeah, I think you get my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2176)|
| 0:36:25| There's a couple of thresholds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| The one that we address predominantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| is as it relates to parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| and that's based on a threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| of the monetary value of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| and the percentage that's invested into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Once they hit that threshold of 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| that's when...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| And we don't need to go down that tangent too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| but bringing parking lots into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| with the code is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| I'm looking for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| when those standards come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2223)|
| 0:37:13| What are you looking for, Pete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| In my mind, I'm thinking it's 30%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| additions of 30% or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| Okay, I can find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2245)|
| 0:37:37| So the design standards come into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| when you're adding on 30% or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| of the existing square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| As far as dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| I believe the nonconformity section would come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| which would be Article 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| And as long as you're not increasing the nonconformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| if you've got a building that sets too far back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| it just is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| It would be, I think, the only time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and Brian, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| but the only time we would force somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| to move the building forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| is if the existing building were raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| and they're essentially starting over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| Could I get some clarification on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| I heard someone mention landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Is there a required landscape buffer with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| Type A or type B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Unless it's a small lot, then there'd be six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| Yeah, it's under 12.8 buffer yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| Well, there's also site landscape requirements of 12.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2338)|
| 0:39:09| which is around the actual building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| and then there's buffer yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| that may or may not come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Yeah, I was thinking that buffer yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| are typically between lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| I'm trying to skim through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| but is there a buffer yard requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| between a right-of-way and a building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| In this case, apart from general landscape requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| Not between the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| That would be a site landscaping issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| and I think that's what Mr. Hill was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| or the site landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| the landscaping required around the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| that in conjunction with pulling the building up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| to the front of the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| there's a lot going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| Correct me if I'm wrong, Tim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| but I think that's what he was articulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| prevents circulation around the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| Is that what you were trying to say, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| It's really the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| I was just curious if there's a dimension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| associated with that landscape requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| if it's a type A or class A or class B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| or if there's a certain dimension to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2425)|
| 0:40:35| There is not a width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| but there is the requirement for landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| It articulates the plant species and numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| not species, but plant types and numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| but it doesn't get into the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| Wrong term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| It doesn't tell you how wide it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| It doesn't tell you what type of weed you can plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| There's also an alternative landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| that's used quite frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| that allows somebody to request alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| to where they place those trees and bushes and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| I was just looking at this corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| using the Kingston Pike from North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| up towards Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| and I'm looking on both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| Most, if not all, of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| save one or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| have parking between the road and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| And if you're talking about restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| and if we're talking about doing away with restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| but when we were working on Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| when they were redeveloping that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| and recode was taken on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| we heard several restaurant people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| that say they don't survive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| if the parking's in the back of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| if the restaurant's pulled up to the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| because people don't think they're open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| whatever it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| It just doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| that model doesn't work for a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| And those are, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| some things when we're talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| is the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| What are we going to build there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| What do we want to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| And walkability is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| I don't know necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| if a parking lot on the front of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| prevents all that as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| but pulling the building up to the front certainly does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| So, you know, for me it's a quandary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| of what works and what doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| and I think we have to listen to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| that are in the businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| what they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| what their requirements are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| that they've found to be successful in their careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| Correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| and this is just to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| I think off-street parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| has a 25-foot setback requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| front yard setback in all most districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| unless it's a multifamily dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| That 25-foot setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| is when it's adjacent to a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| That's only if it's adjacent to a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| Okay, so I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| So in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| there wouldn't be a front setback for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| so properties could have that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| In the CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| there's that build-to zone of zero to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| so you can't functionally get really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| you can't get a two-way drive aisle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| in front of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| because you've got your building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| and let's say you've got your 20-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| You've got to have some amount of landscaping there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| to get your trees and shrubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| plus you've got maybe a one-way drive aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| With 20 feet, you couldn't even get parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| And a one-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| There's no parking up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| There's no parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| When it comes to the restaurant idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| that putting it in the front doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| I think it's not been tested here, really, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| Well, we had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| On Sullivan Avenue, there was a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| The El Mezcal, or is it the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| What's it called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Are you talking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| What's that restaurant on the corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| I can't remember the name of the restaurant now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| but they actually were...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| The Burgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| No, this was a Mexican restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Oh, El Charro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| El Charro, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| It's been a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| and I've slept since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| so I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| The owners were asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| because it had been rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| and they were asking for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| because they needed up-front parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| And it was as important enough to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| to be a killer to redevelop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| to put a restaurant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| That was what they testified to us, in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| So I'm just using Anecdote 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| I've talked to several people that own restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| that feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Hey, Amy, this is definitely not the Tim Hill show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| but I think we're talking about practical applications of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| and I think the Bearden District would be a good example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| for all of us to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And so Tim is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| I guess, Tim, you're the president of the Bearden Council now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| has been through that whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| of how they want to see their corridor developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| and he also develops quite a bit along these major corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| being Chapman Highway, Kingston Pike, and otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| And so I would be curious just to hear from Tim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| as he's looking at developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Not all of his developments are national tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| that we may not want here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| He does local folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| That two-story building is a local entrepreneur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| that's got shirts and hats and all that sort of thing in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| So I'd be curious just to hear from Tim about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| It's really an unintended consequence risk in cutting too deep, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| And I just want to hear from Tim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| what he thinks about where this piece of business sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2795)|
| 0:46:45| I heard most of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| I hope I heard enough of it to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| You know, I think this ordinance is a good mid-range fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| for what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I think it's best to take these examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| and say CG2 and CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| we're basically taking downtown design to the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| That's exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| And so because of these TDOT highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| that bring so many challenges to this downtown-style development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| we can't understate the TDOT access standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| where they basically dictate where your driveway goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| which will severely impact when you pull the building toward the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| The fact that you can't park in front...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| And believe me, I'm all about walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| I'm sitting down here in probably the prototype| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| for the nation and the world, which is Seaside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| So I buy into walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| We have so many challenges along our major corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| our TDOT highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| and we have little cooperation with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| that it limits our ability to do these type of developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| and it limits our ability to do drive-throughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| and it limits the function of grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| So we have to concentrate on nodes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| like Holmberg is a great walkable node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| You could argue maybe Western Plaza could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| Sutherland area is a very walkable stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| But to say that we go across from Barnes & Noble west of West Town Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| where that's almost a regional-type use, it's just so problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| And I think I would certainly support this amendment on the CG2-CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2935)|
| 0:49:12| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| If not, I always like to leave you all with your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| So when this comes forward, as it will on your next agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| obviously you all know that you can recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| You can recommend denial of the amendment as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| You can make modifications to this proposed amendment to better suit what you think is best here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| You also can create a policy to guide staff recommendations for any requests to CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| There's a CG2 up here, but it should be CG2 and CG3 in the areas identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| So that could look like something like, hey, in these particular areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| we encourage staff to consider a rezoning to CG1, which allows all the same uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| but doesn't have the same dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| So that would be just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| You can also request city and planning staff to study this issue further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| So just wanted to leave you all with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| I know we talked a little bit about the map and where we were going to put these boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| You know, I know along Kingston Pike we're including west of Westwood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| but most of those properties along Kingston Pike west of Westwood Road are CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| So why is that being included in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| I can tell you why it's CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| No, but why are we including that as part of the boundary since it's not really applicable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3040)|
| 0:50:49| Well, it could be part of the, I mean, if they were rezoned, it could be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3049)|
| 0:50:57| But they're currently CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Let me pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Other than some of the places, is there, there's the, I mean, most of those properties are CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3063)|
| 0:51:11| There's a couple of them that are CG3 that are in the Homburg area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| Yeah, originally when it was, one of the first maps showed those areas as CG2, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| primarily at the request of community members, it was reverted back to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| But do we need that section being included in this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| I think the amendment says to stop at Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| It says everything beyond Westwood going west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Yes, thanks, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| In my opinion, I thought, I would think it should be moved further east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| Yeah, we talked about North Shore, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Didn't we talk about North Shore briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Well, North Shore is west of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| So if you're west of Westwood, you're inclusive of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| I think I threw out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| It would make sense to me that we would go up to Cemetery Drive or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| Amy, I think I threw out North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Because everything west of North Shore, there's not sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| But everything east of North Shore, there is along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| You said west of North Shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| West of North Shore, there's no sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| I do recognize this property gets developed along that corridor within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| They will be required to put in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| And then if you pull up that T-dot intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| it looked like that had a plan to put sidewalks in at least a few of the parcels west of North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3168)|
| 0:52:56| The proposal for Kingston Pike had sidewalks going just past the bank west of the intersection of North Shore and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3176)|
| 0:53:05| They couldn't do it and find a Krispy Kreme because there's parking and a wall, retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3185)|
| 0:53:12| You wouldn't be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| But I think with the school there, you know, especially, Bird Elementary is right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| that it would make sense for us to go ahead and push it to North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| Because if the mixed use does come to that area, which I'm hoping it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| there is going to be walking traffic and kids walking to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| You have the elementary school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| That's the commission's prerogative if they want to pull it to Kingston Pike or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| So we don't do anything now? We wait to a meeting to discuss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| And make an amendment then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| That would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| For any of the corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| For any of the corridors to extend them or alter them in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| That's right, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| This is for discussion, study, and if there are actual amendments that anyone wants to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| you would do that at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3248)|
| 0:54:18| The area on Broadway, does it just stop? It seems like a short section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| Is that just where the city stops and the county starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| Is that kind of at the line? Is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| No, there's still some city property up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Otherwise, we wouldn't have included it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| It's like five or six parcels that this excludes north of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| It's a small handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Yeah, it is a very small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| And while you're looking at that, Amy, completely information purposes, not deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| As we talked about Kingston Pike and where you started the property that would not be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| you started east of North Shore, I'm assuming because of the food city there and that shopping center there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| And if that shopping center ever added more than what Peter said, 30%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| that it would become nonconforming or whatever, and they'd have to move it and do a bunch of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| But is that why you started where you started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| I'd like to just get some more background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Context on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| That's the Rocky Hill area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| No, this is the one that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Oh, Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| Between North Shore and Westview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| You know, and as I look at this a little closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| I guess Westwood is kind of a cutoff between the Southern Avenue interchange and that Humber area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3343)|
| 0:55:52| So I guess it makes a little more sense to me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3352)|
| 0:56:00| Amy, how does the amendment for Kingston Pike there go inside with the Bearden plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3360)|
| 0:56:09| Well, I would argue as the zoning is currently assigned, it doesn't align with the Bearden plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3369)|
| 0:56:19| I mean, I think the Bearden plan talked about it being more of a node area there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| and the CG-1 doesn't necessarily encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| It does offer a mix of uses, but again, the height is fairly restricted under CG-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| Again, some of these plans are fairly dated, so the argument could be made that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| well, does that plan, is that still the direction the community wants to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| I would say, you know, when we were updating the map itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| we heard from the community that they didn't want to see the CG-2 and CG-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| and so that's why Director Green at that time assigned the CG-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3412)|
| 0:57:05| You know, personally, I'd like to see us do more planning instead of reacting to amendments like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3425)|
| 0:57:13| As you said, the Bearden plan may be a little outdated, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| but I know that there are other areas of the city that, along our corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| which seem to be the, have the biggest potential but also the biggest conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| that we need to look at more long-range planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| Maybe we start doing corridor plans on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| and hitting those areas that have the highest priority and doing as many as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| I think all we're doing is kind of chasing our tails now with this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| instead of looking at it on a longer-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| Mr. Ackerville, I agree, and I will say that both on planning and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| I will say that both on planning and the city's work program to move forward with planning work over the next year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3477)|
| 0:58:06| so you'll see more of that coming before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| Just make sure the city pays for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| Pays for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Okay, I'll make sure to let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| You'll pay for it, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| I just want to say one broad thing with this discussion and other discussions around walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| that I don't hear as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| A lot of times when we talk about walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| it seems like we're focused more on the people who live there, who might live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| or the people who might drive to a spot and then walk to another business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| which is very, very, you know, probably the majority of the walkable residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| But one thing that I think we should also be very mindful of is public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| And, you know, on major corridors, that's where public transit is some of the most used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| And so the people who are using public transit really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| really need to be able to get to the place that they're trying to go to very safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| And I also think aesthetic way, nobody wants to walk through a concrete desert to get somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3549)|
| 0:59:19| And I also think that even though public transit right now may not have the same widespread use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| if we look at future population growth and the amount of people that are expected to move to places like Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3567)|
| 0:59:36| from bigger cities and from other countries, I do think that public transit will become more and more used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| So thinking about what walkability, I think that areas like downtown and Bearden are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3582)|
| 0:59:51| really good case studies for the people who already live there or who are already there doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| But I also want to always be thinking about the people who may not have a vehicle or maybe just trying to utilize public transit to go about their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3598)|
| 1:00:09| So I just wanted to add that in for general thought with all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| I totally agree. And I also think one thing we talked about a lot during the RICO process was just the aging population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| and how, you know, at a certain point, all of us are not going to be able to drive anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| And some of the best places to live are in larger cities like New York or downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| where you can easily walk someplace as opposed to have to get in a car and drive somewhere and have those limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| I just want to add from a transit perspective, again, what Knoxville Area Transit is going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| we look at their transit routes and the way the KTA Transit Authority Board has directed their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| and our staff is leading that study is concentrate the service along the major corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| They want more service redundancy, i.e. more rapid service than coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3654)|
| 1:01:03| So put more of your resources on the Kingston Pikes, the Chapman Highways, the Western Avenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| where you can get 15-minute service and expect a bus instead of having one-hour service out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| in places where one-hour service does not do you any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| So they're going to be regrouping most likely, and there's a couple more reiterations of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| but that is where the direction that the KTA Board is directing staff to do is invest in the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| Like I say, if you get a grocery, or anyone who has to do that, and they have to walk 100 yards or 150 feet with groceries on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3692)|
| 1:01:40| it's difficult, and they have no ability to stand that is safe for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| So we have to look at that whole entire infrastructure to create walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| as well as building front setbacks and that whole nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| So it's complete packages, Amy and Lincoln indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| Is there anything else for today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| Do you want this on the agenda for October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| I don't know if we have time to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| It's scheduled to be on the agenda. We could always postpone it if you all want more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| We'd postpone it 60 days in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3739)|
| 1:02:27| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220913?start=3747)|
