| 0:07:59| a copy of the limited partnership, the building inspection approval, fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| prevention approval, and health department approval. Okay, and this is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=484)|

| 0:08:24| Yes. Okay, now, I know this is a new Walmart store, and a new prototype, and everything. Tell us about it, please. This is our small prototype. They've been around since 1998, but really not in this part of the country. There's about 700 of them total, company-wide right now. This will be the first in Knoxville, and this is actually a brand new prototype. So, we have a store in Sevierville opened last year, a couple in Morristown. So, if you've been in those, you've probably heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=504)|
| 0:08:52| If you've been in those, you're going to be surprised when you come in ours, because it is going to be drastically different. Larger buildings, larger expansion, unique items, deli, bakery, produce areas. It's a real focus on convenience, quick in and out. The building, just by the size of a super center, is about 25% of the size that you normally shop at at Walmart. So, it's going to be primarily focused on grocery, the fresh areas, and we do have a full pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=532)|
| 0:09:21| fuel on premise as well, which is actually operated by Walmart. That's unique. Most of our super centers are operated by third parties, known as Murphy USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=561)|
| 0:09:31| Okay. Well, I know that the people in the third district in that area are excited about the opening, and what's the projected opening date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| We're looking at late January right now. The date is not set in stone officially just yet, but late January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| Did we vote on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Okay. Now, the other application is for the fuel station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| And, we'll need to get, Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| Same store, just no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Okay. Ms. Day, what do we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, a limited partnership, the building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| Okay, and I move to approve, pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Usually, the Walmarts do not sell beer separately from the store, do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| They don't typically, because usually, again, if you have a fuel site on site at a super center, that is not Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| That is leased out to Murphy USA, so they do their own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| This will be much like our Sam's Club in that it will be run by Walmart on site, staffed by Walmart employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| Okay. All right. Well, thank you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| Sure. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| All right. Let's do the addendum, and then we'll come back to the people who were not here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| City Lights Bar and Grill on Sevier Avenue, began in July of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=650)|
| 0:10:59| Is there anyone here from that business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| We heard from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| We've not heard from them either, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| They still have three outstanding approvals? Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| They began in July of 2016, so it's been six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| So if we deny it, they can still come back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| I mean, denial on this doesn't mean a year's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| If you do not extend it, I mean, it dies, so they'd have to come back and reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| Can we table it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| We can table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| We can table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Yeah, I think I'd rather table it than kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| That way it's still pending, and they wouldn't have to reapply and go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| But, I mean, well, I'll make that motion we table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| All those in favor of tabling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| And I'll get a letter to them for Wanda to send that explains what is involved with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| Can we untable and approve in a second meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| They don't really need an approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| They just present the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| But we'd have to move to take it off the table and take it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| All right, next is extreme sports bar and grill on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| And they began this process on August the 16th, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| They completed their requirements and picked up their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=755)|

| 0:12:37| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| All right, next is the Weigels at 3815 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| This Weigels has had probably more tough challenges than almost any other Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| The soil was extremely toxic from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| So they finally have the soil situation resolved, and they actually are under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| So they have asked if we could extend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| How long did they ask for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Do you remember, Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Two months maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| It's got to be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| I believe it was to the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| I think they were opening in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Well, let's extend it for 60 days, and that will give them plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| They'll be able, if they get all the approvals, to come in and see Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| This is not a new procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| All right, 60 days I think is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Next is Socono Taco Cantina on Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| I don't see anybody here from them, but I know they're actually working and probably very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| I mean, I'll move to extend this to the next meeting in January, whatever that date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| January 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Well, let's go back and take in order those people who were moved to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Ichiban Japanese Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=845)|
| 0:14:15| I will move that we defer this to the January 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Pass them up here, boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| Next is the Kaya Korean Restaurant on Montague Center Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| Move we postpone until the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Next is the Knoxville Opera Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| Move we postpone this until the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| And then we've tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Ms. Day, would they have gotten a card or something saying be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| Very surprising because Don Townsend is usually, you know, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| But their event is not until April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Christmas intervened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| It's not until April, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| One piece of news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| I don't know if any of you saw the paper today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| but TABC has been audited for some of their processes on applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| and processing them and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| And it's not been a happy experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| And so today it was announced that applications for TABC permits will be electronic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| beginning soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Everything will be easier to track and follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| and they don't anticipate some of the previous problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| So that's good news, I guess, for TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| We will not be electronic with our applications soon, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| Isn't that right, ladies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| And a reminder that we have our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| We will be looking, among other things, at the pricing of the scanners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| The prices range from free to several thousand, so we'll have some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| And also look at some adjustments in fines and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Is there any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161220?start=975)|
