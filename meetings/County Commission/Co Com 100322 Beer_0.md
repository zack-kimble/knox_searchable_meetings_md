| 0:04:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Ma'am, is the permit that's there now, the license there now, is it for on and off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| The current permit license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| I thought that he had applied for on and off, but I know for a fact that it is for on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| For off only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| No, he serves it on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| I can say that I know for a fact that it is for on-premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| but I'm not confident in saying that it is for on and off-premises at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| So at the chatterbox, do you have a sit-down bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Just so we're sure, if I could, Mr. Chairman, Wolfie, UK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| are you knowledgeable as to the status of this license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Is it on and off both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| I'm almost sure when he came it was on and off, but I've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| I hope Mr. Brown brought that up, I've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| They build an outside shed on that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| and they can leave without anybody inside of seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| If we're going to have on-premise, it ought to be in the bar instead of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| when you issue on and off, they think they can go outside and pitch horseshoe and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=350)|
| 0:05:58| It's your all's decision, but that's what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| I'm not familiar with your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| What kind of, what type of business is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| It's, we just sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| Just a tavern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Yes, just a tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Why do you need off-premise as well as on-premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| Just, I mean, my understanding is if I want to sell like a six-pack to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| then I have to have an off-premises license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| And that is in the fact that they purchase the alcohol and they leave with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| Are you willing to take the liability of you serving someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| and then them sitting down for a beer after work and then you selling them a six-pack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| Are you willing to take that liability that comes with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| I've had a beer permit at another location at a restaurant and bar that I used to own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| And we had on and off-premises license there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| But it was in the CD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Where was it at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| It was Deuce's Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| I believe it's referred to as El Tanampa or something like that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| I just, I don't, I know it's the law and we can't vote against it because it's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| I'm uncomfortable with an on and off at a tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| It's your business and you operate it how you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| But I think you're accepting a huge responsibility and liability for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| because you're going to serve somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=448)|

| 0:14:04| Please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| Donna Dweck, 605.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Well, my current business is 509 Level Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| And this business will be on 605 Level Road ultimately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Hardy Davidson and I are doing a collaborative effort for a bike night for the next few during the spring and summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| And it's in their parking lot, which is two doors down from my current business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| So would it be safe to say you're seeking a temporary beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| And what would be the duration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| How many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| I actually can give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=878)|
| 0:14:47| It will be 12 events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Over a period of what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| From April 24th through September 22nd will be the final one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Those 12 events, how many events per event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| In other words, how many days per event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| If you say 12 events, is that one day per event or is that 12 days or 12 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| Actually, it's 12 different dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| And the first one is on Saturday from 4 to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| And then thereafter, each event is every other Wednesday from 6 to 9 p.m. only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=913)|
| 0:15:22| Do you currently have any kind of licensure from the state or the county, any kind of catering permit, beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| wine permit, liquor by the drink permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I was getting conflicting information from the state and then from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| You know, the county said I needed a county beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| The state said they really didn't have any jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| But if I wanted to get one, I still needed to go through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| So I talked to several people in both places, and no one was sure of who I needed to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=944)|
| 0:15:52| The health department said they had no problem with me preparing food down the street, you know, at my location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| and then transporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Now, what kind of business do you generally have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| It's the Prince Deli and Sports Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| It's an actual deli sports bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Okay, and do you have a beer license at that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| And I've carried one since 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| All right, if you give me a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Commissioners, what we have here is a bit unusual, but within the confines of all, it's essentially a temporary beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=972)|
| 0:16:20| Now, Tennessee state law does read if you have a specific kind of catering permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| you probably don't need a temporary beer permit, but you're within empowered to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| if you so desire and feel this is appropriate, issue a temporary beer permit for that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| In so doing, they would pay the normal fee, and they would come under the laws, rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| and regulations of the county commission if you so desire to issue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Apparently, it's in conjunction with a motorcycle dealership for special events for beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| She has a beer license for her static business, but she would need a temporary beer permit to do this off-site catering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1012)|
| 0:17:01| Before I go to the litany of questions, I think it's probably perhaps best to defer to the commission for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| So I guess the first question is to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| With what you just said, if we issued a blanket temporary beer permit, there's nothing to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1034)|
| 0:17:23| I'm not saying that she would do this, but there's nothing to restrict them from selling in times other than these 12 designated dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| She would sell during those days that she's provided those dates, and those dates only beer at the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1052)|
| 0:17:42| the specific location and on those specific dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| So we can set it up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| This part of Lovell Road, I travel a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| It's on the way home from Oak Ridge, and it's a good place to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Diesel pretty ‑‑ well, diesel's not inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| It was $2.92 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| But one thing I see is there's a lot of truck traffic in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| I mean, there's on both sides of the interstate, there's several major trucking stops, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| for not just for gas, but for service and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| So, you know, Harley Davidson and Prince Deli are kind of situated right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| and that traffic isn't very conducive to a lot of, I guess, motorcycle travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| So that's one thing that concerns me, the fact that we will be having bike night at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| doing evening hours when a lot of trucks are coming off the road, getting off the interstate for their nightly stops and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| So that location concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| So I guess my question is, what would you do to, you know, help alleviate that risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1132)|
| 0:19:00| I mean, not necessarily a concern for me, but for you it would be a risk for yourself and the Harley Davidson dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| I appreciate the question, and I can see your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| I think that it wouldn't be anything different than what's already normally going on, in all honesty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| because bikers travel in a lot of groups, especially on Saturday afternoons or Sundays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| or even during the evening hours, like on the pretty afternoons that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| So it's not unusual for me to get, even at my location a couple of doors down, five or six bikes at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| But this one's going to be, you know, I've been out and I'm a bike rider myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| I've been out to the Harley Davidson place off of Merrillville, out in Merrillville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| So you're going to increase that by a factor of ten or 20 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| So you'll have probably you're hoping to have a couple hundred bikes out there a night if you're successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| So that's increasing that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| I appreciate the vote of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| I think that Harley Davidson is really just trying to provide a way for more people to come through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| Like they're going to have their store open during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| and they're going to feel free to shop and they'll have a van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| So I think it's more like a casual neighborhood get-together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| I don't see it as being like a knock-down, drag-out kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| they may have a few beers and a sandwich or something like that and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| And most bikers are pretty responsible anyway because these bikes are not inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| But that's what I found being in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| And what are you specifically going to do over here at your location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| Make sure that you're enforcing the beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| That's an open parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| We will have bracelets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| We'll obviously have check IDs and we'll have bracelets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| And they're going to have security on the premises at Harley Davidson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| And, you know, I will be there personally, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| And I have an ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| And everybody that will be helping me out will have an ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Are you going to have people checking in, checking their IDs, getting a bracelet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Kind of like sundown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| I'm really not comfortable with your setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| I don't think that it's you're going to be selling out in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| or you're going to be selling inside the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| No, out of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Is that legal for her to sell in the parking lot on a temporary license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| I mean, it will be within the confines of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| And that's where you issue the temporary permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Do we limit the times that she can serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Say that she gives us the dates and the times and that's the only time the permit's eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Instead of all day on Saturday, like she says, four to nine or three to six or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| First of all, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Yes, sir, I believe you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| And I believe likewise the applicant would agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| So, yes, I think you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| That's probably me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Anyway, my question is the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| I understand that y'all are getting ready to celebrate Dial Brown's retirement for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| And my concern would be that people would come with a cooler in their trunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| How would you regulate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| I mean, they could go to Food City or Kroger and bring a case of alcohol or beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| Actually, I am only wanting to do draft beer and plastic cups because I think that the clear plastic cups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| and you can see I think it also cuts down on a lot of trash and that kind of stuff and the visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| I mean, it's hard to, like you said, you can duplicate a can or a bottle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| but you couldn't do that with a plastic cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| So if somebody had a can or a bottle, you would know that was obviously not sulfur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| So the security is going to outlaw any cases coming into the cooler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| My concern I'd have is people bringing extra in a cooler or something in the trunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| You always do the best you can to alleviate things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| But I know what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Yes, sort of the same lines as what Ivan was asking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Mr. Law Director, does she have to show proof of added liability for that one day that she's trying to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| or this weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| She assumes a liability and she's not really required to enforce anything beyond the scope of her permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| So if someone does show up with a case of beer, if it's not her premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| she really can't do a thing about it except notify the underlying lessee or the owner of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| She'll be responsible for the beer she dispenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| And that's where her liability begins and ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| You might want to check with your insurance agent to let them know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| I actually already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| And she's waiting for this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| She's already got the paperwork ready for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Have you checked on the catering license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I called the state and I spoke with Randy Poe and also Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| And they were confused and not really sure about the situation and suggested I go through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| They said they would try to issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| And then when I tried to fill out the paperwork, I went to get the paperwork actually from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| And they said, well, everything on there is conducive to liquor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| It doesn't have anything to do with beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Do we issue catering license in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| All that comes through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| Okay, what I was saying is my understanding of the law director, it may be cheaper for you to get a catering license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| and not go through this every time because I understood him to say if you had that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| you didn't have to have the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Am I correct on that, Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Well, the law reads that if you're a licensed restaurant or hotel and that you have a catering license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| the state would permit you to sell both wine and beer off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| But I can understand why it's confusing for her because these are rarely granted or rarely entertained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| And I don't think the local state entity has really had to deal with these in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Mr. Monick suggested I try to get the beer permit, you know, from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| This is a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| We've never done this before and they've never done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| So we were just kind of see how it goes this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1526)|
| 0:25:35| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Just so we're clear for the record, ma'am, you do have a current active Knox County beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| And you're even though you're spreading this over several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| you don't have more than 30 days of actual activities, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| It's 10, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| And who's going to be dispensing the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| It will be me and probably be an assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| And, again, they're all ABC trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| They're just some of my staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| And you understand regardless of the fact that this is off-premises, it is kind of a bootstrap off your current beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| which means heightened enforcement on the part of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| So, in other words, you're held to the same exact standard as if someone came into your premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| No problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| I totally understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I can question staff, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| but because this is an off-premise and actually off-site into someone else's entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| I don't know if any of the staffers have any input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| Yes, sir, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Wolfie, microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| I'd like the board to know that the applicant was cited on March 8, 2002 for sale to a miner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1604)|
| 0:26:55| 2002?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| I'll defer to the commission, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| I would move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| I move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Senator Luke, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| As part of your motion to limit the 12 dates that she's going to designate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| Yes, that's exactly as she outlined with the times and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| I just want to make sure that's part of the motion so that everybody understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| I can agree that the designated dates and times are part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Wolfie, do you care to keep an eye on that for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Discussion and possible action against beer permittees that are delinquent in paying their annual privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1674)|
| 0:28:05| I'm not sure who put this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| I don't know if anyone did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| There was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| If I remember right, Mr. Chairman, there was one particular license holder that had not paid their tax yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| And we were going to try to start the process of possibly taking their license for not paying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| If they're all paid, I don't know if they're paid now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| There's, I guess, nothing to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| Is that the facts that they have paid now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| According to the clerk, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| There's no one who is currently in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| It has to be official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| We need a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Any other things that need to come before the hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| We'll take a 30-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322beer?start=1754)|
