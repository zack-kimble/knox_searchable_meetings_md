| 0:03:47| Knoxville, Tennessee. Okay, tell us about your permit. On March 17th, you were aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=227)|
| 0:03:56| that you needed to go to TABC. Have you made application? Yes, I have and I have forwarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| that to one today. Okay, but you don't have, they've not heard it yet at TABC? No, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| have not. Okay, and I believe that, are they scheduled for May? May 19th. Okay, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| get on the agenda. Yes. Okay, Sgt. Hunter? No applicable record. Ms. Dyer? For the on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=252)|
| 0:04:22| and off the pub part. Okay, we need the building inspection approval, fire prevention approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| and health department approval. Okay, I'm going to suggest that we break this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| into two parts and I'm going to suggest that we defer the on and off premise application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| until the May 26th meeting. That's the serving, not the making of the permit? Correct, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Do I hear a motion? I'll move. All those in favor? Aye. Okay, so we will defer the pub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| part. Now, the second application is for the manufacturer and distribution and they, Sgt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| Hunter, we know that they're okay from your end, but what about the other parts? The same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| things, the building inspection, fire prevention and health department approvals. Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| we can again defer. How close are you to being ready to start brewing beer? Quite close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| The building is a little while away from being ready, but the actual brewing part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| brewery could be done fairly soon, before May 26th. Okay, all right. Is there any prohibition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| of approving this pending final documentation, this portion? No, this portion can be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| pending final documentation and then when he's ready and passes these inspections, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| can brew, but he can't sell anything until TABC okays it so that he meets the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| requirement. But he could be fermenting in a pot somewhere? He could be fermenting, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| if he, yes, when he meets some inspection issues. Counselman Greve? I move we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| and accept pending final documentation for him to be able to go ahead and brew because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| I had a conversation with a gentleman and he thinks that that may be a possibility before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| the May. Okay. So I make that motion. Okay, is there a second? Second. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Aye. Okay, so when these inspections are done on the brewery, you can come in and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| your permit for that and then when you hear back from TABC, if they bless you, then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| go ahead with the on and off. Okay, the TABC meeting is May 19th? Right. And so this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| is May 26th? Correct. So we couldn't do approved pending final for that? You would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| to just go ahead and move it to the May? If they approve you and you have a TABC permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| number, then at that point, we will very likely approve you. I can't say absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| but that would be the plan. Okay. All right? Okay, thank you. Madam Chair, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=400)|

| 0:10:47| have been on the beer board. Yeah, and I'm Robert Knight, 3425 Bellevue Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=647)|

| 0:11:47| because of documentation, so there's no one here besides me for the Market House Café.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| Sorry, Wanda. I bet you'd like us to... Just to defer it to May 26th, please. Okay. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=714)|

| 0:12:25| No applicable record. Ms. Dyer. The only thing we lack is the building inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| Okay. Ms. Palmer. Yes. I'm a little upset. The building inspector came April 6th, verbally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| approved it. I talked to Wanda today two days ago. I called the building inspector right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| after getting off the phone with Wanda, and she, again, Heather Dodge, says, yes, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| are approved, and here I am standing before you. I should have a complete packet tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| Okay. Ms. Day, Ms. Dyer, somebody? We haven't heard from her, and we'll certainly reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| out to her in the morning, but she didn't, she hasn't indicated to us that it's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| yet. And it's currently, well, other than until right now where the old beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| is turned in, it's an operating bar now, so I don't, I would like special circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| to be able to get my permit issued tonight because the beer trucks and my beer deliveries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=796)|
| 0:13:24| are waiting on my phone call tonight so I can make my deliveries this week. Well, until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| we have the actual approval in hand, and I believe you'll follow up with it tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| morning, what we can do is approve pending final documentation. As soon as they get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| word and the paper, then you can, they'll call you and you can get the permit. Will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| that work? Hopefully it will be tomorrow morning. That's the best we can do. It's tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| morning, but you understand that I have done everything upon my part, and I have verbally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| or physically, April 6th was my inspection. I was approved, and it's undue, I'm being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| I may be punished a week of beer delivery sales because I can't get, I can't, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| to have that number in to them by tomorrow. I understand that, and so in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| will you ladies check with building inspections and then contact him and tell him what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| issue is and then let me know where we are? Okay, so we have a motion pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| is there a second? Second. All those in favor? Aye. Okay, you will hear from us tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=865)|

| 0:15:43| Ms. Dyer. Building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| approval. Is there a distance issue? There is a distance issue. Okay, are you aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| the distance issue? I found out about it this morning. Okay, so you will be doing the TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| route. Yes, ma'am. We've already applied and paid for it. The only thing that's hinging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| on is the fire marshal inspection. We had an elevator issue. There was an operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| elevator permit for a handicap lift, but we did not know it needed a telephone. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| what we're waiting on for the fire department approval. Okay, all right. So I'll move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| approve pending final documentation, I guess. With the TABC, would that still apply? Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| to be consistent, we need to know that they've got the TABC number, and there won't be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| TABC meeting until May the 19th, and we'll meet on May the 26th. So we probably need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| to defer this to May the 26th. So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye. Okay, and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| by that time you will have your permit in hand, or at least the permit number. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| All right. Thank you. Wax and threads. Wax and threads. All right, this is the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1006)|
| 0:16:57| time that wax and threads has been a no-show, so I don't know if they are rethinking their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| position, they've lost interest, or what? Do you all want to move to defer to May the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| 26th? Do you want to let it die for lack of a motion? They also have not completed their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| task plan. Right. Let it die. Okay. Do I hear a motion? To do what? Let it die. How many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| times have we heard this? Twice. This is the second time. Then they didn't show up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| first time either. We've had no contact. All right. Do I hear a motion? To do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1047)|
| 0:17:36| To do nothing. Just don't say anything. Okay. One more time. Do I hear a motion? Okay, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| dies for lack of a motion. We're cooking. I saw that we're cooking is involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1064)|
| 0:17:54| this local baseball team. Andrea Rudd, the address is 1927 Cumberland Avenue. Okay, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| they have everything complete except they did not, they were too close to Children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| Hospital. You now have a TABC permit number. Yes, ma'am. So we actually know that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| been approved. So can we approve this pending final documentation because we have the TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| number? There is no final documentation. The file is complete. Oh, the file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| Okay. So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye. All right. Thank you. Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| All right, now we need to go back to those people who were not here before we go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| next part of the agenda. And I believe that we have the East Tennessee Equality Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| Anybody here from that group? Okay. Do I have a motion to defer this to May 22nd? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1120)|
| 0:18:51| All right. Second. All those in favor? Aye. Okay, so we'll do that on May 26th. The next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1131)|
| 0:19:00| one is Hannah's Cafe Volume Bar and Grill, and they've asked to be deferred. Los Mariachis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1140)|
| 0:19:11| Los Mariachis. Do I have a motion to? I move that we defer this until our May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1151)|
| 0:19:20| Okay. Is there a second? Have you had any contact with these folks? No, other than notifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| them that they should be here, but we haven't. Okay. All right. So we have a motion and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| second to move this to May 26th. All those in favor? Aye. All right. Thank you. Next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| on the agenda, we go to the addendum, and that involves two places. The first one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1178)|

| 0:19:58| And you have a problem with TDEC that you're working on. Is that correct? Yeah. It's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| a little longer process than we wanted it to be. We're just doing some extra redundant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| stuff just to make sure. So we should be done by the middle of next week, but we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| we'd request a 60-day extension just in case. Okay. So let's defer this to the May 26th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| and hope, extend to May 26th, and hope that you've got everything done by then, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| I know you're really ready to go. We are. But you better have clean soil around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| building. Exactly. That's it. But he has approval pending final documentation, so you just need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| to see Ms. Day or whatever. Right. So when you get that, you need to see Ms. Day. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you. Okay. We need a motion on that. So moved. Second? All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1240)|

| 0:21:03| Okay. The file needed the building inspection approval and fire inspection approval. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| you have those? We have not been notified yet of the building and fire, but it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| I did bring the green tag just in case that it's signed complete. When was that? This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| is dated the 10th of April. Wow. Whoa. Okay. Follow up in the morning on it, please. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| We're ready to brew. It's just the brewing part that we're... Do I need to contact them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| to have them contact you tomorrow? It wouldn't hurt. Wanda, you'll do it? Okay. Cookies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1295)|

| 0:21:47| to brew tomorrow, we need to extend this to May the 26th, but if this all gets worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| out before that time, then they can pick up their permit. Is that right? Pending final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| documentation. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. So moved. Second? Second. All those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1317)|

| 0:22:09| with the building. I know. I'll be talking to them tomorrow. Okay. That's what I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| going to ask. Something's not right if that was April 10th. Right. Well, and the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| one was in April also, so... April 6th or 7th. Right. So I'll be talking to Peter Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| tomorrow to find out what the issue is. All right. We now have two administrative hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Dock's All-American Grill will be first, and then the Melody Bar, and both of these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| coming to us with their second offense of selling to minors. And so let's hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| Dock's first. And they have submitted a remedial plan the second time. They've paid their $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1362)|
| 0:22:51| fine. Mr. Harris is here... Twice. Twice? I know. They paid it twice by mistake, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| Ms. Mitchell sent the second check back to us. Right. And we don't have an escrow account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| for your third offense, so you're okay. Go ahead. Before he says anything, tell us what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| our options are, just to review. Okay. Our options are to just accept the fine and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| remedial plan, and no further action is needed on our part. The second option is to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| them to the hearing officer. And I'm going to recommend, before he speaks, that we accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1400)|
| 0:23:29| these plans, and then have both attorneys, Mr. Bell and Mr. Harris, promise that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| will never be here again representing these people for a third offense, because if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| are, they will go to the hearing officer without passing go. All right. Would you tell us...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| Real quickly, my name is Greg Harrison, 800 South Gay Street, Suite 1650. I'm here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| behalf of Doc's All-American Grill, and I want to thank this board for taking me before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| my esteemed colleague, Mr. Bell. I'm a lot quicker than he is, but he talks a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| now. He knows a lot more than me, so he talks a lot more than me. We submitted the remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| plan. We'd ask for you to review that and accept that as the chairperson has just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| and we have paid the $500 fine. And I would submit very quickly that this may be one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| the most comprehensive remedial plans that I've ever submitted on behalf of a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| establishment. So, thank you. All right. Well, we will expect, after we have a bit of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| we will expect that this plan will work and have no holes, loopholes, leaks, gaps, or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| So, anybody on the beer board have anything that you want to say? Councilman De La Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| I wonder if he would just tell us briefly the kind of training he expects to have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| a sort of continuing basis. I would say this about the incident in October. The employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| did check the identification. She read the birth date and called out the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| She just miscalculated the birth date as being a date in which the person was eligible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| consume alcoholic beverages. And what he has done, or what the establishment has done now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| is to emphasize each day before... Magic date? I'm sorry? Magic date they must be aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Yes. And she made a mistake, but it's not as if she... It's the same ending, but she was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1531)|
| 0:25:40| really trying... It wasn't like she didn't check. Yes, she checked. She called the date out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| She just miscalculated the date. So, we're emphasizing the magical date, as you would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| each day before business opens to all the employees. Okay. Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| Okay. We will take no further action on this except there are plans and not see you again on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| Yes. All right. The next one is... Thank you. You're welcome. The next one is Melody Barr,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| and they submitted a plan and paid the fine. Mr. Bell, welcome. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| Stephan, come around here, please. I'd like to present to you Stephan Bunch, who is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| owner of the Melody Barr. Okay. We need to have your name and address, though, first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Okay. My name is James Bell. I'm an attorney here at Knoxville, and my office business address is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| number 10 Emory Place, next door to Mr. Greaves' office. We've not discussed anything about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1597)|
| 0:26:46| matter intentionally at all. The Melody Barr has been a member of the Melody Barr Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| since the early 70s. It's been a fixture on North Central since at least the 60s, because I went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| Fulton High School, and I remember driving by there. It was owned by a lady by the name of Mildred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| After that, she sold it to Mr. Bunch's grandfather, Ralph Bunch, sometime in the early 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| This is the second time Stephan Bunch, the current owner, has been involved with this bar for approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1633)|
| 0:27:27| five years. The Melody Barr is situated right near the cross street past the underpass on North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| I guess the cross road, I wrote it down here, is Atlantic Avenue, is the best I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1652)|
| 0:27:46| The clientele is working class individuals. There was an incident which the state cited, or which the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| law enforcement officers cited Mr. Bunch for earlier. The criminal charges were dismissed. Basically, the testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1672)|
| 0:28:10| was an older gentleman came up, ordered a beer, a younger cadet came by and grabbed the beer off the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| In this instance, what had happened, the lady did indeed check, we interviewed her, check the license, misread it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1696)|
| 0:28:30| misunderstood it, the date. It was just one of the frailties of being human. She didn't calculate it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| We have paid the $500. We have submitted a very engaging remedial plan, and it's outlined there in six or seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1715)|
| 0:28:52| bullet points. I would submit it for your consideration. You can see the pictures that we've submitted. No one's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| I've recommended to Mr. Bunch that if anybody under 18 enters, call me. I will personally prosecute them in criminal court for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1738)|
| 0:29:12| trespass. That means cadets too. I'm not above doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| We believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| If I don't think Mr. Bunch should be back down here, he better not. He's going to run out of money paying me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Okay, and at least double your fees if he comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| Gentlemen of the beer board, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| Okay, and you're all in agreement then that we accept this, send them on their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| Mr. Bell, it's nice to see you. Mr. Bunch, it's nice to see you, but we don't want to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| I don't come down here much or often, but I do enjoy the few times I do come here. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| All right, you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| East Tennessee Equality Council has arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| That's okay. Mark, if you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| Don't we have to change? We voted to move it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| We need to reconsider. We had postponed you. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Now, Mark James, will you tell us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Mark James, 9800 Christy Ridge Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| We need to vote on the reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| All right, now, all those in favor of approving the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| Okay, got it. Congratulations. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| Any other business before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150428?start=1848)|
