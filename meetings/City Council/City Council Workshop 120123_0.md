| 0:00:00| In 8 years of serving on city council, fortunate enough, my health was fine, everything was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=8)|
| 0:00:09| I made every single regularly scheduled meeting, that's over 200 meetings in an 8 year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=9)|
| 0:00:16| I would likewise endeavor to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=16)|
| 0:00:22| Like I said in the initial interview process, I practice with a number of people, I always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=22)|
| 0:00:26| make sure my clients are taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| If for some unavoidable reason I couldn't be here, I would sit down with who would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| my substitute and go over item by item the agenda that was coming up so they wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=35)|
| 0:00:43| be walking in cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| I would also let each and every one of you all know where I was, why I couldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=44)|
| 0:00:53| Number 5, a city council member requests that you draft an ordinance or resolution on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| issue about which you feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| The requested ordinance or resolution by the council member is the opposite of what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| philosophically believe to be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| How would you handle this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| I would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| I mean, you know, an attorney's not there to try to persuade you, say you're wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=69)|
| 0:01:16| you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| I mean, they're within certain bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| If you're going to do something, propose something that's illegal, I would probably tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| you might not want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| There are certain, you know, ramifications, whether it's raising constitutional issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| for example, but I would do it and I would do it just as if I was in full agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| It's, you know, an attorney has to take direction from his or her client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| Number 6, a zoning appeal comes to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| You know that if council upholds the appeal, there will be litigation costing the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that the appeal to the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| will most likely prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| How would you advise council on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| Well, there are certain circumstances, as the people who have been serving for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| probably know and those who are new will probably learn, that you're going to get sued no matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| You have to be able to create a record that makes it as good as possible for you to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| your council help defend you in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| You can always counsel the members of city council one-on-one beforehand to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| well, if you do this, here's one potential outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| If you do that, here's another potential outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Sometimes when I served, some, one of my colleagues would say something that would give an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=162)|
| 0:02:50| an opening to file an appeal with court, and I would come back and help turn the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=170)|
| 0:02:59| turn the topic to one of the relevant and valid criteria why council could or could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| not make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| It's important that, you know, what a court looks at is the record that is created by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| So, it's important you have a good record when you're going up to court if it's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Seven and eight, they're fairly lengthy questions, there's parts of it, so if you could be, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| know, fairly succinct with, and why I ask them one at a time, but if you could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| get through those as quickly as you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| City council's legal needs often arise on the spot while we debate matters at the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Are you comfortable with giving us legal advice on questions asked at a public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| What legal preparation would you do to prepare for agenda issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Well, you know, I've reviewed, obviously, the agendas for over 200 meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| I reviewed agendas before I was on council, and I've reviewed agendas even after I left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| That's the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| I mean, you don't ever walk into a meeting cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| You've got to see what's coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| As folks probably know by this point, you know the controversial zonings that are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| up, because you've been getting called by constituents, citizens, attorneys on either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| side of the situation, so you know what's coming up in many regards, and you know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| to prepare for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Describe your experience handling zoning matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Well, this is my 16th year of practicing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| Obviously, in my first or second year, in 1996, my wife and I bought our first home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| in the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| I volunteered my time and services as council to my neighborhood on a pro bono basis, representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| them in front of Metropolitan Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, and City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| So I've been, well before I was fortunate enough to serve the 4th District, I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| going through zoning matters, and it was actually because of my involvement in going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| zoning matters for my neighborhood that people asked me to run for City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| I think, you know, if you ever wanted to look back at the records when I served folks on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| council, I mean Mark Brown, for example, called me council zoning expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| You know, since that time, you know, zoning is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| I mean, zoning is part of the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| You can't make a zoning decision that's not based on what is allowed in the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| So I'm familiar with land use issues, I do real estate development, so I feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| with zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| And I also served on the Historic Zoning Commission, I just, you know, thought about that, served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| with Councilman Grieve and Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| Number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| We are willing to pay you a monthly retainer fee to handle all our basic legal work, plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| true out-of-pocket expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| There will be times when the workload is greater in some months than others, but the fee stays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| The last council averaged roughly 66 hours per month and did not bill us extra when he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| went over, even though technically he could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Are you willing to represent us on such a retainer basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| I am well aware that public service is a sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| It takes time and away from other things that you would like to do, your normal job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| your normal activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| I think it would be a privilege to serve this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| You all aren't in it for the salary, it's because it's just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| In many regards, it might cost you all more from being away from your respective businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| but it's because you have a duty of good public service that you all are here, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| what I would be as your Alls Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Would you be willing to give us advance notice when you foresee extraordinary expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Number 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| The legislative body touches many lives and businesses, and if you sit in this, why are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| you the right choice to be City Council's attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| Well, I guess a short summary, I understand public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| I've been through the pressure and the hard votes in the past that each of you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| been through and that you will be going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| I've worked with the Open Meetings Act, I've worked with zoning, I've been to beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| meetings, MPC meetings, the alphabet soup of different regulatory bodies that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| I know what it's like to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I'll serve you all individually, and I'll serve you all as a collective group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| Council's attorney gets a call on Wednesday morning following a Tuesday meeting, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| say to you, you know that ordinance where I cast the deciding ballot on the 5-4 vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| I decided I was wrong and I want to go back and change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| Can you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| What's the response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| What's your advice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| That's a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Somebody on the prevailing side has to be the one putting that forward, and if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| a motion to reconsider on that same meeting only takes a majority of five votes to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=524)|
| 0:08:53| on that same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| In your scenario, if you want to have it considered at a subsequent meeting it will take six votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| and that's only to reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| The vote could still turn out the same, but it puts it back on the agenda for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| I've had the same questions since I asked Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Your knowledge on parliamentary procedure, as you know, we get in a little deep water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Just your knowledge on parliamentary procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| Well, you know, a lot of parliamentary procedure for you all is on-the-job training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| It was for me, but I've also, you know, gone through Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| When, you know, because they're constant, you know, you have motions to table like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| all had in your last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| A motion to table, in my experience, is atypical, but it's certainly allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| You have motions to postpone or, you know, you want to put things off until you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I think, you know, my on-the-job training and my review of Robert's Rules of Order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| in the past will help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| I don't remember, you know, the different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Mr. Swanson was great for this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| I greatly appreciated the ability to sit next to Charles for all eight years of my service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| That's literally a great place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| But I also served with Bill Haslam for six years, and when Charles wasn't there and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| had different people, a substitute if parliamentary questions came up, Bill looked to me to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| out with that because Charles had great knowledge of Robert's Rules of Order, but when Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| wasn't there, Bill would look over to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Rob, as you said, you've served eight years on city council, and during those eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| you served with Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| And earlier we've decided that Charles, we called him the alpha dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| And so now he's going to be on the other side sitting over there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| And what do you see as your relationship with him, I mean, in terms of any kind of conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| and this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Well, no, I don't think Charles really hadn't left in more ways than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| I got along with Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| I also disagreed with Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| We had, like each of you, I mean, this body is one body, but it's nine different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| that have nine different views on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| You know, for some people, traffic calming in their district is getting the drugs off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| the street, and other people, traffic calming in their district is slowing down cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| You have different views on issues, but, you know, you have to politely and make an informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| representation on why you disagree with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| I mean, when I was on council, I would never walk in not prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| And you can have two informed people that have different opinions of similar situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| because of different life experiences, how they've, you know, done things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| Thankfully, there aren't many times that council disagrees with the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| But when you do, you have to have a good working relationship, which I think I have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| with Charles or the, you know, most of the people in the city law department, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| all the people in the city law department, that, you know, you've got to advocate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| position and see what you can work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| Councilman Camp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=770)|
| 0:13:01| Well, a lot of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| Charles didn't agree to sit back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| Let's hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| I can assure you it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| Yeehaw!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| At this point, should I, hey Nick, should I tell them the quacky story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=807)|
| 0:13:36| Afternoon, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| I'm well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| Fire away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Tell us your understanding of what the lawyer council for city council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| My understanding is that the lawyer is to advise council on its legal obligations and rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| primarily looking to the city charter and the code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| Beyond that, I don't believe council to council has much in the way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| responsibility to give their personal opinions on matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| Number two, you have a client who has a court date this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| A member of council calls with a question about an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| How would you manage to meet both clients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Well, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Typically, I would ask if it was possible for one or the other to delay their questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=877)|
| 0:14:45| until I'm able to deal with the question from the council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| I know that most of the courts are understanding of other obligations and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=892)|
| 0:15:00| that council has in front of those courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Number three, how many hours per month do you expect the city council lawyer to require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| I know that the council meets every other week and that there are also various boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| that are made up of representatives of council that would require legal representation at some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| if not all, of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| I'm assuming 30 to 40 hours a month, but that's maybe on the high or low side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| There will be times when a city council meeting or workshop is scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| but you need to be out of town or another client needs your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| Yet, city council requires the presence of an attorney for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| In very specific terms, describe how you will meet the requirement that either you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| or another attorney be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Well, as I mentioned last week when we had the interview process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| I am a sole practitioner, so I would not be able to turn to another lawyer in my firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| to represent me at a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| However, I have had conversations with more than one attorney who is a resident of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| that are more than willing to act as a second in the unlikely event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| that I was not able to attend a city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| A city council member requests that you draft an ordinance or resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| on an issue about which you feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| The requested ordinance or resolution by the council member is the opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| of what you philosophically believe to be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| How would you handle this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| I would do the bidding of what the city council member has asked me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| I think in our role as attorneys, we don't always agree with the position of our client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| but that doesn't relieve us from our obligation to put our best foot forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| in representing whatever our client's wishes may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| A zoning appeal comes to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| You know that if council upholds the appeal, there will be litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| costing the city thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| and that the appeal to the courts will most likely prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| How would you advise council on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Well, in my practice of 20-plus years here in Knoxville, I'm not a litigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| I'm primarily a transactional attorney working on mergers and acquisitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| and board governance and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| And I have spent the better part of those 20-plus years advising clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| on how to avoid litigation at all costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| I frankly feel that litigation can not only drain time and money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| but it really takes away from the productive work of an individual or party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| that may be tied up in that litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| So I would work however possible to avoid the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| These next two questions are kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| There's quite a bit to it, and we'll ask them one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| so if you could just answer them as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| City council's legal needs often arise on the spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| while we debate matters at the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Are you comfortable with giving us legal advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| on questions asked at a public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| I am, and if I'm not, I will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| What legal preparation would you do to prepare for agenda items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| I would review the agenda items, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| and check with both the charter and ordinances of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| to see how they may affect the agenda item that's coming before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| And to the extent there were council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| that wished to discuss it with their legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| I would make myself available to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Describe your experience handling zoning matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| I can't say that I have any experience handling zoning matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| We are willing to pay you a monthly retainer fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| to handle all our basic legal work, plus true out-of-pocket expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| There will be times when the workload is greater in some months than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| but the fee stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| The last council averaged roughly 66 hours per month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| and did not bill us extra when he went over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| even though technically he could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Are you willing to represent us on such a retainer basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| I am, and as a matter of fact, my two largest clients right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| I represent on a retainer basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| and they pay me a monthly stipend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| and we review it every six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| and if I'm spending considerably more hours than we had originally negotiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| then we'll look at it and see if it needs to be adjusted one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| If I'm not spending as many hours as I've been asked to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| then I've reduced the retainer amount in that direction as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| Would you be willing to give advance notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| when you foresee extraordinary expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| A legislative body touches many lives and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| In a few sentences, why are you the right choice to be city council's attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Well, as I mentioned when we were gathered on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| I'm born and raised in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| My family goes back several generations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| and I really deeply care about the city and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| I have four young children who were growing up in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| and when I graduated from high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| I had 99 people in my graduating class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| most of whom went away to college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| and a lot of them didn't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| So I want to give my children every reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| to spend the rest of their lives here in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| and I think that I could help in that regard by working with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1252)|
| 0:21:01| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Put you on the spot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| As council's attorney, you get a call on Wednesday morning following Tuesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| and I say to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| you know that ordinance where I cast a deciding ballot in the 5-4 vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| I've decided I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| That's even harder for me to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| I've decided I was wrong, and I want to go back and change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Can you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| What would be your advice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| What do you do in that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Well, again, I'd have to look at the charter and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| as to how that is dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| but it's my understanding that anything that is voted upon by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| has to have two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| and it may be that there would be an opportunity at the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| to change one's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| But I would look to the charter and the ordinances to advise you in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| I want to ask you your knowledge of parliamentary procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| and Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| I know Robert's Rules of Order well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| As I mentioned, I've been a corporate lawyer for 20-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| so I spend a lot of time in boardrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| In addition, I have chaired three boards, I believe it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| the most recent of which was the Knoxville Museum of Art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| and if you think having nine members is difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| we had 47 board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| So I've learned quite a bit about Robert's Rules of Order in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| Further questions of this applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1359)|
| 0:22:52| About nine minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| The second one was about 16 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1379)|
| 0:23:11| Hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I would have never had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| And I wouldn't stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| I hope that they don't leave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Oh, it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| I don't know if it's live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I don't think it's live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| And how can I help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Well, like me, I see you got your voice back, so congratulations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| I just barely got it back, but I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| My wife wasn't all that happy about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| but we've got nine or so questions to run by you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| and so we'll let Ms. Mitchell have at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Number one, tell us your understanding of what the Lawyer Council for City Council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| Well, Lawyer Council will give you advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| but more importantly than that, the council as a whole is my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| And as my client, that's who I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| As a client, that doesn't mean that I don't serve you individually, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| but I must serve a client, and that's who I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| You have a client who has a court date this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| A member of council calls with a question about an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| How would you manage to meet both clients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Well, that's a depends question, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| There are some things that I can handle with my client, with whoever I have on staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| with my partners, they can handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| Or, it depends upon what your question is, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| Number three, how many hours per month do you expect the City Council Lawyer to require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| As much as you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| But I've talked to Charles, frankly, and I understand that he puts in about 60 hours a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| There will be times when a City Council meeting or workshop is scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| but you need to be out of town or another client needs your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Yet, City Council requires the presence of an attorney for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| In very specific terms, describe how you will meet the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| that either you or another attorney be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| Well, if I know what my schedule is, I should be available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| If I'm not available to you, say, for example, I have to fly out of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| or go someplace else or go to another state and defend one of my clients out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| I will have available at least three competent attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| that I will fill in and be available to you on the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| A City Council member requests that you draft an ordinance or resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| on an issue about which you feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| The requested ordinance or resolution by the Council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| is the opposite of what you philosophically believe to be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| How would you handle this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Let's go. Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| A zoning appeal comes to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| You know that if Council upholds the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| there will be litigation costing the City thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| and that the appeal to the courts will most likely prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| How would you advise Council on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| I apologize. There was litigation of which we won or lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| Mr. Palmer, do you want to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| A zoning matter, for example, comes to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| and because of the vote of Council or where it's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| you know that one party or the other will appeal the Council vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| Oh, appeal the Council vote. I didn't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| So the question is, you'll also know this will cost a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| so how would you advise Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Well, I'd tell Council how much it was going to cost to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| and let them make that decision in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| But I'd give them advice whether you had a likelihood of winning on appeal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1628)|
| 0:27:18| Oh, yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| These next two questions are segments to each of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| so we'll read them to you one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| So if you could just be as succinct as you can with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| City Council's legal needs often arise on the spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| while we debate matters at the Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Are you comfortable with giving us legal advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| on questions asked at a public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| What legal preparation would you do to prepare for agenda issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Well, like I've done for tonight, I've read your agenda for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| I've also taken a look at the city charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| and what I thought might be some questions as far as the ordinance is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| Describe your experience handling zoning matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| It's been a while since I've done anything as far as zoning is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| My most recent experience has been opposing zoning for my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| appearing before a county commission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| We are willing to pay you a monthly retainer fee to handle all our basic legal work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| plus true out-of-pocket expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| There will be times when the workload is greater in some months than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| but the fee stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| The last Council averaged roughly 66 hours per month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| and did not bill us extra when he went over, even though technically he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Are you willing to represent us on such a retainer basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| I've done that with my clients before, and I'll do it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Would you be willing to give advance notice when you foresee extraordinary expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| I would keep you informed of all my expenses and all my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| A legislative body touches many lives and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| In a few sentences, why are you the right choice to be City Council's attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| Because I enjoy the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| As Council's attorney, you get a call on Wednesday morning following Tuesday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| And I ask you, I tell you, I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| you know that ordinance where I cast a deciding ballot five to four vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| I've decided I was wrong and I want to go back and change my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| Can you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| And what would be the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Well, let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| And the answer to your question is we need to go back to Council if you need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| Yes, that would be my advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| How do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Well, you'd, and I apologize, I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| I'm not real certain, but I would guess, if you want me to guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| which you really probably don't want me to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| that you would report back next Council that you had rescinded your vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| and have it go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Probably the best thing to do would be to have the ordinance rebrought before Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| I'd like to ask you about your knowledge of parliamentary procedure, Robert's Rules of Orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120123?start=1821)|
