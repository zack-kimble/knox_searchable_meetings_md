| 0:14:08| For four weeks, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Perhaps it came from the law department, but at any rate, this item needs a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=856)|

| 0:14:40| Under the mayor's report, this afternoon we announced that Holston Gases is expanding its Knoxville presence into the I-275 corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=880)|
| 0:14:53| where it will build a state-of-the-art plant on Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| Bill Baxter, Holston CEO, announced that in the first phase the company will invest up to $10 million and add 20 to 30 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=898)|
| 0:15:09| They will maintain the existing facility across the river from downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| This is an important retention of a great local business and continues the momentum in the downtown north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=916)|
| 0:15:25| Curbside recycling has begun and is off to a good start, and we appreciate everybody's patience as we roll out this new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=925)|
| 0:15:35| Also, the city of Knoxville will host an open house and hold a city council workshop focusing on the proposed pedestrian bicycle bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=935)|
| 0:15:46| that would cross the Tennessee River to connect the south waterfront with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| Both public meetings will include drawings and information about the conceptual design of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| as well as a look at the alternatives considered during the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| The open house, which is also aimed at gathering public comment on the conceptual design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| is set for 6 p.m. until 8 Monday, October the 10th, in the City View Condominiums Clubroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=972)|
| 0:16:22| Also on yesterday, the city of Knoxville celebrated its birthday, 1791 until 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=982)|
| 0:16:34| So we want to remember the birthday of our great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| Are there any council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| I have a couple of items I'd just like to bring up and have part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| The first thing is that I'm sure that a number of you were aware of the accident that occurred on Kingston Pike with the individual in the wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1012)|
| 0:17:02| And one of the things that I'd like for us to look into is what kind of possibilities there might be to enhance the safety of these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1022)|
| 0:17:10| such as, I don't know, Chief, if there's a requirement that they have a red flag or something on their chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| But I would hope that there would be some way that we could look into this to see that we have that taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| I know in the Bearden area we have an awful lot of people in the mobilized wheelchairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| And, unfortunately, we had that tragic event occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| And I'd like to see that there might be some way in which we can avoid any of those further kinds of accidents on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| Also, I just want to mention that we did open the Paper Mill Bluff Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| Donna Young was there, and she was honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| As you all know, she's retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| And we have a bench in her name on that part of the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| And if any of you get a chance, be sure to come over and take a walk on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| A little bit different environment than the ones we have in the rest of the city since it goes right along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| But it was a great cooperation between the state, the city, the church that's there, and a couple of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1084)|
| 0:18:12| And so that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| The other thing that I've asked that the law department take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| and that has to do with the definition of family and our residential requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| We're having a number of questions have been asked of me by people not only in my district but across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| about where we stand with the definition of family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| And I've asked Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| They're looking into seeing about how that can be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| So that's one thing that's being looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| The other thing is we've had a couple of situations where we have some problem with noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| We have a couple of establishments that are close to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| And we've had noise problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| And the police have been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| And I talked to the police chief about this a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| And he recommended that one of the things that we ought to look into is our noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| He has checked with a number of other cities and places that have certain kinds of ordinances that are more than just what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1142)|
| 0:19:10| And so, again, we've asked the law department and the police to look into this to see if there might be a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| that we can modify our ordinance in such a way to take care of problems with residential areas right next to the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| So those are a couple of items that I just wanted to be sure to get on the record, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1166)|

| 0:20:38| If I might, I was going to ask Mr. King a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| I noticed that this contract is for $263,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| What else is in the overall funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1245)|

| 0:20:49| You've got some design work you've already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| What else is covered in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1251)|

| 0:21:04| So those three make up the basic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1264)|

| 0:22:19| Councilman Del Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Yes, I wonder if we have someone from KUB here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| This is one of a series of, I guess, water bonds that you've had issued since 2004, and as I look at those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| there's about $83 million outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| You had originally borrowed about $86 million, and this will put us at about $108 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| I've read stuff that you've sent out that we're in our second century, so to speak, of a system that's old and you're replacing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| Would you just give us a short narrative of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Because I think citizens might want to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Now, before you begin, could you give your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| My name is Mark Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| I live at 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| I'll go back in time, maybe to around 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| That was actually when KUB had begun to implement what we call our Century 2 infrastructure program for the water distribution system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| We realized that it was an aging system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| We needed to increase our rate of water main replacement, and so we began that program then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| We were actually going from replacing about five miles of water main per year to 14 miles per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| and we had a significant funding plan put in place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Well, in late 2008, the economic recession was in, I guess, full swing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| and we decided to temporarily defer the rate of increase in our investment spending on the water system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| because we had a large rate increase that had been planned for 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| It was not the time to be doing that to our water system customers, so we temporarily deferred that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| This past spring, in April 2011, our board decided it was basically time to resume the Century 2 water program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| and with that, they have endorsed a ten-year funding plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| So this is actually the first of several bond issues that will occur over the next ten years for the water distribution system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| this $25 million issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| What's the total cost that you're expecting to spend over the next ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| With respect to improving the infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Yeah, the water system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| This is for the water system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| It's about $210 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| So you're going to have a series of bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| And to the right of this, there's probably going to be a series of rate increases that have to cover some of these costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| The board, at their September meeting, actually adopted three 5% water rate increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| They'll be effective, first one beginning this January and then the following January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| and the following January to help fund that program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Well, thank you much for that information, but I thought people might want to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil111004?start=1494)|
