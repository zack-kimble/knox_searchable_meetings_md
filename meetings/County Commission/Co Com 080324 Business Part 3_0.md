| 0:00:00| Again, it's my district and I've had the problems with the smell to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| And I understand we've got that under control by removing biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4)|
| 0:00:08| But, I mean, we're debating for an awfully long time on something that essentially Mr. Moore put this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8)|
| 0:00:16| I want to ask him, is this asking them to pay us the back pay amount that will ultimately be decided through the lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=16)|
| 0:00:25| Or is this just asking them to start paying us what they would pay us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=25)|
| 0:00:31| Mr. Lambert, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| What I'm asking for is, starting tomorrow, that they file in compliance and start making the payments as they sign in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=33)|
| 0:00:40| And what this commission needs to do is to think back and see if you believe that something was going on somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=40)|
| 0:00:48| Because from day one, from day one, from the day they signed this contract, they've never paid us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| So from day one, they've been out of compliance, I guess, or they thought that Knox County hadn't come into compliance with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=56)|
| 0:01:03| From day one, if you go back and look at the budget years, the solid waste directors, the solid waste budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| never budgeted any income coming in from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| And this is the biggest deal that the solid waste department in this county has ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| And, Bruce, Lumpy, if you'll excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| I've still got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| If I can ask Bruce one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Bruce, how much have we spent, the taxpayers, on this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| And I'm not advocating anything bad about the facility because we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| But how much have we spent to build this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Well, who would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Is Tom Salter here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| I mean, I can get the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| I just don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| It's millions, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| I really would need to sit back and see because it's been a progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| We bought the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| I don't know how much we paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| Put down a roll of compacted concrete up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| We put a building up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| There's a number of components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| I just, the numbers out there, I just need to add it all up so I'd have a total for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Do you have an answer to this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Is how come from day one, the first week of their operation, that they never paid us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=123)|
| 0:02:11| I guess we're out of compliance since 2003 in their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| Day one, we were out of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Didn't do what we said we were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| I really can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| I mean, that was a decision John Evan made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| I can only relate to you what he told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| I want to try something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| Bruce, under the new RFP, what amount of rent are we going to charge per month for this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| That will be up to the responding bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| Essentially, it's almost like a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| It's exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Can you make a rough estimate of what that will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| I would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| It's an open bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| David, come up to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| Here's where I'm struggling is that, and I understand there's some dispute about how much is owed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| and what should be paid and what shouldn't be paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| but here's where I'm struggling is that I know that your client is bringing in some money at this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=192)|
| 0:03:20| and they're actually going to be rebidding to run this facility on the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| We've got roughly three months left of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| and I would feel an awful lot better if they would pay Knox County something for the use of this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| especially considering they're about to place a bid to basically rent this facility from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| It has got to be worth some amount of money to be using this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| And I'm not sure if Mr. Moore's proposal to just start paying the contract where you dispute whether the contract is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=232)|
| 0:04:02| or not, but can you talk with your clients and see what they would be willing to pay us in rent for the next three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| Because I'm really struggling because I've been down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| I've seen the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| I see folks coming in, paying the dump stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| I've seen folks coming in, buying the finished product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| and I'm really struggling with the fact that they've been there that whole time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| and apparently haven't paid anything, and I would feel a lot better about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| if they were willing to pay some sort of rent moving forward for the next three months until this contract is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| Would your clients be willing to offer some form of payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| perhaps something similar to what you plan on proposing in your proposal as replying to the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=283)|
| 0:04:55| Commissioner, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| I simply, my hands are tied on the issue of what I can tell you with regard to the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| I'm not permitted to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| There is a stricture on us under the purchasing code about making statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| and commitments relative to a pending RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Now, the issue of not having paid anything for all these many years, you know, some may express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=313)|
| 0:05:23| I mean, David, that's going to be decided in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| I mean, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| I think everybody here knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| There's a lawsuit and a court is going to decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| What I'm thinking about is for the next three months that, as a show of good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| that your client pays something for the use of this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| Well, I think Commissioner Leuthold, you know, made the point that it needs to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| I expressed this earlier to Commissioner Moore that, and we've talked with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| about potentially mediating our differences and resolving all of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| our issues and the county's issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| I think that's what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Rather than debating pieces of the puzzle, we need to get all of the issues on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=364)|
| 0:06:12| and through the attorneys and the client representatives, we need to resolve all the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| I mean, I'll just tell you, if you don't make, if your client doesn't make a counteroffer for what they're willing to pay us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| for the next three months to use that facility, I'll have no choice but to go along with Mr. Moore's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| And I know this is going to be worked out in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| I'm just, and I know that the past is the past, and that will ultimately be decided by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| But I'm just looking at what do we do for the next three months, and I know it's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| I know that the facility is worth something to your client, and I feel like Knox County should be getting something for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=405)|
| 0:06:54| And I'm asking you if you can talk to Sid and come up with an alternative proposal to what Mr. Moore has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=414)|
| 0:07:04| I don't think my client would be disagreeable with the concept of doing whatever needs to be done to satisfy this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=424)|
| 0:07:18| revenue share situation as of this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| But what I keep expressing, and I guess I kind of feel like I'm not being very effective, is that you're asking me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| and my client to make a commitment from this day or starting tomorrow forward through the balance of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| And I've stated, and I'll state again, that I think my client has a reasonable expectation that the county will make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| same commitment back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| And that's what needs to be negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| And then that's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Well, I mean, you've been there for I don't know how many years and apparently haven't paid anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| And I know it's been, and I know the court will decide what number, who owes who what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| but I just think it's worth something to use the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I think it's worth something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| And looking out for the taxpayers, I think that, I know that we're doing a new RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=485)|
| 0:08:13| and I think that if you offered something, if you said, you know, whatever, I'll pay this much a month for the next three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| months, I would feel a whole lot better about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| I just, you could talk, but I just want to state this is an unusual scenario where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=505)|
| 0:08:35| I'm just trying to do something to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| We have pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| And you're wanting to extract commitments that, in my opinion, bear directly on the pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=520)|
| 0:08:49| And so it's with some hesitance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| My client wants to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| And he can say whatever he wants with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| But this is a two-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| I'm Sid Bryan, 6271 Boone Drive, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the president and owner of Natural Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| And I may not get legal counsel for this, but to address your point, Commissioner, two or three things now that seem to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| numerous things that seem to never come up, but specifically as it may relate to what you're addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| Well, I'm not, honestly, I'm not worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Let him talk, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| I'm just saying I'm not asking about the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| I'm asking about the next three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Yeah, but relative to the past, one thing we have not done is we have not implemented a CPI increase, which is in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| Over the course of the whole five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| So, to your point, the county has tipped at $23 a ton, which is a very reasonable rate, and it hadn't moved for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=581)|
| 0:09:50| We've also given away, I think, to the tune of $15,000 worth of in-kind materials over the course of the five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=590)|
| 0:09:59| And to go one point further, just to address your point right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| I'm willing to stand here now and commit that we won't charge the county tipping at all for the rest of the time of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| It's got to make you feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| For the next three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| That's, I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Yes, we've had a workshop on this where we talked about it for several hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| This is the third time I've heard all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Some of these things really need to be settled in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Some of the evidence that's been presented may or may not be admissible in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| Some of it may or may not be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| It seems to me that needs to be determined in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| and we probably don't have the legal expertise as individuals or maybe even as scientists to say what's what with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=639)|
| 0:10:47| I can't remember if there's a motion on the floor or not, but I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| We have five people after these five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| We've got a motion and a second to call for the question after the five lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| Mr. Chairman, do we have a motion on the floor yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| You made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| No, you've got a motion to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| That's what the motion is, to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| But we don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| We don't have a question to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| We don't have nothing to vote on yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Do it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| So my motion, Mr. Chairman, is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| It's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| That's what happens when the discussion goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| I couldn't remember if there was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Well, I was remembering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I want to make a motion that we direct the law director to send in written notice our intent to cancel the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=693)|
| 0:11:44| within 15 days if they do not come into compliance with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=704)|
| 0:11:52| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Your motion says terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| The resolution says terminate the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Terminate the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| And within the thing it says if the contractor does not cure the default within 15 calendar days of such date notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=721)|
| 0:12:10| the Knox County Law Director is authorized to direct any and all necessary actions to terminate the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| And that is if they do not cure it within 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| Yeah, I was going to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| What the contract provides is that the county would give the contractor 15 days notice to rectify the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=744)|
| 0:12:33| Now, keep in mind, they're going to give us a 15 day notice as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| And then if the contractor does not rectify the problem and it continues to persist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| then the county may give a 30 day written notice of termination to cancel the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| By that point, we're halfway to the end of the contract anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Keep in mind that in a contractual situation, we have a six-year statute of limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=775)|
| 0:13:05| We are not under the gun, so to speak, to enter into this type of litigation at this moment in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=785)|
| 0:13:16| There are a number of issues that may be able to be addressed through mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| which we would bring the results of that mediation back to this body for ultimate approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| We might want a member of this body to sit with us through the mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| Commissioner Moore, you might be just the person to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| This body may wish to appoint one of its members to sit with us through the mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| We've done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| Fifteen days and then a 30 day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| And keep in mind, they're going to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| There are deficiencies on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Commissioner Moore, would remedy be them removing the tipping fee of $23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| Well, let's ask Mr. Weitrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Now, let's keep in mind that they've never honored a contract from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| that we asked the administration, Commissioner Cawood and Commissioner Lambert did, back in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| Two months later or three months later, they came forward and told us that the contract is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| They looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Nothing's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| And then we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Mr. Weitrich, how much do we pay them a year for our tipping fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| Actually, I provided you with a spreadsheet with all those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| I think it was like $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Whatever that spreadsheet is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| I don't have it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| And believe me, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| I'm not trying to be evasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| I just don't want to give you a number and then find out I'm way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| How much do we do a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Here again, I had that spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| I don't have it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| There was a spreadsheet that showed essentially all departments within Knox County and other agencies that utilize the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| I just don't have that spreadsheet with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| But I was told they gave me that they estimated we do about 100 tons a month on an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| That's what my department ends up using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| But I don't know that to be fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| A hundred tons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| A hundred tons, which we work out to about $2,300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| That may not be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| But I did provide you with a spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| We went back and got the numbers for the past several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| Does anybody here from the mayor and administration know how much this facility cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| The reason I don't know offhand is because this facility was built probably ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| So there was an acquisition of the property at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| And a lot of the work was done years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| So I would have to go back and just research exactly what was spent on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| I wouldn't even know where to begin to tell you what that dollar amount was because it was done so long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| I mean, it's like how many acres site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| It's much larger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Plus we've got an office on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Plus there's a large part of it is what's called roller compacted concrete was installed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| There's been design work to draw up all these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| The acquisition of the property in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| So there's several costs there that just need to be added up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| A lot of this was done, like I said, in the magnitude of ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| I just don't --I can't recall what the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| We have a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Someone second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| I'm trying to get to a point here that with Mr. Draper or the operator, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=986)|
| 0:16:34| would you agree to pay $5,000 a month rent for the next three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| Commissioner, I just, my client's free to stand up here and tell you what he chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| But I just, we're not going to stand here and negotiate with the county in this setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| I mean, the law director has expressed this and Mr. Weetrix expressed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| And I just, I understand the concerns that you have about a revenue share provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| and a contract that was never paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| From day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| But I'm not going to stand at this podium and negotiate and, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| stand here in a county commission meeting and mediate my client's claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| We're just not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Do we get a second on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| We still have some lights on after the lights are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Law Director, the bottom line as far as Knox County is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| you reiterated the fact that we have a six-year statute of limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| I don't want you to reveal any negotiations or anything, but where are we in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| Have mediation meetings been set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Do we have a court hearing date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Where are we in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| What we have currently is a False Claims Act litigation, which began through Mr. Mays and his attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| We have, I have hired an attorney to investigate that to see if there is any fraud involved throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1082)|
| 0:18:13| So far, we have not encountered fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| What we have is what's been explained a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| We have deviations from the terms of the contract on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| What I would prefer to do is to take a member of this commission, whoever it is that you would wish to appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1108)|
| 0:18:37| with us to a mediation with a contractor and to see if there is a way to get to some meeting of the minds of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1117)|
| 0:18:51| subject to coming back to this body for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| You know, what you have is the contractor is supposed to make a quarterly payment to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| We agreed to a revenue sharing provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| In addition to that, we're to pay tipping fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| And they have a right to increase that fee, automatically to increase that fee, every year according to the CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| They have not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| They're going to ask us for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| We're going to ask us for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| We're going to ask them for the $1.50 per cubic yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| I don't know how that weighs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| But I'm sure we can come to some terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| At least we will be able to decide where everything lays through mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1175)|
| 0:19:45| It's a mediation that we would take Bruce Weitrick with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Bruce Weitrick has stood here before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| It's somewhat unorthodox for us to basically litigate a contract through a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| It's very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| As your attorney, it's not something that we ordinarily do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| It has basically been somewhat litigated from the lectern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| You understand Mr. Weitrick's, Bruce Weitrick's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| Bruce Weitrick has made certain statements that will be considered to be admissions against interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| I think both sides have deviated from the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| And both sides need to come to terms through some agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| What I would prefer to see instead of entering into terminating the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| which is about to expire in just a little over 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| there is a new RFP out, I trust that this contractor is going to bid on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| They may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| They may decide not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| If they bid on it and if we determine at some point through the litigation that is already present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| that there is fraud involved, then their contract will be terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| if they are the recipient of the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| I would prefer to at least continue on with the status quo for the next 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| with perhaps through the length of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| we've been going on for about five and a half years already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| with the commission appointing one of its members to sit with us through a mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| to see if we can bring back an agreement to this body which would bring a resolution to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| With that, Mr. Chairman, I will make a substitute motion that we do what the law director stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| that you, Mr. Chairman, appoint someone to act on behalf of the commission for mediation to join with Mr. Owings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| and then whatever else Mr. Owings said as part of the motion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| I'll make that in the form of a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| I have a friendly amendment that we stop paying the tipping fees until the end of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1319)|
| 0:22:09| I think that was a general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| They're not paying us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Let's just not pay them and then it will all be settled in court anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| Would you accept that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| No, I would rather go ahead and just have everything through mediation, so no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| We have a substitute motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Well, you know, I was concerned, really concerned when we asked in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| if they were in compliance and then they come back in September and say they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| You know, this would have all been over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| But listening to John there, it sounds to me like both sides are sort of broke the contract there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| There are issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| You know, this would be for the owner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I've forgotten your name, sir, pardon me, but if you don't mind, step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| I said Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I really appreciate you, the good faith deal there on the tipping fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| But we're going into the mulching season right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Would you be willing to pay whichever one is greater, the dollar and a half or the 23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| I don't think we're going to complicate matters there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| This is a simple way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| I can go along with the 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| You said that in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I don't think I'm even being advised to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| So it's an easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| I don't think you have either, according to your lawyer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| But you've made that statement that you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| So I feel like you're a man of your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Well, if he is agreeable to do that, Commissioner, then we need to make that in the form of an amendment to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| That's what I just tried to do, that we not pay the tipping fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| Well, this was not the contract we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| This was just a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| My feeling is that if he voluntarily decides to do it, I mean, do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| I mean, you've said you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| And so if this is something you want to do, you know, that you want to do, I don't know why we need a resolution to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| You've told us that you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| And so I'm not going to include that to make you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| But if you want to do it voluntarily, I think that's a very generous gesture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| I don't think it's any different than waiving a CPI increase, which we voluntarily did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| Well, I think that just becomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| I think that just becomes part of the mediation anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| I mean, if we're sitting down, we're trying to figure out who owes what, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| maybe that's a factor that becomes part of mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Here again, like I said to begin with, this contract is over sometime late June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1473)|
| 0:24:43| Mr. Law Director, if we were to terminate the contract and then we were found that we were in violation of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| and we didn't and do we owe, are we liable for not having just cause for terminating the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1492)|
| 0:25:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| If that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| I mean, ultimately what you would have, if you terminate the contract with a 15-day notice and a 30-day notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| you've got 45 days or so left without a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| They may have had 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Probably without a contractor on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| They would have additional damages to claim as part of any lawsuit that derives from such a move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1517)|
| 0:25:26| Well, I think that, you know, if we can mediate this and not have to go through the final stages of a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| That's why I'm going to vote in favor of the mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| And does the, I guess the chairman is going to name who the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| I would prefer that we go ahead and name that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| That's what I was getting ready to say is that to go ahead and have the chairman appoint someone from this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| to sit on that and go ahead and name him now or her now and so that it can be part of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1553)|
| 0:26:02| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Yeah, because any other way I had to wait until committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| Commissioner Moore, is this something that you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| If this commission would want me to, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| If it don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Well, they gave me the authority, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| If you asked me to, Mr. Chairman, I'd serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| I'm asking you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| And then I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Like you asked me for the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| And that will be part of the motion as the chairman has asked Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| Commissioner Moore will be part of the resolution to be the representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| We'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| 8-0-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Mr. Chairman, was there a companion resolution 9-20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| I think there was a second companion resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| There was a resolution 9-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| I'm sorry, 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Is that right, Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Yeah, 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Not necessarily a companion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Well, they're both related to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Well, one of them is just related in general, not to natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| But if the commission would like to go ahead with 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| Let's hear that now since interested parties are still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| I'm sure they're paying Mr. Draper by the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| And I'd like to save them whatever I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| You can go ahead with 9-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| This resolution prohibits Knox County from contracting with any company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| person, firm, or other entity who is a party in a lawsuit opposing Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| Mr. Law Director, if you want to explain it, you can probably do it better than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Mr. Holt, do you want to come to the lectern, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| I've had several discussions with Hugh and with Matt, who came with Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| to try to accomplish what Commissioner Moore desires through this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1699)|
| 0:28:28| One way that we can do that, I believe, is through the language of the resolution where we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| the purchasing director to change the regulations, to change the purchasing regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1717)|
| 0:28:45| This way we don't get involved in an ordinance, which requires two readings or anything else of that magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| We're looking for a change in the regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| To add a section to debarring vendors, we have a debarment provision in our regs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1734)|
| 0:29:04| which requires the senior director of finance, upon the recommendation of the purchasing director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| to remove or debar vendors for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| One reason would be for violating a contract provisions of a character which is serious enough to justify debarment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| for violating ethical standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| for a conviction under state or federal antitrust statutes arising out of submission of bids or proposals, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| This would add a provision which would provide that the senior director of finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| upon the recommendation of the purchasing director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| can remove or debar vendors if any company, if that vendor, any company, person, firm, or other entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1779)|
| 0:29:50| is a party in a lawsuit opposing Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| So it's an additional consideration under the debarment provision of our regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| The regulations are enacted basically with the director of purchasing writing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1801)|
| 0:30:14| with the law director signing off, with the mayor signing off, with the senior director of finance signing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| That's correct. You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| They do not come back to commission, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| This is a way, I believe, Commissioner Moore, you can answer whether it is satisfactory to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| but it was a way that when we put our heads together that we came up with to address your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| And I think the city of Knoxville has one similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| And I think what it does is, like I've heard before, it gives Mr. Holt a tool to put in a tool belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| If he can use it at certain points in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| that's another option he has to look at at a company that's bidding on county contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| So I'll make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| We'll get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| We have some likes on Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| Yes, I had some concerns about this particular resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| And, again, it gets back to the term unintentional consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| You can have a gas truck that's delivering gas to one of the stations where maybe the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| or someone is they refuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| You can have a county car that gets away and maybe damages some company's vehicle that does business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1900)|
| 0:31:49| with the county and either the county is suing that company or the company is suing the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| because it just can't be resolved through mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| And it doesn't mean that someone's not living up to their contract or doing what they're supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| but they would be barred from business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| And you could think of many, many other circumstances, even a contractual dispute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| that really doesn't imply fraud or doesn't imply ill intentions or someone not living up to the contents of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| contract, but it just needs judicial judgment to say who's right and who's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| And for this reason, I think I would oppose this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| I'm going to agree with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| I think that it does that as well because I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| You know, we have school bus contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| We have, you know, the city of Knoxville sued us not too long ago with regard to stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| So does that mean that we can't do business with the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| Or I just, I don't think it's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| And one of the things that concerns me is that you could have competitors come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| and file some sort of lawsuit to where you would not be allowed to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| And it just sets up a bad precedent in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Hugh and I have talked numerous times about purchasing ideology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| I just think any time that you put something in that restricts his ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| right now he has the ability to restrict certain vendors because of performance, performance guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| And if you add this, then as Hugh and I have talked many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| not only do you take things out of the toolbox, but you also limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| if we don't perform, you know, in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| if for some reason the county can't take something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| a manufactured product that somebody is supposed to be delivering on time for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| salt, for example, or road conditioner for the wintertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| We need it, but we can't get it because, you know, we're overstocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| And you wind up, if they sue us because we haven't taken it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| then you wind up harming them for something that we're responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| The law cuts both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| I'm with the rest of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| The unintended consequences, it's, I mean, anything could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| I mean, basically, someone could tell a vendor, we're not going to pay this bill you owe us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| and then they'll be, okay, well, we'll sue you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| And then they're like, yeah, well, then you can't ever bid on any county contracts again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| I'd see how this, is there any other way to deal with this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| without going to these draconian measures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| Because it really puts us in a situation where vendors will be afraid to litigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| against Knox County, even when we're in the wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| We can address this on a case-by-case basis through the solicitation itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| and determine whether or not, in each particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| whether there is merit to seek this type of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| I will agree with Commissioner Lambert that this could become a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| And does this have further reaching implications outside of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Does that mean that boards that are part of Knox County that happen to enter into litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| and the NPC, a KGIS, an E911, is that, does that reflect back onto the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| and affect the county, the public building authority being one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| Mr. Holt, let me just stop you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Mr. Chairman, I'll just withdraw this resolution, and that way we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| That was a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| You can't withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| I made the substitute, you did, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| There wasn't a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Oh, I'm old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| You're thinking of a time before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| It's time to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| It just about is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| And that's something that we may need to discuss is how late we're going to allow these meetings to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| And how late is it that we're no longer doing the public good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| 8.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| Page 14, 8.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| This is a resolution enabling the Knox County Law Director to take any action necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| to fully implement a resolution to the Knox County Auditor's findings and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| following his review of purchasing card charges and expense reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| We're on 8.03?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| They approved it 6.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| They approved N.O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Can I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Property motion and property second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Those of us on beer board now have been here for six and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| And I think Commissioner Luthold has a very valid point, and that is how long do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Are we serving the public good at midnight and 1 a.m., trying to conduct the public business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| I think most people would agree that we're probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| That's one of the reasons why I wanted to bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| It's Resolution 919, but it kind of goes along with this, so I thought I would go ahead and bring it up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| This is not something that's very comfortable, I think, for any of us to want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| but I believe that we need to, and I believe that we need to come to some form of resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| with regards to the audits that have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| The first audit which came out was released on September the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| which was the audit of the travel allowance and the automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| The second audit with regards to the P-card came out several days ago with the response this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| It's now being sent back to the comptroller and our internal auditor for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| and they will issue another report for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| And I believe that we as a body need to go ahead and meet and address these two audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| And so what I'm putting up for discussion is a special call meeting of this body for April the 24th at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2308)|
| 0:38:37| The reason I chose April 24th was simply because this room's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| And I'm checking with the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| April 23rd is also available, and I'll mention that in just a second, but April 24th is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| This also gives us plenty of time to get the report back from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| from our local auditor with the final recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| We can look at it and have a discussion as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| It would be my suggestion that we have here a representative from the Attorney General's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| that we have a representative from the comptroller's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| that we have our internal auditor here, that we have our law director here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| that we have representatives of the mayor's office here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| Now, I'm not suggesting that this be a 202H investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| because I believe that if we do a 202H, that we need to have procedures in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| we need to have set guidelines for how we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| My concern is that we have a professional, businesslike, but above all, a civil discussion of what we want to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2375)|
| 0:39:48| Where do we want to go with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Do we ask the Attorney General to take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| Do we ask our law director to take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Do we have a 202H investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| And if we do, we should set up the guidelines for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| But I'm suggesting that we go ahead and have a special meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| and the reason, again, I'm asking for a special meeting is I think it's important that we be clear of mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| and that we focus on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| This is extremely important, and it's important that we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| I know we all want to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| and I think that at some point, we as a body have got to sit down and talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| and determine what action, if any, that we're going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| And so, Mr. Law Director, with regards to the resolution that's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| I do not have a problem with your taking any action to do the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| I know that you've already talked about Ms. Finch's freezing her pay and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| I have no issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| I just wanted to bring forward for discussion, maybe this is not the time to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| but it is related that we have a special...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| And I'm not sold on April 24th, if there's another date, as long as this room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| So I put that out for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| I'm not available on April 24th, so I think the room is available on April 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| We also have a Board of Zoning Appeals meeting that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| I will be in town on the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| The 23rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Yes, the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| This room is available at 6 o'clock as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| We should be through with the Board of Zoning Appeals by 5 or earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| I would like to make, on the time, the 23rd is fine, probably if we could do it around 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2484)|
| 0:41:33| The only issue on the 23rd is, again, the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| I know. It starts at 1.30. It's usually over by 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| So if we did it at 4, there's none of us that don't have to go somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| and come back three hours later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Okay. I have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Again, that's not set in stone, just the idea that we're in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| BZA usually takes about less than an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| I mean, we could set it even earlier at 3 if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| It doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| If you want to say immediately following 3 p.m. or immediately following 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| Certainly. I have no issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| I think we need to set a certain date and time for the ones that are not at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| It's Wednesday, the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| I know we'd probably be done by 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| Say 3.30 and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| 3 o'clock or immediately following BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| That was Resolution 919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| And the way I saw the agenda, 907 would have come before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| would also have sort of dealt with the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| It was a resolution of the Commission of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| to exercise subpoena and contempt powers or as such arise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| necessitated by the implications from the audit of the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| And from my understanding, about eight months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| there was a resolution that passed from this body to subpoena on another audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| And at that time, the law director did not have a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| and did not know of a process to go ahead and continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| And so, Mr. Law Director, since I was not a commissioner at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| could you explain about the subpoena powers that had passed from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| and about a process for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Title 2H of our charter has never been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| What it anticipates is that this body would convene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| on the one hand, for the purposes of an investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| to investigate any possible violations of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| We were asked to come up with some rules for the commission to live by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| I have those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| They were prepared back then, but we, the subject basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| never came up again for a vote on a specific 202H hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| And so, I have not passed out the proposed rules that we've come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| In addition to that, though, if you're talking about subpoenaing witnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| we really don't have any parameters for that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| What we have is a charter provision that provides that this body may subpoena witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| We don't know exactly what that encompasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| In my view, we really need an ordinance to lay all of that out, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| if you're going to use subpoena powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Yes, you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| We don't know what they are, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| And that's the clearest way I know how to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| It is certainly unlike a court where we have certain rules that apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| None of those rules apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| I have rules for the conduct of a 202H hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| We've prepared those as far as the order of the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| and what is to occur at the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| For instance, witnesses have the right to assert their rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| They have their right to assert their rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| under the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| It can be quite an involved process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| We're certainly willing to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| But if we're going to use subpoena powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| then we need to, through an ordinance, provide some parameters for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| It may be that the witnesses will appear and testify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| without the use of a subpoena power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| that they will take an oath and be sworn in and testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| We've never had a witness to appear before this body to do such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| Okay, Mr. Law Director, I have received countless phone calls, emails, and faxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| even people referencing our county charter that it was violated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| stating Section 2557, any county official or officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| who knowingly, willfully, or unintentionally spends or obligates amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| in excess of the appropriations, which you know the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| So I'm wondering, how can we be certain that the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| who we have pertinent questions directed towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| how can we be certain that they will arrive at whatever meeting that we plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| without using some, or even our limited subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| that don't have much definition behind them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| Well, you can't be certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| I mean, we, you know, what is the enforcement of a commission subpoena?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| We don't have any description of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| We don't have a mechanism in place to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| We, you know, can you take a person to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Well, under what authority do we have for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| It's not like we have an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Basically, you're in the legal process through a court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| and you're issued a subpoena to be in attendance at a court hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Certainly, the court has the authority to order your appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| Here, we have not defined that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| You know, Mr. Law Director, I had studied the report for Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| It's about congressional investigations and subpoena and contempt powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| Pretty extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| It is very extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| And from what I try to gather, it seems to me that even Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| used powers that weren't necessarily explicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| to come to the bottom of things with the Watergate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| And I know that this is nothing in comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| but that they tried to use powers that weren't necessarily explicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| or written out in order to get to the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| because the confidence in the government body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| had been put into such question and had been marred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| and the confidence had been misplaced in public trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| And so, I'm just wondering, there is a lot of public eye cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| There is a lot of public, I don't know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| could I just see a raise of hand how many commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| have received phone calls and faxes and emails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| So, I mean, there is an outcry and I just want to know what can we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| I know that you're saying that really we have no power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| We have subpoena power with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Without definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| You can conduct a 202H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| You can ask for persons to come and testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| You can ask for cooperation from whoever it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| that you wish to come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Whether you have an enforcement power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| to get that person here is another matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| I'd just like to respond to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Mr., our law director has quite a volume of information here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| with regards to a 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| It would be my feeling that in order to take this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| it's going to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| And we're going to need to study this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| and this is why I'm asking for this special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Perhaps we could take this information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| when we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| We'll have it here in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| But it just seems to me that we all want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| We all want to be responsive to our constituencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| We all want to be responsive to our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| But it just seems to me that the prudent thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| would be to have a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| where we focus on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| The report of September the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| the report which will be coming out in a matter of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| and Mr. Walls tells me it will be 7 to 10 working days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| We'll have that in plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| We will be able to sit down, look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| request these folks to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| and determine at that time what action we want to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| It could be that it would be a 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| It could be that it would be anything in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| But to be able to come in and sit down as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| and address this, I think that we need to do it sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| And if October the 23rd is a date that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| or April 23rd, then let's do it on April 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| I'd like to ask the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Mayor, could you come down to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| I want to ask you a question and then while he's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Mr. Hammond, I wanted to see if you'd be in agreement with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| You mentioned the people that you would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| and I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Do you also not think that we need to ask the state auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| to sit on this also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Yes, I'd mention the state comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| The individuals I mentioned were a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| of the Attorney General's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| a representative of the state comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| our internal auditor, our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| and would like to extend the invitation as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| to our mayor to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| I guess I want to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Mayor, will you be here on the 23rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| Not only will we be here, we'll be delighted to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Let me also add one statement to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| When you look at our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| if you decide to use subpoena powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| the executive branch is going to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| to extend those same powers to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| so if you consider to go forward with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| we have the right to ask as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| and we'll be exercising that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Here's where I'm at with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| and we voted on this several months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| and I was the only one that said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| I feel like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| the mayor is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| He's not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| If you tell him who we need, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| if you'll tell us who from the staff that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| or the auditor, Richard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| you tell us who we need here on that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| they will be here and then if they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| they know they're going to be subpoenaed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| I want to hold a little bit of dignity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| with what's out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| But to go out and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| we're going to subpoena people that are upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| I just think that makes us look bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| and everybody's fighting against each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| I don't think the man's going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| I'm anxious to hear what he's got to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| and the other people from the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| and let's get this behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I think it's a cry and shame that we have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| we have to subpoena this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| I mean, he's always here when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Anything else that we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Yes, this is for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| This 9-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| that Commissioner Hammond's got there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| how's that going to affect 9-13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3149)|
| 0:52:48| It would be my hope that when the Law Director comes, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3168)|
| 0:53:15| that he would be prepared to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| I'd like to get it all on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| and get it all addressed on April 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Well, I'd like to have an answer to it too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| when he gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| We've been trying to get to the bottom of this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| for over seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| We've asked for these subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| and we've talked about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| and it's been over seven months now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| and we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| I hear this, we need to do it sooner than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| but when is sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Yes, I've got a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Yes, I've got a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Mr. Owings, I thought back a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| we did do subpoena power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| on the auto travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| and then we waited on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| and we had one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| I thought we were getting ready to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| in a small assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| and I think the mayor showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| with his council and a few other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| showed up with their council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| and then you said you hadn't had time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| because you've been in the Sunshine Law trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| that you hadn't had time to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Probably a pretty good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| You hadn't had time to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| process down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| but I thought on the auto travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| we already had approved a 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| You know, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| I honestly don't remember. I've slept since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| I believe you're correct, we did do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| But with that, this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| has told the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| that it's our right to keep the auto travel money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| They did that in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| So, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| that's a mute point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| unless the commission decides to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| on their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| I have been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| critic of the auto travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| and said that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| I think Richard Wall said it was improper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| the state comptroller said it was improper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| but this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| went ahead and did something that different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| So, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| that one, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| if it needs to be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| back up, or I guess we could with two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Well, perhaps it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| On April 23rd, if we gather and decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| that we don't need to do that, then that just saves us time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| But if it's like anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| and I'll be quiet, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| if we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| going to do anything except, say, mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| or do something else, we don't need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| waste our time to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| Commissioner Powlett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I have a question for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Law Director. John, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| recall, now I believe it was on a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| by Mark Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| that did with utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| out somewhere where the telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| company delayed moving their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| poles for considerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| time and actually cost us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| in excess of $900,000. Didn't we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| pass to use subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| on all contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| now that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| does with lenders, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| Commissioner, again, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| don't know, I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| If this body wishes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| exercise subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| through a 202-H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| that's where you find it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| is in a 202-H investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| then we need to set the parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| for that. We would do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| through an ordinance, through two readings of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Well, you anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| my question. The best way to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| like if they move, it's not just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| this, but since we brought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| up, we couldn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| whichever provider it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| and Bruce may recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| this if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| And it cost us almost a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| I think the recommendation at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| time is that if they wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| come to the podium voluntarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| that we put in future contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| with Knox County that we could use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| And in anticipation of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| question then, maybe if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Mr. Freeze would think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| removing this, you provide us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| materials and maybe she would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| want to make an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| within 60 or 90 days, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| That's my only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Or statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| There was a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| I guess my question is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Richard Walls. Richard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| report of the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| will be when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| have a chance to go back and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| what the mayor's response is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Yes, once we review the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| mayor's response and review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| with the state, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| we're awaiting responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| from the former employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| through their attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Do you anticipate having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| that done by the 23rd of April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| The deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| that was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| by the mayor's office was the 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| working days, and that's what we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| working under. And technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| that would be Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| would be the end of those 20 working days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| And that's what I have relayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| to the attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| representing the former employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| Okay, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| I just feel that if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| meet on the 23rd, we need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| the absolute final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| report so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| what we need in order to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| So I just wanted to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| you would feel comfortable with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| 23rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| having everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| so that we can review it at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| point in time, if not before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| And it all depends on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| the responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| We've been constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| in the last, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| the release of the draft, it's almost like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| the immaculate conception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| We've been getting receipts that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| asked for for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| And so if we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| to get items that we still have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| review, we will need more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| depending on what the responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| are is when we'll be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| to deliver the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| And until we get those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| we won't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| But possibly April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| 23rd is doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| It just remains to be seen based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| the responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Let me say, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Mr. Walz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| presents a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| final report on the 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| don't expect your law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| to have an opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| April the 23rd, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| We're going to need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| a little while to work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| I would expect it much sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| He has to wait on responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| And then you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| to wait on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| I'm all in favor of doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| the 23rd, but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| feel that when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| finally meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| to try to make whatever decision that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| decide to make, we need to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| absolute final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Otherwise, we're back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| What I'm hearing is that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| sounds good and it may be possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| but we're not absolute sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| We have a commission meeting on April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| the 27th, 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Or we'd have committees on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| 21st, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| And we would know at that time whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| or not we're going to be prepared on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| 23rd. And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| I'm just sort of giving a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| warning that it may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| possible that if things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| aren't done in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| and Mr. Walz's report's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| not done in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| or if it's not done in time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| the law director to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| What I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| when I mentioned those dates is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| make a decision then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| I was just wanting to ask and see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| the two people that are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| coming forward with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| pertinent information for us to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| our decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| we need that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Otherwise, we're not going to be able to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| a decision. But I'm supportive of the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Maybe we should wait until September 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| You know, I'm with R. Larry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| about the subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| for the folks that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| here. And I was one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| first ones to ask for subpoena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| powers. But I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| to subpoena someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| wasn't here. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| mayor has always been forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| We've disagreed many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| But he's always been available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| worried about any current staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| members when it comes to these audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| What I'm worried about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| former staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| is there a way that we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| selectively so that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| embarrass a current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| staffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| who's operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| in good faith and voluntarily coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| down here, but where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| can still selectively use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| the subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| for former staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| get them to answer some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| Can we selectively do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| You can selectively do that at a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| your wishes will be made known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| to the folks that are sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| the media and the television audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Yeah, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Richard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| when we had talked earlier, you had told me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| you felt like that you would have the information in 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| to 10 days. It sounds like now you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| saying that it may be longer than that. Am I reading that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| It really all depends on the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| We weren't aware when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| talked about the initial response that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| all these documents were suddenly going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| appearing. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| every time we get new documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| we have to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| look at them, go see the originals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| to make sure they are originals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| and that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| of thing. So it really just depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| on what the responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| are that we do receive. Do you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| we can make April the 23rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| I mean, have it before... I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| And I'll let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| if we do run into problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| I know we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| on the floor. I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| that we approve 803 with an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| we have a meeting on April the 23rd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| at 3.30 p.m. to hear the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| report on his recommendations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| implementations, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| matters that the law director would want to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| forward to us with regards to these audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| That we also extend an invitation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Attorney General, Comptroller's Office, the Internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Auditor, the Law Director, as mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| as well as our Mayor's staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| to be a part of this special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| And it would just look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| the travel allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| and the PCARD audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| And if Mr. Walls feels that he can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| make that, he lets us know at our committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| and we can look at another date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| The issue is getting this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| And that's why it's difficult to select| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| a date until we can check with PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| because this room's not available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| a lot and I think it's important to be on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| and that the public be able to see these proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| If you could let us know on our committee days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| if we have to postpone it, we could probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| do it then and check with the PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| and find out what dates might be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Mr. Hammond, what about former employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| having those here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| I think we can make a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| Or their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| representatives. I don't have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| subpoenaing those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| We can make the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| We have a substitute motion on the floor. Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| So I would effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| withdraw 919 and make this amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| number 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| We're still on 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| We withdraw 919 later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Well, I'll just wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| until we get to 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| I think one of the things, Richard and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| was just conversing, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| an audit is a working document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| until not only he gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| the receipts that are going to be turned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| or turned in, but then he may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| have additional questions. I mean, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| auditors do. They try to dig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| They ask more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| If the answers aren't what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| they believe they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| So just because he gets in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| all of his documentation by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| the first of next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| doesn't mean he's done asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| I mean, it's kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| it's an investigation where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| continually go through the different steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| until you get to a point that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| got a definitive answer on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| any questions you've got. And they all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| have to be answered. Is that not correct, Richard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| Just, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| about to, I guess, talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| 907, which deals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| the subpoena and content powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| It seems the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| work for the county, we're not going to have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| difficulty getting them to appear and answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| our questions. And even if we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| the subpoena powers for those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| who are no longer employed by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| I think the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| that we would be interested in, they would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| exercise their right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| under the Fifth Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| Mr. Law Director, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| a reasonable assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| for the information that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| be interested in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| I quit assuming long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| know what folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| who no longer work for the county would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| do in response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| a request or a subpoena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| don't have any way of knowing. I've not talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| with any of them about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Could we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| add the language in there that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| write a letter to these former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| employees asking them to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| and make that part of the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| And then if they show up, they show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| up. If they don't, they don't. I don't think we had said that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| extend the invitation to them or their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| to be here. Okay. If it's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| I mean, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| This question is for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| John, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| at BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| you put people under oath, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| if they're going to testify. Now, what kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| power do we have if people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| misrepresent what they're telling the BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| I mean, we may put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| persons under oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| but we don't have subpoena power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| through BZA to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| compel someone to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| to the meeting. Okay. Say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| the administration comes and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| We can also put persons under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| Put them under oath. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| If they desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| to speak to us. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| I think that might be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| If everybody shows up and before they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| start answering questions, we put them under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Since 907 got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| brought back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Mr. Law Director, I was wanting to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| if maybe you could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| some information maybe together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| for us for our agenda meeting in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| about a process or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| pushing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| No, I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| that we could follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| for a 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| What I don't have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| a make-up of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| what all would be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| through a subpoena process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| How long would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| that take since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| other instances have been brought to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| that we may need that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| How long would that reasonably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| take your department to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| generate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| I can do my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| What you're asking me to do is prepare an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| for the next commission meeting and I'll do my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| to do that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| And then with your agreement to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| I would like to withdraw 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4195)|
| 1:10:03| We can wait until we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| All in favor say aye. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| We're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4223)|
| 1:10:35| Okay. Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| It's authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| the sale of surplus property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| upon such terms as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| will secure the highest and best price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| withdrew it, 6-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Did we not go ahead and withdraw everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| on the agenda to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| Yeah, that's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| We didn't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| How about 905?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| This resolution is instructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| the Knox County Law Director and the Knox County Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| to institute a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| whistleblower program for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| Vote at 6-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| It doesn't have anything for finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Probably 10-0 to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| No recommendation for finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| I'll make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| that we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| And then I'll explain what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| I met with Mr. Owings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| and the State has a whistleblower program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| What I'm asking the Commission to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| is to ask our Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| and our Auditor to get together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| look at the State law and implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| a whistleblower program here locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| which would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| employees, citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| if they suspect broader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| abuse, to contact the Auditor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| office. We would also look at establishing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| hotline so that people would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| to do that. But we're not asking you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| to approve that. We're asking the Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| and the Auditor to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| and bring to us a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| which we can publicize it, have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| telephone number, and let everyone know that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| indeed is a whistleblower program in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| And what you're going to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| in State law, we already have a whistleblower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| act. I mean, it's already law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| So we very well may incorporate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| But what Commissioner Hammond has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| suggested is that we have our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| hotline, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| who's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| to answer that hotline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| that it's probably going to be Mr. Wall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| office. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| It's probably going to be Mr. Wall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Mr. Wall has been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| in a number of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| over the past year or so. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| how much traffic he's going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| as a result of a hotline number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| But I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| we can take that as it goes. Mr. Wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| I'm speaking for you, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| it may be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| a hotline generates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| enough traffic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| he needs more help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| But we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| be glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| talk with Mr. Walls and bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| you something back. And that's the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| intent, is look at it, bring it to us, and if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| not feasible, it's not feasible. But my sense is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| it probably would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| We all know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| That was one of the things I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| going to ask you, was a cost. Is there a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| to find out a cost associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| that you could incorporate it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| when you bring it back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| See, virtually right now, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| would be no cost. It depends upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| the number of persons who utilize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| number. And we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| post it on the Knox County website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| through a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| We have a motion on the floor. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| Who wants to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4446)|

| 1:14:22| and content powers, or as such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| arise, necessitated by the implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| from the audit of the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Questions are free. Yes, at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| I'd like to withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| Oh, the whistleblower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4484)|

| 1:15:02| I was waiting to see what they were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Resolution 908| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4504)|

| 1:15:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Some questions in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| to this, Commissioner. Is this the one where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| persons would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| commissioners would go online and communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| through a website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Yes, and I've been in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| with Representative Dunn on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| bill, and also with John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Owens, and also with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| technical people of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| county. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| would actually, there were some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| that Dunn has just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| kind of clued me into. He said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| set up a password| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| type of forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| on the internet, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| the design, we could design it however we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| The public comments could be set up on maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| a different website, but not necessarily this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| This is because this would be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| actually in spirit with the law with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Open Meetings Act that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Commissioner DeFries, may I interrupt for just a second over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| It would be a password for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| post, but it would be open for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| any member of the public to view the post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| That's very important. Yes, and that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| have to, they said that the records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| everything that we would post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| the records would be archived for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| a year, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| the websites would have to be publicized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Knoxville News Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| knoxcounty.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| and he also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| indicated that the technology is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| for those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| maybe on commission who don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| comfortable with their computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| skills. He said that he thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| that technology is there for phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| conversations to be recorded as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| audio files that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| public would be able to listen to in real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| time, and then also to be set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| in a database. And I see John Owings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| shaking his head. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| one of the things that it would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| is, this is one of those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| where we would need to go back before the Chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| be allowed an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| This is certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| currently not the law now, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| if it passes, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| want to go back to court to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| the judge was aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| and approved of this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| But in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| New Sentinel has a website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4676)|

| 1:18:00| takes, I guess you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| register and you can blog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| I do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4684)|

| 1:18:08| I read them a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| of times and they brought me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| to a new low, and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| quit reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| anonymous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| bloggers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| on the Knox News| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| website. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| what you have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| administratively, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| the New Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| you know, they make available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| that site, but it comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| And the cost is they have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| someone there monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| the site and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| striking comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| that may ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| put them in the middle of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| So it is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| something to consider if we ever get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Yes, but John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| Owings, Bill Dunn and I were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| speaking and he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| indicating that this forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| would be more for public record of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| our communication, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| necessarily for the public, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| they're not under the injunction or underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| the Open Meetings Act. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| we wouldn't necessarily have to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| since we already have on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| ways for them to contact us already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| And this actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| would just provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| we would encourage that the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| County delegation support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| Bill Dunn's House Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| And right now, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| Senate Bill, the Partner Bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| is being put on hold for a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| to see what the House Bill does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| John, do you have any more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| okay that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| considered passing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| on the third party?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| Your third party?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| We, this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| may vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| any and encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| our legislative delegation to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| certain acts and this is certainly appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Well, this is just okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| if the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| were to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| the Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| are we still under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| the injunction as the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| the old Open Meetings Act is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| or the new law that would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| The way this court's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| memorandum in order reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| he doesn't tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| that this is the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| that, you know, provided there are any amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| that we are an exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| that we may follow the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Before we were to enact anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| like this, before we were to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| in anything like this, we would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| to make certain of that because, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| you're all's pocketbook and your liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| are at stake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| and so we would make certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| Well, I'm not necessarily just talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| about this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| as a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| but if the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| changed any part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Open Meetings Act, I mean, would we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| fall under whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| new law is or would we have to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| to fall under the old law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| I understand your question. I would hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| that we would fall under the new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| again, I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| not one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| to make assumptions and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| would go back and ask the court for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| Mr. Dunn did a presentation to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| in Nashville when we were on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Open Meetings Committee and, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Commissioner DeVries is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| What he is looking for is a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| that officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| can communicate and not violate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| the Sunshine Law. And his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| suggestion was that we do exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| what had been suggested, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| there be a website. If I wanted to have lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| with Commissioner Lambert, I could post on that website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Commissioner Lambert, can you have lunch Thursday at 12 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| He would respond and say yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| and it would be password protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| and the public could go and see that and know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| that we were having lunch. The issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| of course, is would the judge view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| that as adequate public notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| So, there are a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| issues here. I did receive a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| on Thursday from CTAS saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| that the latest thing was to make Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| County a pilot program for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| That we would be able to come in and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| if Knox County could implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| this and see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| things are going. A lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| questions about this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| regards to, A, would the judge allow us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| it? B, would the commissioners use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| C, would the public view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| that as a means of adequate public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| notice to know what's going on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| terms of conversation between commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| even though it is on a website and it's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| 24-7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| So, I don't have a problem in supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| this to see where it goes because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| anything we can do to communicate with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| I think is a good idea, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| there are some pitfalls along the way, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| the bottom line is the judge would really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| to agree to allow us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Commissioner McKinley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| am I correct in saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| House and Senate bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| would be geared toward the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| state's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Open Meetings Act Sunshine Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| and not the injunction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| So, there may be potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5014)|

| 1:24:00| resolution as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| is that these are really unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| mandates. We don't know what the costs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| associated with this. It's great to have a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| but once you deal with the number, are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| going to send out an investigator? Are you going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| follow-up on investigators? Is it going to be an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5052)|

| 1:24:18| a website that we can post to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| The public may want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| an opportunity to post to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5062)|

| 1:24:26| open meetings. If this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| in spirit with having an open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5068)|

| 1:24:32| this doesn't accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5072)|

| 1:24:36| in terms of security, in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| someone out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5078)|

| 1:24:46| we need to be real careful and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5086)|

| 1:29:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| I'd like to recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Is this a voluntary sale or is any eminent domain being used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| Voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| It's a voluntary sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Yeah, I was just in question of what I was reading in the paper today about we're paying $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| I think you said that the city has given us $150,000 of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| But it's showing on tax rolls it's only valued at $86,900 while we're paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5389)|
| 1:29:56| Could I answer that, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| I believe back when we were negotiating the deal on the first piece of property that they told us the appraisal on this was $180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| And I said we need to try to buy this piece first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| And this commission, the old commission, let me put it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| they made a recommendation that we pay up to the $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| And I said at that time, that's what we're going to have to pay the people when you make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| Appraised at $180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| So we made that recommendation, voted on it to pay the $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| So now we're having to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| It came back in an appraisal either $170,000 or $180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| And that was done here several months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Lately, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| When's the last time these tax rolls were that $80,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| What's the date on this $86,900?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| If it's a four-year scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| Well, it would have been 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| Were there any changes made to this when it was valued in 05?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| Have there been any changes out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| Well, I mean, without access to the website to know if there's been an adjustment, I couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5459)|
| 1:31:12| The property assessor assesses property every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| And they did it in 01, they did it in 05, they're going to do it in 09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| The property assessor, that's county-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| Now, the property assessor can go any other year and reassess property in between those four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5482)|
| 1:31:29| And whether or not they've done that since 05, I wouldn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| There's no way of knowing without looking at the property assessor's information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| So who's by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Is Hugh Holt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Is this his department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| Is this what Hugh does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Phil will get this straight in a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| He's going home to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| The reason that this is back before you, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| is because there are going to be some costs associated with the removal of the gasoline storage tank that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5512)|
| 1:32:04| And it may be in excess of $20,000 or so, but that cost, that's a reasonable estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| That's why it's back before you, because there is another cost that you don't read here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| but what you've done, you've approved up to $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| but with that consideration that there may be more to it than just the $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| But we do have the $150,000 from the city, so hopefully there's enough money there to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| Okay, Mr. Pinkston, I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| You're talking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| Mr. Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| Who's a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| Daniels and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Oh, Daniels and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| We'll write their names down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Write their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Take their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| Ayes and two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| Resolution 912 to fully utilize the Knox County Finance Committee's authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| under Knox County Code Section 2554A to approve all line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5597)|
| 1:33:25| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5605)|
| 1:33:33| What number are we on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| 912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| 912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| 6-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| But I'd like a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| I'll make a second to move towards discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5633)|
| 1:34:04| What this is about, you know, you're making line item transfers here somehow that we don't know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| On the travel allowance, you changed that over from a travel allowance, created a new journal to put it in salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5650)|
| 1:34:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| Yeah, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| And that was based on Mr. Vandervate's communication with the county commission to call it salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5660)|
| 1:34:28| He wrote a letter to the county commission and said this, in fact, was salaries, should be treated as salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| and that communication was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| Yeah, I got the letter, but I don't think we voted on that or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| The other thing here that I'm really concerned about is these community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| You know, on this Family Security Incorporated, we disbursed $33,454.04 to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5686)|
| 1:34:59| HUD refused to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Now, we voted to give them this money, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| Now, there's a line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| How did you transfer that over to the Knoxville Academy of Medicine without us voting on a line item transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| And where does this $33,454.00 come from that the county has already put out to give this National Academy of Medicine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5713)|
| 1:35:25| Where did the $34,000.00 roughly come from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| Through our community grant office, and Mr. Eric Holdland had communications with HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5729)|
| 1:35:37| and we made a request to substitute expenditures that the county was already making that would be in line with the directives of the HUD money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5737)|
| 1:35:47| And so what we requested is that we exchange one expense that the county had previously expended for another which was disallowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5747)|
| 1:35:55| and that didn't require a line item transfer other than just to say we want to count money that we spent in another area that was approved separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5755)|
| 1:36:03| I don't know who approved that line item transfer, so what I'm trying to say is this money was dispersed a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| The books have been closed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| Right, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| So how did you transfer something that we voted on a year ago to go one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| and you can go back and do it another way when the books were closed on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| That's exactly what we did is we did not do a transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| What we did is we asked HUD the permission to count money that was already spent in another area instead of that previous grant that was disallowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5787)|
| 1:36:38| All right, now you just said that money was already spent in another area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| It's dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| Where did we get this other $34,000.00 from to give these people National Family of Medicine here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| Where did it come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| Who appropriated that's what I'm trying to say, this other $34,000.00?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| It was approved through the regular budget process as part of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| How was it approved through the budget process when it was already closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| When did you come back and get it approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Through what budget process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| Our budget was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| We've done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Then it's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| I'm happy to provide the commission the documentation that came from our community grants office, the request that was made to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5832)|
| 1:37:21| I'm not interested in HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| They're not satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| They don't care where this money comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| What I'm interested in is where we got another $34,000.00 to disperse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| We're actually dispersing $68,000.00 instead of $34,000.00 that we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| What we counted on, and, no, we did not disperse any additional money at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| What we did do is we asked permission to count other money that the county had already previously spent instead of that $34,000.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5860)|
| 1:37:49| Did you ask any of these county commissioners here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| What we did is we asked HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| Aren't we supposed to approve line item transfers, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| The money was previously approved in the budget and spent according to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| and what we did is we asked permission to count item that might be in line A instead of item that's in line B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| You asked HUD that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| The total spending did not vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| You asked HUD to do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| When we approved it, we approved it to give it to Family Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Yes, and that's what happened, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Well, it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| You gave it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| Okay, now you're wanting to transfer it over to National Academy of Medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| No, we do not want to transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| What we have is we had a separate expenditure to Academy of Medicine that was separately approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5918)|
| 1:38:46| and we did not want to spend any additional money, no additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| What we did want to do is substitute that grant, which falls into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| or within their acceptable spending, and that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| That request was approved, and we didn't change any line items because there was no need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| Well, now, first of all, I don't want anybody here to think that I'm blindsiding you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| I've talked to you about this two or three times and asked for an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| We discussed this, and we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| You have, several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| I'm happy to provide this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| I just still don't understand how this money gets transferred around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| That's why I've come up with this, that any time you have to make a line item transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| that you've got to come before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Yes, and we concur with the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| All right, but I still haven't got an explanation on how you did it, but I'm glad you're concurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| We'll be happy to present that to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Yes, Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| I mean, I understand how you did it, but if HUD disallowed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| what was the disallowment for, and if they disallowed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| would we not have some kind of the same policies that we would have disallowed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| I think I'd like to have Mr. Hoagland to help with that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| He was much more intimately involved with the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Bring him on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| I don't know that he's even here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| That was my only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| If HUD disallows something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| would we not have the same similar policies that would disallow our money going to that program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6028)|
| 1:40:36| We don't have a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| There's nothing to prevent us from having a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Well, I know that we don't have a connection with HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| but a connection if there was some kind of disallowment, would we not be having the same problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6043)|
| 1:40:53| with taxpayer money going to the same place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6053)|
| 1:41:00| I think we need to get Mr. Hoagland to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Mr. Owens, you weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Have you examined this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| And can you tell us your opinion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| John, are we talking about a line item transfer here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| I mean, I hear Commissioner Pinkson's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| And basically we're getting more or less a credit from HUD for these monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6081)|
| 1:41:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| But we didn't actually go through a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| We weren't required to go through a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| That's the way I understand it for that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| The only thing I don't understand is we gave people $34,000 that they were not entitled to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| and that money is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Now, where did this other $34,000 that we're giving to families, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| to National Academy of Medicine come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| Tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| I'm assuming it's tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| That's the way I would think it would come out of the general fund or somewhere would be my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| I think it wasn't the families, wasn't that the kinfolk to Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| So probably the federal government said there was a conflict of giving that money to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| That's why they disallowed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| That's why they disallowed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| So if it's disallowed from them, why would we not disallow giving a family member $34,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| Oh, I'm agreeing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| He posed the question, where did that money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| It could be from a different grant other than HUD or it came from tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6153)|
| 1:42:40| You know, right now the commission already has the authority under our code to require that all line item transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6160)|
| 1:42:48| come before the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| What you're doing, you're basically exercising your intention to have all line item transfers come before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6171)|
| 1:43:00| From what I understand, there are a number of line item transfers that take place within the 100 level category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6180)|
| 1:43:10| I don't know if you fully understand what you're asking for, but it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| And it's going to be a book, I think, just about every time you have a finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| It's a tremendous amount of work for the administration, but so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| You have the authority to do exactly what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| And the reason why I did this, John, is I believe they said they had the right to raise these salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| but moving something around the 1 and 200s there without coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| So I know of no other way to stop these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| And I hate to do that because it's going to put a lot of burden on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| But we have to put some kind of controls in effect right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| I don't know that it will ultimately bring a stop to what it is you're suggesting, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| because what you may have is, from what I understand, office holders basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| instead of detailing what's within the 100 categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| is they're just going to have a set number for each 100 category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| And so you're not going to have line item transfers within 100 categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| It's all going to be in salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| It's all going to be in benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| There are four or five major categories that we must have for our accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| and it may be that it's just not broken down like it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| But right now everything is broken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| If you look at my budget, we have a budget for books and for you name it that goes into the makeup of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6278)|
| 1:44:48| But it may be that I would only consider just expenses, office expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| and books would just be one of those things falling under that major category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| So that may ultimately be the end result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6298)|
| 1:45:04| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Commissioner Pinkston, I understand what you're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| and I applaud the thoughtfulness that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| But I agree with one of the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| or maybe it was Law Director Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| but I can see that being a huge, thick book with tons of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| Maybe there's a dollar limit or a dollar amount that when it reaches that threshold that we see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6327)|
| 1:45:36| But I don't think that we want to see if they have to transfer $5 to cover, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| an amount to make sure they're hitting that budget amount every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| I don't know that we want to have to see every one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| I guarantee you I don't because I have to sign off on every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| But if you can come up with a dollar amount, what I'm trying to stop is these salaries being raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| I think, illegally without us voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| Well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| If you want to come up with an amendment to some kind of dollar amount, now you're a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Put it on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Well, $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Or maybe the law director would go with the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| I'll have to talk to our accounting folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| First of all, I'm not a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Then I'll withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| I'll withdraw this until you can come up with some kind of dollar amount, something that maybe we can put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| Well, the administration needs to come up with a dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| If the administration wishes, you know, I'm sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6392)|
| 1:46:40| I understand he said he would withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| If the administration wishes to come to this podium and make a statement that it desires not to have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6402)|
| 1:46:50| mounds and mounds of work, then they can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| Otherwise, you know, I haven't heard that from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6414)|
| 1:47:02| I just want to make a statement that I think this is a healthy discussion that we have for this new budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| We're going to have plenty of discussion and plenty of hard issues in this new budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| and I think we'll add this to this and it's something that we can work on together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| Okay, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6437)|

| 1:48:19| Well, I'd like to discuss something on it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| I'm going to give a second to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6503)|

| 1:49:04| To give them the money, you didn't vote saying it was legal, but I want the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| I can't vote for yours, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6551)|

| 1:50:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| Hopefully we're on to a little happier subject, saving Rocky Top maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| I did want to say a couple of things about the motion, and then after I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6626)|
| 1:50:32| Ms. Annette Anderson would like to speak to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| She's from the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| Of course, I think it's widely acknowledged the beauty of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| We live in this place the geographers call a ridge and valley ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| It's unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| It's highly valued by our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| and we recognize that our past land use practices have caused our water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6655)|
| 1:51:06| our air, certainly these steep slopes to be in a situation of duress at the very least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6666)|
| 1:51:16| There's all types of issues that are related to the proper development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| or proper preservation and conservation of these steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| Just a few of those are listed in the resolution, public health, safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| We've got issues of landslides, flooding, stormwater issues, groundwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| So what the purpose of the task force is to address these issues in the form of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6695)|
| 1:51:47| well, it's basically a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| The task force job will be to study, evaluate, plan, and make recommendations to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6709)|
| 1:51:58| This resolution is a mirror of the resolution that will go before the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6718)|
| 1:52:05| The members of the committee are listed in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| They've been contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| They've agreed to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| And so we hope that this body will approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| and acknowledge the truth in this and the value to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| and will support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| And, Ms. Anderson, if you'd like to come now and speak, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6746)|
| 1:52:34| I'm Annette Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| I live at 509 West Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| I'm speaking to you this evening as a representative of the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| The league has been studying land use issues for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6764)|
| 1:52:51| We've had a committee that's been working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| We've had three general membership meetings with panels of community activists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| and experts in various aspects of land use planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| We've had a number of discussions, newsletter articles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| and all this background work is what the league always does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| the purpose of which is to be sure that when the league takes a position on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| it is backed up by an informed membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| And last year at our May annual meeting, we adopted a position on land use planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| which included, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| that we support policies that place restrictions on development of ridges, slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6815)|
| 1:53:42| open spaces, and vegetation that have been identified as critical to maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| our community's air and water quality, biodiversity, functioning habitats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| and or historic and scenic character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| We think that this resolution is an appropriate first step to develop the kind of regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6838)|
| 1:54:07| which will meet both the community's and the league's aspiration for a good community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6847)|
| 1:54:17| We think that the task force will be a good mix of community interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| and that they will be able to come up with recommendations which would protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| water quality, preserve important vegetation and open spaces, provide good home sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6866)|
| 1:54:35| and preserve the scenic character of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| I urge your adoption of the resolution and the formation of this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| I thank you for your attention and appreciate your commitment until 11 o'clock at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| to improving our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| Thank you, Ms. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| We appreciate you sticking around so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| For the members of the commission, if you haven't viewed the committee selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| I think it's very representative of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| It has members of the scientific community, members of the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| We've tried to be inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| This is an effort to reach consensus within this community about an issue that's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| and has been widely recognized through surveys by the MPC, et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| that this is an important issue to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Well, you kind of addressed one of the potential issues that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| I agree with the formation of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| But as I look at the committee makeup, are there any minority members on this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6943)|
| 1:55:52| What do we have in the way of minorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| Joe Hawkus is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| He's city councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| He and I are the co-chairs of the committee or the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6960)|
| 1:56:09| I didn't recognize any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| Well, there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| There's a Professor Menendez from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| Black people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| I just encourage you all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| Certainly, Commissioner McKenzie, I appreciate that comment, and I think that's well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| The history on how those names came about is we, Commissioner Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| and I asked the long-range planning staff at MPC for recommendations for names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| so we felt like they could give sort of a balanced recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| And, of course, we reviewed them and there was feedback and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| And we wanted to make sure it was as inclusive and representative as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| but I think that's an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| And we were trying to get something that would mirror in both resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7020)|
| 1:57:07| and we could kind of make it clean and neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| And we wanted to make sure we covered everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| but, you know, if we need to go back and add to the body later, we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| you know, at a separate set of resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| I guess if you're okay with that, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| And in the process of looking at the names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| I never even thought about a racial consideration, but I suspect that would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7049)|
| 1:57:38| In terms of this is a good task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| And if you need a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| I'd be glad to present you with a name or two for you all to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| someone that would add value and strong opinions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| And I would hope that the commission would pass this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| and then hopefully council tomorrow night and then we can address if there, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| and my preference would be in a separate set of resolutions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| to add to fill in the gaps if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| Excuse me for interrupting, Councilman Holzquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| I would echo the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| There are a number of people, for example, in the Ellis Bell community, Bob Wolfenbarger, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| and others who might be good name additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| I don't want to mess with the consensus resolution tonight, but I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| as regarding the minority point, other names, subcommittees, activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| I hope you'll be open to such suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| I was called an extremist earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| and I can certainly see why Mr. Norman would consider me extremist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| Our views are extremely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| And I think that what happens when you get a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| or when you get a body that's going to legislate or make recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| that what you should go for is a very balanced group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| so that we have folks like Mr. Norman when it comes to land use issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| and folks like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| When I look down through this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| I see that it tends to be a bit heavy on folks that tend to agree more with Commissioner Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7157)|
| 1:59:25| and fewer folks that tend to have a similar view as myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| In an attempt to balance this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| I'd like to add the following names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| And, Mr. McKenzie, you had some very valid points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| and so I've added a couple of African-Americans to the list as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| I'd like to add Scott Davis, if he's willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| Again, long-time commissioner, very successful businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| Bruce Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| R. Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Richard Cates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| Mr. McKenzie, I'd like to see you on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| And Chuck Williams in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| He really impressed me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| and I think this would be a good committee for him to be on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| I feel like adding these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| and granted most of the names I've mentioned do tend to be more pro-property rights, pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7214)|
| 2:00:22| I think that it will balance it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| and I think at the end of the day what we need to do is we need to come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| folks who have different viewpoints can come up with some compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7227)|
| 2:00:35| And I do think that we need to preserve air hill to air hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| I think we need to preserve air hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| We need to look at things like allowing clustering of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| so that you develop on the top of hills or at the bottom of hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7245)|
| 2:00:49| and, you know, that you don't just bulldoze the hill down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| But I think that we need some business interest in here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| So I'd like to propose those following names to add to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| Commissioner Lambert, I'm very flattered that you would put my name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| but I'm not looking for anything else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| So I would respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| We'll scratch that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| And if anyone else I've mentioned doesn't want to do this, we can scratch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| I was just trying to balance things out a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| No, and I definitely appreciate that, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| I'd like to enter a substitute, a James Wade, in lieu of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7282)|
| 2:01:27| but I do agree with those names that you called out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| Yeah, something else, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| Yeah, that's a motion to add those names to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| And notice I've not tried to take anybody away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| I just want to bring some others to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| You're offering a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| I'm offering a substitute motion that we pass this with those names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| or at least the ones that I've mentioned that are willing to serve, adding their names to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| And some of them Mr. Smith just turned his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| He may have an opinion here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| Commissioner Lambert, are you going to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| Yes, James Wade also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| We don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| We have a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| Could you re-read the addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Scott Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| And, again, this is pending their willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| Scott Davis, Bruce Williams, myself, R. Larry Smith, Richard Cates, James Wade, and Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7348)|
| 2:02:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Commissioner Norman, what on this committee, how long are you going to run it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| Is something going to be done in six-month periods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| Is it going to be like a three-year thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| What are you guys thinking on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| I really have no timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| We hope to, given that we have contacted all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| and they have agreed to serve that we thought we could meet the first meeting in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| and begin the process, but have no idea how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| That depends on how the topic gets broken up and covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| And when we feel like it's at a satisfactory point to bring it to the commission and to the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| that's when we would bring it back, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| Are you going to meet at daytime or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| When do you all plan to meet and where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| Well, I would assume it would be after hours, and we have not decided where that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| Most likely the group would be broken up into subcommittees and subject areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| and that would be determined at the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7425)|
| 2:03:53| Commissioner Holliman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| This is a carefully crafted list of people who have already been contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| For example, Mr. Chuck Williams, he's already on the mayor's task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| and I don't know if he can pull double duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| He certainly hasn't been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| A great person, but let's not go adding names willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| There are names here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| Doug Berry, Blue Ridge Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| Scott Firth, REMAX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| Victor Jernigan, prominent developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| Tim Zitzman, Graham Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| The development community is well represented on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| There is no need to do this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| and it would create havoc because some of these people may not even want to serve on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| We have a well-crafted list worked out with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| Let's leave it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| Do we have a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| No, I'm sticking with the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| I just wanted to defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| Yes, there are developers and pro-property rights folks on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| I acknowledge that there are folks of that persuasion on this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7497)|
| 2:05:04| but they are greatly outnumbered by folks who tend to have a more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| And, again, I see you shaking your head, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| I know you don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| You think that your viewpoint is the norm and that mine is the extreme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| and I acknowledge that maybe I am extremely pro-property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| Commissioner Lambert, when you stand that far right, everything looks left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| Why don't we work out with what we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| We have a motion on the floor, a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| Roll call, starting at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| Can I just have a reminder again of what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| I just really want a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| Just the adding of the additional names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| Okay, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7558)|

| 2:06:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| Commissioner Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| Wrong bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| I've almost done that about three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7605)|

| 2:06:47| Commissioner Ivan Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7611)|

| 2:06:56| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Nine-ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| Ten noes, nine yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| Motion is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| It fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| We're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| I'd just like to add, you know, I think the grant committee that got put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| there's 57 people or 60 people, whoever wanted to serve on it could serve on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| So, if it's going to stand like that, I'll have to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7649)|
| 2:07:36| Mr. Norman, you're looking like you don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| The grant committee that I think the mayor's office put together, anybody who wanted to participate was welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7659)|
| 2:07:47| They didn't let anybody that wanted to come in to the group could come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| I think that the group would encourage participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| It will be an open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| It will be sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| The committee meetings will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| It will be open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Any of these people that want to participate in the process, other developers will be welcome to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7684)|
| 2:08:12| Now, as far as their voting privileges on the committee or how those decisions will be made, that probably would not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7692)|
| 2:08:20| But I think this, just as Commissioner Harmon said, I think this is a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| This is a task force that represents the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| It has development interests on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| I think we'll be fine at coming to some type of recommendation that this body can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7712)|
| 2:08:39| I think it will be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| Well, right now I'm not sure if the community is representative because we come back to the minority issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7729)|
| 2:08:50| And I think there should be some way to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| Well, that's what we're going to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| We've already said we will address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| But the motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| So it's not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| And do you plan to address that tonight or at what point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Well, what we will do is we will have an amendment to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| and we'll have to add, we've already said to Mr. McKenzie and to Mr. Strickland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| that we will seek minority status input on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| And do you know the makeup, how many is from each district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| We didn't consider district by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| We went on recommendations from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| They gave us a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| That would be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| That we add just James Wade, which I believe is Mr. McKenzie had brought forth his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| Do I have that correct, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we just add Mr. Wade's name to that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7791)|
| 2:09:57| and leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| I'll accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| We'll accept that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| It's been put as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| We then voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| Would you consider it as an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| I'm just trying to add his name to the committee, however we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| I think that would be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| Let's just make it I'll accept it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| Well, just add it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| Then that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| Is that okay with the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7836)|
| 2:10:37| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Oh, you're okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Chairman, I thought we needed to contact these people to ask them if they were willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7841)|
| 2:10:47| I thought that that was one of the reasons that we were approving the original list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| was these were people that had been contacted and said that they were willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| They were going to come back at a later date with other names of people that did represent minorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7856)|
| 2:11:03| and others that had been contacted and said that they were willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7863)|
| 2:11:09| That was my understanding as well, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| And Commissioner Lambert came up with a good list of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| That's what I'm getting at, and I want to make this point very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7876)|
| 2:11:22| Folks who tend to be more liberal in nature say they want to be inclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| yet when I showed them some names that I felt like the offer should be made to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7889)|
| 2:11:38| rather than being inclusive, they chose overwhelmingly not to support the addition of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7898)|
| 2:11:47| And, again, I'm the one that's been called an extremist tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| yet I think my views on property rights tend to represent more what your average Tennessean thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7910)|
| 2:11:59| But I value diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| I think that it is vital when something like this comes forward that it have folks of a diverse background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7921)|
| 2:12:10| And I don't think it's appropriate to add, and I counted five folks that I identified that were probably pro-development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7930)|
| 2:12:19| ten folks that I identified that were probably more environmentalist persuasion, anti-property rights folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7939)|
| 2:12:27| and then the rest of them were folks that I was unsure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| But based on the makeup of the ones that I know, I'm assuming that they probably lean a little more toward folks that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7951)|
| 2:12:38| and I guess Mr. Norman considers his view the normal view and my view the more extremist view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7958)|
| 2:12:45| And, again, I'm not asking for anybody to be removed from this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| I'm asking for you to be inclusive, and I'm asking for you to be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| and add a few more folks to this list so that you will have a richer, more diverse group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7974)|
| 2:13:02| And for the folks that I think that we should re-vote, because I think some folks misunderstood what we were voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7982)|
| 2:13:10| this is to add folks to this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| Commissioner Lambert, I think one thing that I heard Elaine say, too, was if those people haven't been contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=7993)|
| 2:13:20| we don't know if they'd actually be willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| And what I'd rather see is for maybe you to bring forth a list or several people that's been contacted or agreeing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8002)|
| 2:13:34| Instead of putting people's name on there and then we wind up having to take them off because of the fact they can't serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| or they're not willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8019)|
