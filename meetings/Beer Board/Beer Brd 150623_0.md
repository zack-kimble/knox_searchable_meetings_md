| 0:05:56| Same as Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=356)|

| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=358)|

| 0:06:02| Los Mariachis is next on the list, and they have closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| So we won't be hearing from Los Mariachis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=366)|

| 0:06:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| It's a combination retail store and food market that's going to focus mainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| on items that are grown here in Knoxville or in the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| also craft beers that are brewed here in Knoxville or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| And when do you plan to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=436)|

| 0:07:37| It's Meeko's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| I debated about that all afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Meeko's Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| 5210 Shubert Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, health department approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| and the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=476)|

| 0:07:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| And the motion is pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Do you want to tell us something about Meeko's Bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Been in business 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=487)|

| 0:08:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Next is the Red Piano Lounge on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| Andrew Carlin, 4620 Kingston Pike, Suite 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Tell us about the Red Piano Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| We're going to be a cocktail lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| We're going to have a grand piano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| We're going to be offering cocktail music in the happy hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| and we'll be doing some jazz music on the evenings and the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Was there something, another business at that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Most recently it was the well located there, and then prior to that it was 4620.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| That takes care of the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| We now need to go to the addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Bar Marley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Bar Marley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Bar Marley first came to us in November of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| They were extended to April 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| and they got another 30-day extension at the May meeting, and here we are, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=570)|
| 0:09:41| Any word from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| There's been no word from them at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| and they did get the notices in the mail to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| And our options are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Our option is no motion, which we can extend it again, or we can not extend it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=591)|
| 0:10:01| And if we have no motion, it will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| So do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Do we know why they had all those extensions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Was it construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| They have a toxically compromised site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| Site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Yes, and they went to TDAC to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| They're working with TDAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| TDAC told them to get air filters and to check the air quality in the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| and they have not gotten the air filters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| And even if they do, if the air quality isn't up to acceptable levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| they'll have to get the soil remediated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| And the person who purchased that site knew that the site had toxic issues prior to his purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=640)|
| 0:10:49| So I'm going to ask one more time, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| Hearing no motion, this is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| Denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| It's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| It's expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Okay, that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| The next item on our list is the Hilton Garden Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| And they're here for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| They were postponed last month because we had just gotten the information from TABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=673)|
| 0:11:23| and so we ask you to take care of all this at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| So give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Fred Bullard, 216 Paragon Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| Okay, did you contact the Metropolitan Drug Commission to get some assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| We asked that you do that the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| No, ma'am, I didn't know you wanted me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Well, we have some options tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| We can let the TABC fine and suspension, which was 60 days, stand and take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=708)|
| 0:11:59| Has that already happened, the 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| You're in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| No, we start July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| Okay, so that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| July 1 through August 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Okay, so that's one option is to let that penalty carry for the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| We can send them to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| They're basically the two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Well, I mean, that's substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I mean, the 60 days, and I couldn't imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| If that doesn't get attention, then I don't know what would, but that's strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| I didn't mean to, Mr. Papas, to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| I'm not understanding why you wanted me to go to the Metropolitan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Because they can help you with ways to be sure that you don't ever get cited again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| that your people who work there understand really clearly what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| They have an alcohol abuse prevention plan and kit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| Because you have been before this beer board before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| And you submitted two plans that were really, really weak plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| And I know that your intentions are good, and that's well and fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| But the bottom line is this beer board needs to be really sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| that there will not be sale of beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| We've only sold beer to a minor one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| But you've sold alcohol to minors, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| We have, but not in the pantry, just in our four-seat bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Councilman Della Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| I was just curious, what steps have you taken since all this arose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| Well, the first time it happened was when they bought it at the pantry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| took it to the bar, and the bartender opened it thinking it was a guest having a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| See, we don't have people stay with us under 21 unless they're with a parent, a coach, guardian, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| They have to be 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| We're 85% corporate business, and we have some leisure traffic on the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Did someone assume that the person was old enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Well, I guess they brought the beer up to the bartender and just set it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| She just thought it was a guest trying to get a beer opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| I believe it was not a domestic beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| So that's what happened with the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| And we straightened that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| We just don't allow if beer is bought in the pantry, it is handled at the front desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| it is not allowed to go to the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| So there's no misunderstanding between the front desk and the bartender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| What was the second time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| The second time for beer was none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Yeah, but you had an alcohol issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| It was carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Just didn't read it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Just subtracted on it, like this girl did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| I mean, we've done everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| We've re-put people through the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| We reinforce it daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I go by the bar every day when I go out and reaffirm what our policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Give them the cutoff date that they can't sell beyond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| It's on the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| It's on the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| It's on the bar POS machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| I don't know what more I can do from a management point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| We think we have good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| We think we have responsible people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| We probably card two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| I send a person in every six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| We may card two more people in the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| We just don't have underage people come in unless there's a sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| And they did what they were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| They asked for their ID, and she misinterpreted the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| That's what she told me, and I'm going to trust her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| She's been with us seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| She's a great employee, very valuable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| And this time I chose not to fire the girl because she was honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| She just made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| So I think we've done what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| We do what we need to do 99.9% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Shoot for 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| I mean, 60 days, I mean, if that's what you want to give to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| I'm going to accept it because we were wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| We didn't give you 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| The ABC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| I know the ABC did, but you follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| We could add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| We could add to that, but we don't know that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| I mean, all I'm asking for is that we do what we're supposed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| and legally what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| We just had two hourly employees make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Okay, and we're glad that you didn't fire them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| because this fear board generally frowns at employees who are fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| I didn't want to fire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| They'll go someplace else and get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| I don't like firing anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| And to be honest, we fired maybe one person in the last 12, 15 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| We have good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| We're a good running operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| And like I said, we just don't have people under 21 in our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| Unless we know it, like Oklahoma's rowing team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| We know they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| We know where they are, and everybody's on heightened alert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| So I need to know the will of the fear board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Do you want to take no further action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| I move we take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Oh, is that an old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| I mean, does that need to be voted on or just accept the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| So we will accept your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| And I know that you're retiring, so let's don't get in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| I hope to retire maybe sooner after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| This has brought this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| The first time you came, you didn't have a gray hair on your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Anyway, we will anticipate not seeing you again and hoping you enjoy your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| I promise you, you won't see me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| I appreciate your leniency and your understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Before you all fold up, do we have any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Well, I guess we'll go back to the example of the one that was presented tonight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| started in March of 2014 and ended up in June of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1093)|
| 0:18:21| So over a year, we've been messing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| And I'm still in pursuit of some type of policy or some type of provision that we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| that doesn't make this subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| It gets to a certain age, it's automatic out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| And I don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| I've thrown out some suggestions and I'd like to hear what you suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| and maybe we can find something where it's not quite so subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Anybody else have any thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| I do have a thought or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Just coincidentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| This is very annoying and this has happened over the whatever many years I've been on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| beer board and that we do have some people who seem to go on forever and they never get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| finished and ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| So that does become annoying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| We also have some businesses that have quite a few establishments in town and they like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| apply several months before they're actually going to open and sell to be sure that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| get a beer permit at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| So we have to balance their needs because they are a good they provide a lot of tax money to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| Let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| And also the people maybe who didn't have the resources to finish what they started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| So with that in mind, what I would like to suggest if the beer board is interested in having some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| kind of a rule or policy is that 90 days from the first hearing that a business comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| that if they're not up and running and they need extensions for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1197)|
| 0:20:05| they need to bring us some documentation showing that they are making forward progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| In the case of a business that's been longstanding, this would not be a hardship for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| show us their permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| If you buy a piece of property and you get into it and find out suddenly that there's toxic soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| or there's some other issue that you need to remediate, then you would have something to show us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| that you were making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| It just wasn't as fast as you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| I think when most people apply for a permit, they expect to be up and selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| and making money very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| And that isn't always the case with some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| And we've had different ones at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| So I need to take a gauge or the temperature of the beer board in looking at 90 days from the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| of your first hearing if you need extensions to come back and show us why you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| Councilman Grieve, I know you have a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| What does a permit cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Plus some other expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| It seems to me that while we're thinking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| and I guess we're not going to try to vote on it tonight necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| but it could be that you have at the end of 90 days, if you want an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| you pay another $100 or $200 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I mean, and of course that depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| The problem is there's extenuating circumstances in each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| So maybe don't tie money to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| But these ones that go on for a year, year and a half, I mean, the $250 goes away pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| We can spend more than that on advertising in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| Do you have a comment about that, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| I'd have to research that about adding an extra fee on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| State law caps the application fee at $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| I don't know if that would encompass whether if you needed extra time you'd have to pay another $100 or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| So off the top of my head, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I just couldn't agree with the tacking on more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| I don't think that that does anything to eliminate the problem, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Then you've got small business owners who are trying to get their businesses open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| and we're putting a tax on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| I mean, that's a tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Let's face it, at the end of the day, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| And when you're in that phase of opening any business, but particularly a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| as expensive as it is to open one, then I couldn't support tacking more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| And, again, I don't think it gets to the root of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| I understand where Councilman Wallace is coming from, but so many of these cases are unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| I mean, I don't know how we can, if we do this, we're going to put ourselves in a box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| and I'll guarantee you down the line we're going to regret getting in that box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| because somebody's going to come with a valid reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| and then all of a sudden we've got our hands tied as to what we can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| So, you know, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| I mean, I would go along with the documentation as long as we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| and I would assume you would work with Mr. Frost and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| to exactly what that documentation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| I think that's fair and it doesn't put any more burden on a small business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| trying to get their business open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| So my two cents on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Mr. Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I mean, I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I mean, I think we've shown by the requirement that they have to have the TABC class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| and fingerprinting how we put ourselves in a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| And as a result of that policy that we adopted that, you know, I'm against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| we've had to have special called meetings, sort of for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| I don't know what it really achieves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| You know, and I guess my question is what is the problem we're trying to solve here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Is there a cost to the city of having people on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| Yes, they need to be notified by certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| And it also has to be published again in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| No, no public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Okay, just they need to be notified by certified mail each time that they're on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| So for 12 certified letters, how much is that annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| I mean, it's just a very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Six dollars a pop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| So 12 would be 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| And that's cutting, you know, to the 250 that they've paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Right, so I guess that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| But I think this board has very little discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| I think this is one where typically in my experience on the beer board has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| that the owner is contacting us and at least making some effort, showing up, explaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| be it either showing up or email that they're working on it, we extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| And when they sort of drop off, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Sometimes we give them one strike and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| To me that seems to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| We have discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| We know what's going on and we have the history of each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| So why put ourselves in a box when we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| the nine of us can decide if one's been around too long and needs to be dismissed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| That's my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| I think part of my objection was in this particular case from March 14 to June 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1540)|
| 0:25:49| there is some chance that he's had a change in his arrest record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| And over an extended period of time, you know, that was part of my objection was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| you don't know what's happening to him without doing a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| I talked to Mr. Frost about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| It gets complicated with the KPD and doing an updated background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| But my pick of date, maybe it's six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| But when it's an extended period of time, we redo the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| I also would offer conjecture that there is a direct, I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| I haven't done the math, but it's just purely my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| But I've got to believe that there's a path here of people that can't get their stuff turned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| to the same person that's back here on a short time basis with underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| There is a direct correlation of people that can get their work turned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| on time and get their work done to being a responsible business person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| If you're going to be a responsible business person selling alcoholic beverages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| it's reasonable to expect that you get it done in a reasonable period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and that you answer emails and you show up at meetings like you're responsible to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| I'm all about giving them the money, but there's a sense of responsibility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Is it costing the city money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Maybe not, but we are here to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| but I'm not here to waste my time month after meeting after meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| on people that can't even show up and answer emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| And it takes time, and Frost gets after us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| He said, well, you have to have some type of reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| You can't just say, I don't like this guy or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| You have to have a reasonable reason, and that's the box you're put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| is because you have to be able to defend it and be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| And I hear that loud and clear, and that's just something we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| I don't necessarily have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| My answer would be to make them update their background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| after a certain period of time, and whether that's six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| But from March 14 to June 15, a lot could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| But that was the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| I think the other thing to talk about is the possibility of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| Can we increase our fines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I just heard him say you can't increase the application fee, and that's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| But sometimes these fines are so small that it's a lot easier for them to pay a small fine and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1697)|
| 0:28:25| That's a pretty big fine, knocking them out of service for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| And $1,500 for two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| So I don't know if that's something we can talk about or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| but I'm trying to put it where it's punitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| if they're going to be especially back here past the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| especially within a certain period of time of getting approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| So that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| All right, Mr. Frost, I think you have some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Following up on Beer Board Member Wallace's first comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| yes, it is possible to have someone go through a background check again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| I talked about it with Sergeant Hunter beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| We'd have to change the way of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Presently, if someone is totally approved, that's the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| If they're approved pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| if the Beer Board is going to decide after X period of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| they need to come back in and go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| the motion would have to then become pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| and any subsequent necessary background checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| and then Ms. Day or Ms. Dyer would have to keep a track of that time approaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| and then people would have to come back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| And Sergeant Hunter can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| but it's actually the TBI that does the check, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| We're actually in the process of changing our background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Currently, one of the officers in the unit does a local background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| but once we get that set up with TBI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| they'll actually do a comprehensive background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| where we will take a fee and schedule an appointment for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| to go to a contract location for TBI to do the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| But, I mean, for the applicant, there will be an additional cost to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| because the way I understand it, when they come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| it's basically a snapshot in time that that background check is good for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| and if they want to do it for another date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| they're going to need to come and do the paperwork again and pay the fee again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| But, you know, whatever is the will of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| So you put the onus on them to do the update, both fee and time involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Well, yes, but it would fall on those ladies over there, in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| to calendar and tell someone, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| you're going to be up on the next beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| because you haven't gotten your final documentation in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| and you would also need to go and do your background check again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| And they'd have to go, if they did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| they'd have to go back in and be re-fingerprinted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Yes, the process we're going to will mirror what we do with the vehicles for hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| where we take the fee, we schedule an appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| we go to a contract location, which typically it's a UPS store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| and they do the electronic fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| And part of the reason is because TBI is not going to be taking the ink fingerprint submission cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| But they'd have to go back in, in this case, to update your background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| you'd have to go back in and be re-fingerprinted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Yes, and that also goes for everybody who files another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| like an annual special events application, they'll have to go every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| They'll just come to my office, we'll schedule an appointment with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| we'll set that up for them, and then they would follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Okay, Councilman Brown, we've not heard you weigh in on any of this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| Are you thinking about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Yes, I'm thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I'm listening to Councilman Wallace's thoughts on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| and I can understand it, but, of course, one size doesn't fit all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| and we have to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| And if we adopt a policy, I guess we could also undo it, which would be unfair to certain businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| So I would think, are you planning to have a vote on it tonight, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Okay, well, that's good, because I need to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| Because this is something that has, every time we have one of these cases that's extended for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| this comes up, and Councilman Wallace has been very vocal about his concern that people have fingerprints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| I mean have violations after they've been through the process and they're waiting for final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| I wish that there was a way, and I don't know if there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| that we could check and see how many times somebody has been approved pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| and it turned out that they had, in fact, would have not been approved if they had committed a crime of some sort that causes them to not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1984)|
| 0:33:14| I don't know if there's a way that we can go back and look at that or find out, is this really a big problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| Is this a problem at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Has it ever happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Has it happened once in 40 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| We'll think about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I just think if we clearly mark the application, if you don't get your act together, all your documentation within six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| you must repeat that at your expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Just lay it out in bold print on the application, and they should know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| and hopefully we'll find a way to calendar that so that it kicks up in our files, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| But let's put it right on the application in all caps and bold ink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| I mean, the point he makes is a legitimate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| We shouldn't be giving licenses to people who aren't qualified, and if they delay it and then something happens, we should know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2039)|
| 0:34:08| Let me jump back in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| The state legislature has set what the qualifications are, and if you meet those qualifications, it's a you shall be granted the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2049)|
| 0:34:19| A lot of discretion has been taken away from local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| No criminal background is part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| We're just saying if it's older than six months, how do we rely on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| Put the onus on the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I understand what you're saying, but you also said, you know, looking at their qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| implying there was an extra qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| On every single peer board application that comes before us, we ask Ms. Hunter if there's been a background check and if there's any violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| We're going to ask it again in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Councilman Saunders, we haven't heard from you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| I'm looking at the two councilmen across from me, Mr. Wallace and Mr. Pavlis, because they both have legitimate concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| and I think we are all concerned, especially with the small businesses trying to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| I mean, there is some real onus and some expense there that I know we would like to minimize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| and I know we're all sensitive to, so I'm glad we're not going to vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| I am quite willing to look at something some time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| and I'm more comfortable with the six months that was just mentioned than I am with the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| And perhaps some documentation or some statement on the application that says very clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| if you don't get this done in X time, whatever that is, you're going to have to start the process again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| because certainly things can happen in that interim period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| So it's not just a black and white issue, at least in my mind it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Yes, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Just for clarity, you said start the whole process over again or just the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| Well, I'm more concerned about the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Well, you said the whole process, so I just want to make sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| So if I hear correctly, I'm on hot coals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| You know, back to the one comment that was just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| I wonder what the instance of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| I mean, we see it periodically, and this Barr-Marley is maybe the instance that's pulled that trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| And so it's the exception that stands out, but I don't know what the rule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| Well, and the person who applied through Barr-Marley has not had any violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| that would kick out his background check or his record or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| and he did complete the task class right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| So even though he couldn't get his site accepted by TDEC and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2199)|
| 0:36:50| he still had not really committed any violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| We were just simply waiting for him to get that inspection completed so we could issue the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| but he did not violate any laws that we know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| You're not familiar with these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| I'm not aware of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| I think the discussion has been good, but I think one of the things I'd like to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| which goes in line with what Mr. Saunders says, is, you know, how many of these do we actually have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| I mean, out of all the beer permits that we've had in the last, say, even year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| or the six years I've been on city council, I know it's irritating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| I know it's questionable when somebody can't do what they're supposed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| in terms of turning in the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| but it may be the kind of thing that we're kind of just scratching at something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| that may not be that big of a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| but it's a problem because something like this comes up once or at several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| So I think I'd be interested to know in terms of how many beer permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| how many have been delayed and this sort of thing to help make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| So you're suggesting that we could be offering a solution in search of a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| One of my colleagues to either my left or right made that comment to me that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| are we looking for a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| We do that sometimes on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| I actually had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| If someone has a permit and then they commit a crime, what happens and how do we track that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| When we find out, we submit documentation to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| They'll file a noncompliance complaint, and then there's a hearing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| So is there a way to apply that process to people that have been approved pending, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| Could we put them in that hopper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| Well, they would still have to have a background check again, wouldn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| I'd have to check with the law department because in the current process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| that only occurs after a permit has actually been issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| and if they're approved pending final documentation, I don't know where that would put us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| If they're going to be on the agenda again, if the board adopts a policy that when they come up for an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2333)|
| 0:39:03| and they're on the agenda, we could just do another background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| That would be fine, but like I was saying before, once we change to the new background check policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| the current cost is $38 each background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| So we do a background check on every permit holder in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| Every applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Every applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| But I mean for current permit holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Then if they commit a crime, how does that process get triggered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| I guess that's what I'm having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| There's an ordinance that city courts are supposed to report those violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| I can't remember if it's to KPD or the law department, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| But do we have a good way, or is it possible that somebody has committed a crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| that would prevent them from getting a permit, even if they have a permit, then we still wouldn't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| To my knowledge, there's nothing in state law that would require state courts to notify us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| if they've been convicted of an applicable violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| There is a city ordinance, as Mr. Frost said, that requires city court to notify either the board or the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| if there's a city court violation that would cause a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| But most of the violations that cause a problem are mostly state crimes, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Most of the issues we've seen, including one of the ones that was on the agenda for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| it was a conviction in city court that would have prevented him from getting the beer permit tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Well, I guess my point is they could get the permit, commit a crime, a state crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| There's not a background check done every six months on the people that have permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Again, I think the sentiment is correct that we don't want people to get permits that shouldn't get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2447)|
| 0:40:56| but people that there's, I don't know, hundreds of permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| I don't know how many beer permits are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| We're not doing a background check on every person that's got one every six months that they get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| Well, there are also a very limited number of crimes that you can commit that would prevent your getting a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2471)|
| 0:41:20| And so people could do things that don't fall within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| We would not know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| If they sell to minors, those kinds of things, then we could take action then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2485)|
| 0:41:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Everybody thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Unsatisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| We still have 19 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Councilman Wallace, if you want to go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| I was hoping you'd have something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Well, seeing no further business before us, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150623?start=2512)|
