| 0:00:00| Fort Sedgley Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| I'm a retired professional engineer with 45 years' experience in engineering, planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3)|
| 0:00:13| and economic development, most of it across the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=13)|
| 0:00:19| I see this ordinance as a problem in three areas, economics, engineering, and political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=19)|
| 0:00:32| First of all, in economics, it's a financial problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| We hear an awful lot about over-regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:39| This is a perfect example of over-regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=39)|
| 0:00:43| It's something that it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=43)|
| 0:00:49| It's going to cost to administer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=49)|
| 0:00:52| It's already a lot of money has been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| I have no axe to grind with the issue because it's not going to help or hurt me, but it's except personal taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:08| Tax base, any time that you take as much property that has to be taken out of the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:18| including the hillsides, the flood plains, and so forth, you have nothing left to tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| Housing costs, any time you reduce the acreage, your housing costs are going to go way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:32| Any time the utility costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| When I moved to Knoxville ten years ago, retired here, I looked at the number of vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=95)|
| 0:01:44| And I said, hi, in the world are they handling the utilities to pass these vacant properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| because it's very expensive to pass property that's undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=110)|
| 0:01:58| A community cannot stand still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| It's got to either grow or it's going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| And this area of Tennessee, I've looked at all over the south, and it's not competitive as far as resources in competing for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=126)|
| 0:02:19| The second thing is engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| Each development is a special case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| Slopes can be mitigated by benches, retaining walls, ground cover, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| Slope engineering requires study of soil friction and angle of repose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| I don't think this type of thing was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Drainage is more important than slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| Good design is not up and down the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| It follows the contours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| It works around the drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| The last thing is political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| You should always consider function over facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| This is a facade thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| I don't know how all this got started, but I heard that it was a water tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| Well, a water tank is there for a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| What looks good is in the eyes of the beholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| Let me give you some examples that would not be able to be developed under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| Getty's View, one of our more expensive developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| I feel sure Getty's View would not be able to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| All the land along the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| The area by the Cherokee Country Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| And if you look internationally up and down the Mediterranean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| all the beautiful cities and so forth along the Mediterranean that you see the hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| Sir, you have about a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Those would not be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| I am totally opposed to this, although I have no axe to grind in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Next we have Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Mr. McAdams, would you give us your address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| My name is Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| I'm here today on behalf of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| We do think the plan that's before you is an improvement over what was before you several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| And we appreciate the effort that went into improving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| We do think that it could be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| We do think 15 percent is too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| We think there are problems with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| But the chamber doesn't want to oppose the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| The chamber has always been in favor of adopting an appropriate plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| And we do need to bring this to a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| And having said that, the chamber is not here to oppose this plan if it can be clarified exactly what the legal meaning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:18| What you've been told all along is that this is advisory, that it's just a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| And comments from commissioners and comments from plan proponents and comments from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| and Mr. Donaldson's written remarks on some of the revisions saying this will reinforce that the plan is advisory in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=331)|
| 0:05:39| The plan doesn't say that anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| And that's what this amendment does that Dr. Briggs has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| It makes it clear that the plan is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| I would note for the record there is one typo in that proposal, and that is the reference to the TCA section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| It refers to 13-3-303, and that should be amended to be 304, which is the section that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=355)|
| 0:06:04| The problem is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| State law says that an amendment to the general plan is binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| It says it has to be followed by you in future land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| If you make it a part of the plan, you take away your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| You must follow it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| That's why so often you see on a rezoning or some other action an amendment of the sector plan coming before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| You have to amend it first because you have to follow it unless you amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| So every time a hillside matter came before you, if this plan is binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| then you must follow it unless you go back and amend the hillside plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| which would be a nightmare time after time to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| So you've been told it's advisory, yet state law says it's binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| and says you must follow it if it's an amendment to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| Your resolution that's before you today says adopt this as an amendment to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| The revised plan that's before you says this is an amendment to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Everything that you hear is it's an amendment to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| And state law says amendments to the plan are binding unless you designate those portions of the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| that are not intended to be binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| And that's what this document does, the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| It says we're going to adopt it as an amendment to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| but these sections are not intended to be binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| They're advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| They're going to guide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| They're going to guide the MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| A property owner knows what they're up against when they come before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| if they're trying to do something that's different from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| But ultimately, they can appeal or, on a zoning matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| come directly to you and explain to you why they should do something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| and you have the authority, you have the discretion to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| If you adopt this plan as a binding part of the general plan, then your hands are tied in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=478)|
| 0:08:06| So to do what everyone has always said all along, to make it advisory, to make it a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| to make it guidance, then you need to adopt Dr. Briggs' amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| If you want to make it clear to the people, clear to the citizens, clear to the property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| is it binding or is it not binding, then you need to vote for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| The plan itself doesn't say, I'm a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| It's not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| There are lawsuits waiting to be had if you adopt this in this form without making it clear is it binding or is it not binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=513)|
| 0:08:42| You have about a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| And if it was intended to be binding, say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| We would oppose it if it's intended to be binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| If it's intended to be advisory, say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| Having said that, we would urge you to come together and approve a plan, even though we would recommend changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| Go ahead and approve it if it's advisory and let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| But please vote for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Please make it clear that it's advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Please reserve your discretion to handle these matters when they come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Our next is Mike Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| Mike, if you could give us your address, please, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| I'm in one of those situations where in order not to be redundant, I want to thank you all for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:42| I would urge you, I can't because of what Mr. McAdams said was exactly what I was going to say and I can't add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| Actually, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| When we understood it to be binding, we couldn't understand how any development would occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=593)|
| 0:10:04| that was not going to be extremely complicated from your all standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| If you were to now take it back as it is and you were to amend a sector plan, you amend a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:18| You basically are amending a map and a point in the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| You look at this, the amendment to the hillside slope protection, it's multiple pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| And what in that would you amend in order to then grant what had previously not been recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:43| Or if the homeowners or the property owners surrounding there are not in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| how would you make that amendment for that purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| You have got to maintain control over the ability to hear the appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=655)|
| 0:11:07| You can't abdicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| It's awfully important that however MPC comes to you, that people have the right to bring it to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| and argue their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| It has worked that way for way too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| People can get upset by the way you rule, but it's the way it's worked and it's worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| You can still amend a sector plan because you've got a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| I have no way and we've looked at it way too much to know how you would amend a general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:44| that is written in this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| If you adopt it with Dr. Briggs' language, it's cured in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| You will still be able to hear the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| You are adopting a plan that has very rigorous slope protection as an advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:08| You're taking it seriously, but you can still hear an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| And I've still got 25 seconds and I yield, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Next is Andy Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| Your address for the record, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| I'm D.H. Andy Andrew, 712 Summit Lake Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| I come downtown today on an issue of governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| We need to recognize and remember that our forefathers established for us a constitutional republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:50| We are still a constitutional republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Our forefathers established government to protect our rights, our unalienable creator-endowed rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=774)|
| 0:13:04| Salient among this is the issue of the right of sovereign citizens to private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:19| Today, you are called upon to either defend these rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| or endorse a plan put forth by those who would seek to irrigate to themselves authority to tell property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| how their property should look and or be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| I encourage you to follow a suggestion that was made earlier in this session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:49| to err on the side of defending your constituents' rights to property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| Recognize it's axiomatic, when any right of anyone is abridged, all rights of everyone are weakened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:07| Yes, folks, I strongly encourage you to completely reject this plan in defense of your constituents'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:15| constitutionally protected right to property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Next, we have Mr. Kent Brelsford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Kent Brelsford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| He is not here, so we'll move to Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| If you would give us your address, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| My name is Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| I'm the executive director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| Our office is located on 625 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| I would like to ask the commission to please pass the plan as originally written without the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Our next person is Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| If you would give us your address for the record, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| I'm Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| I live at 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| I'm here representing the Council of West Knox County Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| I'm the president of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| I've been here before you a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| I've been before you in P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Our organization has voted any number of times and supports this plan as written without the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:28| although we respect Dr. Briggs greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| We feel that this has been discussed at great length with a lot of people who have done a great deal of study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| and that the intent of this plan is to protect the property rights of the people who live down hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| and downstream of properties that would be developed in such a way that would damage their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:56| So I thank you very much for allowing us to be part of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| and again would ask you to pass this plan without the amendment that was presented today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| And if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, and I am president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| And I would like to encourage you to pass this plan as it was written previously without the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| I'm a property owner, and I feel like this plan will only increase everybody's property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| A more attractive community creates a more desirable place to live and greater demand for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| People talk about the fact that property owners have rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| and you can't tell them what to do with their land, but we have many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| many zoning ordinances that tell people how they can use their land and how they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:07| I can't buy a piece of property and build a house as big as I want it or as tall as I want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| or as close to my neighbors as I want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| That's just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| So this, as far as I'm concerned, this just falls in the same category of a zoning ordinance of which we already have many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Next, we have Scott Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| Scott, if you could give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| We're Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| I appreciate all the time, energy, and effort that you all put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| And it's consumed a lot of these folks' time as well, people that should be out trying to work to create financial resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:58| for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| And as you all are very, very, very well aware, the building and housing industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| and the development industry has been decimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| It has been completely destroyed and decimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| Part of the reason it has been so decimated is because of what the engineer spoke of earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| We hear about overregulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Between the federal, state, and local level, there are over 50,000 pages of regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| that we already have to adhere to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| This book is 1,000 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| Take this, multiply it by 50, and it would be 12 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| That's what we already have to deal with presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| And all you all want to do is come in and add more regulations to an already struggling industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| It doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| It is 100% political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| There's no other reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Dr. Briggs, I appreciate your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| If, in fact, you all do decide to move forward with this, if you don't approve the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| you're being dishonest to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| MPC put out a memo a while back dated January 31, 2011, in response to some of our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| What is the basic intent of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| Your plan recommends guidelines and policies for development on steeper slopes and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:30| That came straight from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| That came straight in response to questions that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| It has been presented all along as a plan and a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| If, in fact, you all decide otherwise and do not adopt this amendment, you all have lied to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| you've lied to me, and you've lied to the folks here before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| And we're tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| We're tired of being lied to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| We're tired of being manipulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| And we're tired of the over-regulation and the burdens that you put on our industry when we're out there risking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| our life savings to generate jobs, new tax revenue for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| And all you all want to do is kick us in the teeth while we're down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| If, if you have to approve the plan, and if you do not adopt the amendment, you have lied to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Our next, the next person who signed up is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| If you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| My name is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| I live at 6233 Babeley Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| I know you all have heard all of the arguments, and I'm not going to make any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| But I would ask you to adopt this plan as it was written and without the insertion of additional amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| We have talked about this for a very long time, and I know you all are tired of dealing with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| as are many others who are both in support and in opposition of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| The only thing that I would say is it's very unfortunate that people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| whose livelihood it is to develop property would be in ignorance, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:24| of basic ways that zoning and other things, plans, are addressed in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| You know, the very basic thing that you should know is that a plan is advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| that it goes to the MPC, which is a non-legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| and then it always goes before the legislative body, you know, if there's an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| So I would urge you to adopt the plan without the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| It's clearly a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| It's an advisory plan, and it's always been an advisory plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| We had the only other person signed up was Kent Brailsford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Did he come back in, or I want to make sure he has an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| If not, we're going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| I don't see him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Those were the only people we had to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| So, commissioners, any commission comments on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:31| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| Yeah, you know, I've had some real heartache with this from last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:44| We sat through three or four meetings that we had a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| And I got the impression that the facilitator thought that there was a problem between council and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| And during those facilitated meetings, we never addressed the things that we objected to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| the reason this vote lost two or three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| You know, we never addressed 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| We never addressed it being advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| We changed some musts and shalls to maybes and proposals and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| But this coming back before us so quickly reminds me, I wonder what the kickback would be if we brought Midway up two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| months after it was voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| This is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| We sat through a process, and they brought a mediator in, and we had some great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| But we never addressed the real issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| And that's the reason I voted against it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| I think 15% is too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| I think it infringes upon the value of somebody's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| If somebody's got their land, if they've got 100 acres or 50 acres collateraled at a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| and we tell them that the bank told them it's $100,000 and we cut their ability to develop that land in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| then the bank comes back to them six months later after a reassessment and says, you know what, it's only worth 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| And to keep your collateral, to keep your home, whatever you've leveraged, to keep it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| you've got to come up with $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| There's a great potential for that, especially out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| And so I think as we look, you know, I'll be supporting the amendment, but I don't want to pass the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| And I think that we need to address the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| You know, the people, the reason that most people voted it down was the 15% and was the ability for no appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:47| And then another issue that I have, and I really didn't want to touch on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| but, you know, we were told at the last mediated meeting that there was a notice sent out for this tonight, for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1493)|
| 0:25:05| Well, there was no document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| A notice was sent to the public, advertisement was sent to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| saying that we're going to vote on a, I guess, potentially going to vote on a sector plan amendment or on a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:20| We didn't have that document until last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| So how can you give a 30-day notice to the public on a document that hasn't been finalized until last Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| If we talk about process and we talk about doing the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| there's so much that has been said and it's the both sides have gotten emotional about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:43| and it's unfortunate, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| But, you know, there's so much that hasn't happened in regards to why we voted it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| and then why that we should vote it back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| And so, you know, in my opinion, if you address the 15% grade rule and you allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| I would love for it to be advisory to the point where each plat or each subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| or each proposal is done on an individual basis based on recommendations from a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| not a blanket over 35% of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| I think that's a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:27| And I know the vote was close and I know I may not matter, but until those issues are figured out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| I'm not going to vote in favor of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| I'll vote in favor of the amendment, but I will not vote in favor of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| One of the things that we need to keep reminding ourselves of that this is a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| a guideline for which all the ordinances to address each of these issues that some of us may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| or may not have with it have yet to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| Now, whether that's 15% slow or whether it winds up being 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| that's one of the things that you can do when you do the ordinances for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| What we're looking at right now is to get a plan, a guideline in force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| a framework from that we can start building ordinances on each of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| I think that with the amendment that gives us a process to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| Without it, you have no real recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| As far as our vote, when we turned it down the last time it was here, we didn't have any choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| We could not alter it one jot or one tittle that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| It was either yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| We did not have the opportunity to make any adjustments or anything to that plan that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| It was up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| So that's why it went down and we started these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| So I think we've come a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| I think we're at a point right now with this amendment where everybody can live with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| and we can work from it and build on it because, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| these ordinances will take care of a lot of these little things that we have a pain with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| Commissioner Burrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I did want to say that a lot of these issues, as Commissioner Brown just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| we did address these issues with the facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| And I'm sorry that not everyone was able to be at the meetings because they were very helpful, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| for the members of both legislative bodies and also for the members of the public who were able to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| So these issues, they were addressed with the facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| I do feel like I have some questions in terms of Dr. Briggs' amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1731)|
| 0:29:00| My understanding is that all of these plans that we adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| it's a given with these plans whether they're a sector plan or a plan like this is that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| It's a given that they are advisory in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| So I would like to ask Joe if he could give an opinion on what exactly this amendment adds to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:26| or does it add anything or is it basically just reiterating what we already know about how NPC plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| operate and what the appeal process is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| I think the dilemma you have is although as the plan has been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| and as you've discussed it as an advisory regulatory document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| the problem you have is there's a distinction between your intent, whatever that intent may be, binding or non-binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| but under the operation of law, once you adopt the plan, the Tennessee Code essentially says it is now the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| So that's, I think, where you're seeing the conflict between those who oppose the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| and those who are proponents of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| And that's one of the problems we have when people say we're not put on proper notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| or we don't know what our redress is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| If you say to people, it's our intent that it's advisory only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| but you adopt it, now basically you have to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| So then it kind of nullifies the argument that it's advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Now, built into any land use decision, there are two types of appellate processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| regardless if you adopt this plan or how you adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| If someone, for instance, is proposing a development plan, they're going to go before the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| If they get an undesirable ruling, they apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| If they don't like that ruling, they then appeal to chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| If you're talking about a plan amendment or a change in zoning, that's a direct appeal to you as the body politic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| And if they're still unsatisfied, to the chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| So regardless of what language you put into your plan, there's still redress for the landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| But, again, the fundamental issue is this is your plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| The reason you voted up or down last time is because it wasn't your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| You were given a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| You had no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| You couldn't amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| This you can amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| And you can continue to amend as you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| But you have to get to the fundamental issue, what is our goal here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Do we want to provide merely a set of guidelines that provide the landowner with some guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| that she or he can then ultimately reject and ignore, or do you want something with greater enforceability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| And that's the dilemma, and that's the policy decision you have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I guess I'll continue with that, Mr. Jarrett, here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:10| It's raining again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| I guess that's where I'd like to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Because fundamentally it does boil down to water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| Water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| It is amazing how convoluted this thing has gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Essentially now we're down to, you know, the document and the argument around the document that some 70-something pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| 80 pages, now we're down to one paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| And Dr. Briggs characterized it, well, could it be a Trojan horse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Those of us that are on this side think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| And, of course, the reason why we think it is is because it, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| as you try to parallel your plan with code, now what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:12| So basically that's what you're going to, I'm going to ask Mr. Donaldson just in a minute to comment both on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:22| here we've got one side saying, well, there's no appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Well, there is an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| There is an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Mr. Jarrett just explained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| We have appeals to BZA just like we always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| We have appeals to the legislative body just like we always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| So that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Now, we finished the facilitated process of several months and we walked away from our last meeting with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:59| And, by the way, there were several of us that didn't attend these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| and a few of us that hardly attended at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| And they're making comments on this process and I think that's invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:19| City council walked away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| We were in agreement with the document and the amended version that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:32| We had three or four weeks into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| We talked about appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| We all agreed, yeah, the appeal process is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| It's still there just like it always has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| And so we went by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| Well, here it comes back around again because they're associating it with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| Now, water knows no boundaries between the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:04| We need to be in parallel with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| What are they going to do now that we amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Dr. Briggs comes in with an amendment on Monday and then comes in and amends his amendment today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:20| I'm a bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| We need to stay with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| The amended version that went through the facilitated process we all agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| The appeals process can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| This is what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| We can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| This is the way we should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| This is muddying the water metaphorically and practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| And absolutely we're going to get what we've always had if we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:58| I just spent four or five hours in meetings about what road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| Our poster children for the county now hillside wise is Callahan Road and Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:13| You ought to listen to our interagency meetings where all of our professionals are trying to determine what to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:23| that debacle at Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| And we've tiffed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| They still can't decide what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| They cannot figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| It is a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| And we pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| And we have people that have mentioned the economics of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| My time is running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Can I continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| I've got a couple other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Yes, I gave Commissioner Briggs some leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| So regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| A mention of over regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| So let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| So let's not do this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| So that would mean we had let's go back to that old set of regulations that allow Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| That was nothing but a gang rape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| And I'm going to find out who's responsible for it before I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| I can't lay blame on it yet, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| It's an abomination to this county and to the people of Knox County for us to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| and allow land development that has been going on like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| No more borrow pits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| No more stripping hillsides to make strip malls in wetland areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| That's our favorite little double talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:53| Well, our first item to discuss is this appeals process and what Dr. Briggs had to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2273)|
| 0:38:03| And I would like for Mr. Donaldson to opine, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:14| We have to be clear about what we're talking about when we're talking about appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| Ultimately, the legislative body, in this case county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| is responsible for making amendments to the general plan operative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| to passing resolutions which amend the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| and for passing resolutions which amend and change the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| Decisions of the county commission are certainly appealable to the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| In dealing with zone districts that carry the preface planned, planned residential, planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| the zoning ordinance creates a two-step process before development rights are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| One, the zone is created by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| and then the county commission has authorized the planning commission to approve a development plan prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| to any building permits being issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| If someone is aggrieved by a development plan action by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| they can appeal that decision to the county board of zoning appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| whose decision can then be appealed to the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| So there are appeals processes in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| Ultimately, with the exception of the authority that has been granted by the county commission to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| all final approvals are done by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| So county commission is the final authority on plan amendments, on changes to the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2391)|
| 0:40:01| on changes to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| I want to get to Commissioner McKinsey or do you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| It's going to be real quick, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Okay, so we have a piece of property, 15 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| Developer wants to develop a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| It's a good project, but it's in violation of whatever plan that we approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| Walk me through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| Well, most likely the land will probably currently be zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Seventy percent of Knox County is still zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| So the first step is to rezone the property to something that allows residential at something other than a one-acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| Our first check-in with that is to look at the approved land use plan and each of the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| So we get a reading from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| We get a reading from the growth policy plan, and we make a recommendation to the planning commission on that zoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| The planning commission then makes a recommendation to the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| in this case the county commission, on what that property should be zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Most often the request is for a planned residential zone district because our current residential zone districts of R.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:23| and R.B. do not provide the kind of dimensional requirements that the market is trying to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| Quite often R.A. has, for example, a 10,000 square foot minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| People are trying to build units on less than 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| So their only path then is to go planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| So at the time that the zone district is created by county commission, a not to exceed density is attached to that as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:56| That guides us when they come back for the development plan approval, which is the final step of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| That corresponds at the same time with concept plan approval, which is the first step in the subdivision regulations process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| So the approval of the development plan and the approval of the concept plan occur simultaneously in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:20| Should somebody be aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission, a condition or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| in approving a development plan, they can appeal that to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| I wanted to ask you some questions, and one of the things that I was interested in was I attended all the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| all the facilitated meetings, had meetings above and beyond that because I wanted to find out fact versus fiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| I wanted to get the emotionalism out of it, the politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| You can have your own opinions, but you can't have your own facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| I was interested in the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| And fact number one, no one has disputed this yet, that if an individual has a piece of property, they come before the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| They're not satisfied with what the MPC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| That person has an appeals process to either come before this legislative body or the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| Unless I'm missing something, that's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Is that the way it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| That's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Okay, that is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Secondly, I was very interested in looking at the fact that we needed flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| because I think I made the comment on more than one occasion that there are no two pieces of property alike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| and that you might have one piece of property that would have some type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| but then you look at another piece of property and because of slope or whatever it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| that the development might be more appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| but you could not necessarily say that because you developed on Plat A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Plat B might be a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| So I was looking for flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| I was looking for a plan that said just that, that no two pieces of property are the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| that there may be some opportunities for differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| There may be some opportunities for someone to be creative with the way they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| Now, is that in this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| It was my understanding that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| I would say that's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| The recommendation to use planned residential zone districts within the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| and Ridge Top Protection Area provides flexibility through that zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| And then we have added language throughout the facilitated process to directly speak to that in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:33| You'll recall Mr. Della Volpe's paragraph that was added to the preface to the plan that speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:42| to flexibility in two places in the new Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| We directly addressed that with a paragraph that said, I'll paraphrase here rather than read it directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| but, you know, within the constraints of other plans, the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| when warranted by exceptional character or development, character of the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| or development in the surrounding area, may reasonably deviate from these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| So in addition to consistently referring to the recommendations of the plans as recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| and guidelines, we've provided two direct statements that you may reasonably deviate within the constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| of all other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| And then Mr. Della Volpe's paragraph, which we added to the preface, speaks directly to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:37| One caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| I said I attended all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| And I didn't because I couldn't talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| And so most of you would probably like that, that I couldn't talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| But nonetheless, I had to leave because I wasn't feeling well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| So I just wanted to make sure that as we went through this and as we spent the time on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| and as we looked at the language, that the language consistently said that there would be flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| that there would be an opportunity for the appeals process, that no two parcels were the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| that if a developer came before the MPC, that they would be able to use their creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| or their flexibility or their engineering practices or whatever to present the plan that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| and it wasn't kind of a one-size-fits-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| The other thing that I wanted to make sure of is that this plan will be sent to you for a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| In other words, if we vote on it today and it's approved, it's going to come to you for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| And then take me through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| By state law at TCA 13-3304, the legislative body may initiate an amendment to the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:43| by passing a resolution and sending it to the planning commission for its review and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:53| Upon that review, it comes back to the legislative body and you may act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| So, Mr. Law Director, explain to me exactly what we would be doing today if we were to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| We'd be sending it to the MPC and just so I'm fully in my mind understanding what we're doing, it's going to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| He said it's going to come back and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Then it becomes operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| When you send it to MPC, they can either approve it or they can send it back and disapprove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| But bottom line is, regardless of what action they take, you're the final determinant of authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| And then once that becomes the case, it becomes part of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| But if it comes back from MPC, just like last time, we've got to either go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| That's what I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| This is your plan that you're initiating tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| You're not acting on the MPC, the plan that was adopted by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| This is your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| State law simply says that it has to go to the planning commission for its review and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| and literally says that the planning commission may approve, disapprove, transmit without recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| and you can then do whatever you want with that plan when it comes back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| So you can continue to amend it until you get six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| One final question here, and that is with regards to the adoption of ordinances and regulations by the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:20| when you get the plan, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| Now, let's say that the plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| It's sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| MPC approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Where do we go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| The new Section 3 that we added kind of takes you step by step through how you can use the plan and implement the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| One, we use the recommendations of the plan when reviewing requests for amendments to the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:46| We call them sector plans here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Ultimately, those are approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| We use the recommendations when making MPC recommendations on changes to the land use map or to the zoning map, rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2935)|
| 0:49:04| Ultimately, those are approved by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| The MPC will use the recommendations when reviewing development plans to complete the final step of plan to zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:21| Those recommendations get built into the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| They're documented through the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| That's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Should somebody be aggrieved by that plan, they have the appeal process to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:36| And then the plan has a set of recommendations regarding regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| and requirements that would be implemented through changes to ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| And ultimately, the county commission is responsible for approving any changes to the ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| other than the subdivision regulations, which state law gives that authority to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| but we also bring it to the legislative body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Yeah, I just want to make a couple of quick comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| It really has to do with this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| You know, what I'm hearing from an awful lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| even those that are proponents of the plan or people that are in opposition of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| is that we want to be certain that there's an appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| And really what we're doing is we're saying we want this to be advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| We have, you know, one attorney that says that it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| We have other attorneys that say that it's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| We have non-attorneys to say the appeal process is already there and that this new paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| or this new statement is redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| We have non-attorneys that this is not necessary and that it muddies the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| I think it un-muddies the water when we explicitly state that we want this to be advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:57| We don't want a judge because when we have see what the problem is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| is when you have attorneys that disagree, the ultimate authority is going to be a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| And you really don't know how they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| The court's going to look at this and they're not sure what the intention was of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Now, they may still rule one way or the other according to the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| but they really don't know what the intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| And if I think we put the intent in there that this is advisory, we don't intend for it to be binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| we don't intend for this to not have a clear appeals process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| then at least when a court looks at this, they'll understand what the intention of the legislative body was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| Now, to get back to some of the objections, people may think I'm taking one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| If we look at some of the objections about, well, Getty's View wouldn't be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| or that we need to have just an unlimited, you know, property rights, I don't think that's exactly true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3112)|
| 0:52:01| It's that what would happen is if you took a development like Getty's View or Concord Hills in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| and they're all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| They're where I live in River Sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| If you look at those, it's that those could very well be initially rejected by the NPC as developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| because they don't meet any of these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| However, if they may be opposed by the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| and probably they should because the plan says that these are things that we may not want there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| but they would have the right and the opportunity and the intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| if we put this paragraph in there, to bring these before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| We can consider some of the intangibles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| We can look at the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| We can look at the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Is this a good developer or is this not a good developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| We can look at other things that he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| If he's had problems elsewhere, we can say we don't want this to done and we'll stick to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| But if they bring up a good plan, then we have the opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| And talking about it, and, you know, Tony is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| There's developments out here that are an abomination to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| I mean, they're shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| But if someone wants to come in there and correct it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| shouldn't we allow that person to come in there and fix something that's been done wrong before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| In other words, he may come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| We have all these slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| We have these borrow pits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| We have this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| And if these things become binding, we don't even give a developer to try to go back in there and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:32| This is a perfect case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| To me, this is a perfect argument as to why he needs to come back to the county commission and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| look at this mess we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| I know I don't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| You know, we've got 25 degree slopes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| We've got this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| But I would like to have the opportunity to fix it if you'll give me permission to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| I think it's good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| And I think with this amendment, I don't see anything in here where it, in this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| I mean, if somebody has an objection to some word just other than being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| because of where it comes from, then I think I'd like to hear what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| But less explicitly state in there that this is the intention of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| This is the intention of the legislative body to make this advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| There's a lot of good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| There's a lot of good things from the proponents of the plan that can come out of an amendment like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| It lets us fix problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| It lets us prevent problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| It keeps it out of the courts, which must rule according to the letter of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| It lets us consider the intangibles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| And I think it un-muddies the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| If we already have the appeals process there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| this makes it absolutely clear that this is what the intention of the body is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| And for that reason, I would, I propose passing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| And if we pass this, I'm willing to go along with the rest of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Well, we're back and forth on the appeals process, I think, or maybe we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| Maybe we've agreed that the appeals process is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| I guess my question again is to Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| How many times in the document do we state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| or can we cite in the document where this document is advisory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:32| I'd like to know that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Have we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| The term recommendation is used throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| Specifically, in Section 3, Action Step 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| it states the purpose of the regional general plan is to show through maps, charts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| tables, and other descriptive material the planning commission's recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| for physical development of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| in this case within the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| Then it further says this plan is made for the purpose of guiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| and accomplishing a coordinated development of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| The plan guides the distribution of uses of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| So in your opinion, all the way through the document, the document is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| It uses advisory nature language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| And probably the most crucial section of the plan chapter is in around Table 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:39| And the headline of the title of Table 3 is Residential Density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| and Land Disturbance Guidelines for Recommendations on Changes to the Zoning Map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| and Development Plan Concept Plan Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| It further says that the densities are page 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| The first sentence describes how we would use this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| As proposals for changes to the zoning map and development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| and concept plans are considered, the following factors are recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| to determine the overall allowable density for residential rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| and the overall land disturbance allowable in new development or subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| It says recommended maximum density factor, recommended maximum land disturbance factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:32| And in a footnote says these factors should be considered guidelines to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| an overall recommended density for requests to changes to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:45| And further says until such times as regulations are codified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| by the appropriate legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| these factors should be considered guidelines to determine an overall recommended land disturbance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| for development plans and concept plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| That's for that table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Can you construe this to mean the whole document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| Well, I think the same sentiment is expressed throughout the whole document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| It's not spelled out that way, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| And I will be happy to provide you a highlighted copy that highlights every use of the term guideline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:23| or recommendation, but I can't do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| If you have Dr. Briggs' language in front of you as you develop your work plan in the next year, say this is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:43| how will that, how will you be able to even accommodate language like that and write ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:53| And I guess basically my question is you've got to rely on a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| We spend a whole lot of time talking about maps and mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| and we may have a disagreement about 15 percent even though it's been there for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| But if you use words like non-binding to a map, how do you have a non-binding map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| I just don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Well, I would ask how you have a binding or non-binding recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| The same argument could be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| The map will be used in reference to plan amendment and rezoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:36| It clarifies it because currently we have such poor quality slope protection areas mapped that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:44| if a property comes in for a request and we recognize that there are slopes on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| but the land use map in the sector plan isn't showing it, we will apply our rules of thumb to it when we make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:59| So having an accurate GIS-derived geography defined works to everybody's benefit compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:10| to having an inaccurate hand-drawn slope protection area that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| To maybe squash any further discussion whether it's there, it's not, it's there, it's not, it's there, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| If it's in here that many times, what's wrong with putting it in one paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| where everybody can read it in one paragraph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:46| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| I just wanted to comment on perhaps what Commissioner Brown just brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3653)|
| 1:01:02| the fact that it is in here so many times, recommended, recommendation, guide, guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| I've heard from who I consider the experts, Mark Donaldson and our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| that the appeals process that's in place makes this amendment, as much as I respect Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| and he and I spend a great deal of time debating not just this issue but other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| it makes it unnecessary and redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| We have spent a great deal of time on this through the facilitation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:41| working through this with our counterparts in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| And, again, according to the experts who are all involved in crafting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| what we've been through with the facilitator, what we've been through with our fellow legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| and what I'm hearing from the experts here tonight is that this amendment is simply not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:06| This is already covered in this plan, and it's covered well, and it's covered completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| Well, let me follow up with that with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| If you were a lawyer or a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| You're on time number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| But I've got something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| If you're a lawyer or a judge and somebody brings a case before you on something on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| a matter that would be pertaining to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| would you rather read to get clarification, would you rather read one paragraph or 60, 70 pages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| You're asking me directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| To get clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| If I were a judge, I would do my due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| and do whatever research would be necessary to do the proper job at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| It's right there in one paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| It's in this entire plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| And if there's a judge in Knox County who doesn't understand how MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| and the legislative bodies in Knox County works, then they shouldn't be a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| Motion on the floor is to approve with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| A yes vote means that you agree with the amendment and the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| A no vote means that you do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3791)|

| 1:04:14| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Can we get a clarification on the process for Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| Okay, this goes to you, and what next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| We have this scheduled on our December 8th MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| We will ask the Planning Commission to consider approving, disapproving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| or taking no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| It will then come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Our normal rhythm would be to bring it back in January of the month following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| The City Council has specifically asked us to bring it back to their December 13th meeting so that the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:56| sitting council can act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| So we will be honoring that request, and we certainly could schedule it on your December meeting if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:07| But we'll leave that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| I think we're going to have a short month, so I don't know that that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| I don't know what the, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| It's up to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| I'm just asking what the process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Between would be the same this month since we met earlier this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| We still have the same 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| I just want to know the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| It doesn't matter timing on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| We have no other business to come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| but we do have zonings at 6 o'clock, so we will recess until 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| It is 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| It is time for the zoning portion of our Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| Clerk, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=3939)|

| 1:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Sir, the applicant, if you could give us your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| My name is J.T. Chapman, 8424 Asheville Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| Mr. Wright, do you have some questions for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| Are you the property owner or are you the business owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| I'm the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| The people that are going to operate a business, are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Mr. Chairman, this sort of leaves me with a dilemma then because let me speak first with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| Metropolitan Planning Commission people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| The one stipulation that was in the MPC acceptance or approval dealt with a 75-foot buffer of undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:31| vegetation from the property line onto this property that's being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| But there also accompanied this a letter from the proposed operator saying that all of the disassembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:46| would take place inside a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| The only thing that would be outside would be the brought-in cars to be disassembled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| They would be taken inside to be disassembled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| Copper, aluminum, and starters and generators and high-value scrap would be collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:11| placed in Gaylord boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| The remainder, the scrap metal, would then be moved back outside but would always be contained in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| well, would also be placed in containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| I'm asking, is that a condition of this rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:32| That's not a condition that the Planning Commission recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| The Planning Commission recommended the maintenance of a natural undisturbed buffer at the rear of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| because it's adjacent to the new school site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| What happened to the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Mr. Donaldson, what's the difference in this one and the one that we had on Lexington Drive, Murdoch out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| Why don't we not require an industrial for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| Well, the e-mail that we have basically says if we have a problem with the codes department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| we will change operations to conform to CB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| So CB zoning has a long list of allowed uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| With the change of zoning, they could do any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| Couldn't they scrap metal, scrap and sort metal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| The right job is to opine as to which uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| We forced, when we had a property sale out at, I want to say Lexington Drive, we forced them to go industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| Why are we not forcing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Because it's essentially the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| We're scrapping metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| But under the, I guess we opined that Section MM under CB zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| which is any other retail, wholesale, or light industrial use similar in nature to those described in the CB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| Bill Pierce, my plans examiner, formulated a letter that they are limited to all operations inside of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4319)|
| 1:12:10| I have a photo of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| It says we buy scrap metal, starters, alternators, computers, transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| There's not cars on their signs at the front of their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| But they also have issues with toilet facilities at the building at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| So right now their permit would be denied until they come up with a toilet facilities to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| They can't be doing any operations outside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| So that's what we've interpreted the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| So as soon as they park a car out there or as soon as they store some metal or some cars out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| that's not inside the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| That's our interpretation at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| And I have a letter and I made copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| I can bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| I just we forced one of my constituents to go industrial and have a long battle with NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| and neighbors and we're letting this guy do the same, essentially the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| although it not be under roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| Well, no, I take it that this be under roof for this to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| I mean, but as soon as he brings a car in and drops it for awaiting scrapping, he's operating outside by storing scrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Yeah, I guess I'd just like to maybe ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Brad, the reason that it was different out west is I believe the land use plan allowed industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:50| And it's just a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| That's what we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| In this particular case, I believe he came in back during the summer and got part of it rezoned to, I believe, CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:09| And then he came back and the application is for CB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| And in discussions with him, we indicated we wouldn't be likely to support industrial zoning at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| Would or would not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Would not support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| Likely we would not support industrial zoning at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| So there is a difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Plus the other operation was already pretty much existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| They were just changing ownership, making some minor modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| So there is a difference between the two, how we approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| I mean, I understand the thought process, but this one's already existing, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| because he's already taken alternators and whatever listed on the outside of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:55| That's a chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| That's what I was going to ask, maybe if Mr. Seymour would kind of give me his take on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| because I'm a little uneasy about this, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4502)|

| 1:15:16| I am here speaking on behalf of PSC Metals, which may or may not be a competitor of theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| but if they are selling scrap metal, as they say in here, we are competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| Now, we're not trying to keep a competitor out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| PSC asked me to come down here and say they have gone through a six-month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| eight-month process on a similar use on Cogdell Road in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| We just want everybody playing by the same rules we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| PSC Metals out there had property that was zoned CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| and there was an existing salvage yard on there that was operating in the, according to the codes, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| and I'll let Mr. Brayden speak to that, illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| What PSC Metals did, we met with Cogdell, we met with the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| and before PSC purchased that operator and took a lease on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| they went through the zoning process to get it rezoned industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| because we understood the only place you could operate a salvage yard is as a use on review in an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4586)|
| 1:16:35| PSC then went through a use on review process with MPC that set hours limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:47| fencing requirements, foliage requirements, the height at which we could stack material, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:57| And there are a number of conditions on their operation out there which they are abiding by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| Now, the industrial zone permits as a use on review, and this is not permitted anywhere else in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:13| automobile wrecking, junk, and salvage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| Well, the definitions in the zoning ordinance describe an auto wrecking yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:25| any space or building used by the owner or operator for the dismantling of two or more inoperable vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| or vehicles not in running condition or for storage of such vehicles or the dismantled parts thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:45| So, based on the description in the e-mail which is attached to the MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4665)|
| 1:17:56| all materials except automobiles is unloaded inside the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| Appliances are stripped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| And then scrap metal from automobiles, appliances are placed in roll-away containers which are placed outside in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:14| Well, that's what PSC is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| And PSC was required, and I didn't disagree with this, to obtain industrial zoning for that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4697)|
| 1:18:28| and to go through the use on review procedure where there was a public hearing about the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| that were placed on their operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| I know Commissioner Anders and Commissioner McKenzie were very familiar with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| because we had lengthy discussions with the neighbors on Cogdell Road about how we would operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| And immediately adjacent to this property is where the new elementary school is going out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| So I would assume Knox County would be very interested also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| We are not asking that this operation be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| We are simply asking that they follow the same rules that PSC Metals went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| when they developed this yard on Cogdell Road, the same procedures they went through when they developed a salvage yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:22| and shredder at the Forks of the River Industrial Park, and the same procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| The city is a little different, but the same procedures that they did in South Knoxville and off Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| We think competition is good, but everybody ought to play by the same rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| And that's basically why I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| Yes, so, you know, no disrespect to whoever may opine on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| but it does sound a whole lot like a salvage yard to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| And that's part of the reason why we recommended what he requested, which was CB zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4797)|
| 1:20:05| because of the list of uses under CB zoning, which does not include what his real proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| And we had, according to the email, we advised him that we wouldn't support industrial zoning because of his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:22| But the CB zoning, we were comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| You're fine with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| So I think that's what Commissioner Wright's biggest issue is, and I'll defer to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| but I'm comfortable now that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| So you're supporting a CB zoning, but not a scrap yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| And what you're defining as his business is a scrap yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| That's not our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Roy, but your Roy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| This letter that my plans examiner has said is scrap metal recycling in a CB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| It says nothing in here about auto wrecking yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| We would be approving scrap metal recycling fully contained within a building, not dismantling vehicles or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:10| So, basically, we're going to approve them to do a process inside of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| If they're pulling in cars, then they're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| It's not approved in a CB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| And this letter details what they can and can't do specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| So they can do recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Our zoning ordinance is not up to date as it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| There needs to be some updating of such as recycling centers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| I don't think there's a problem with this as long as they follow what our review says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| But we are not approving an auto wrecking yard in a CB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| So what's your process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| You get a report that they're taking in cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| You go up there and you kind of sit across the road and you watch them taking a couple of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| You write them a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| They're still operating and taking in cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Do you have the ability to shut that business down, lock the doors, padlock them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| I believe we would do that and or we would get the law director to file something against them to stop them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:13| if we couldn't stop them with a citation and or civil penalties to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| I mean, I had one thing about what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| On PSC metals, part of the use on review is that they will not even accept automobiles at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:32| They are telling the automobile recyclers to take them to Central Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| or to the forks of the River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| We're a recycling facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| We take aluminum cans, scrap metals of any kind, minimal processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| A lot of it's done in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| We level up metal and metal cans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| and they send it from there out to the forks of the river for further processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| All we're doing is accepting metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| They're on Cogdell Road and doing minimal processing so they can be shipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| If it's too big, you have to bail it so it'll fit in a trailer and it goes out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| But we were still required to have industrial zoning and a use on review for that type of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| which we thought was proper after discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| And we just want our competitors to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| Mr. Chapman, would you like to respond to any of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| I'm only here to get my property rezoned to CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| My tenants and whatever problems they may have are their problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| I just want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| My property should have been zoned CB when I bought it back in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| I was doing the same thing these people are doing, only I was doing it with industrial machinery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| I used the building in the back as a storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| We took machinery apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| We stored the parts back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| I stored the machinery outside for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| No one's ever complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| But I was told I should be CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| Everything I do out there should be CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| So I've never been in the zoning I should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| No, we need to plow a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| This letter that is prepared by DUSA Metals, is that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| I am the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| And your name is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| J.T. Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| When I scroll on down to the bottom of the page, it says, thanks, J.T. Chapman, and gives the telephone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Did you submit this letter on behalf of DUSA Metals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Therein is where I was confused a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| This letter that's before us, I believe in its first sentence, says that the automobiles will be unloaded outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5097)|
| 1:25:07| All material except autos unloaded inside the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| So autos would be unloaded outside or stored outside the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| So is this going to become a code violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| If they receive automobiles, that would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:34| I do not disagree with your rezoning if MPC approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| But I believe we're going to have a problem with the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| This is one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| We're rezoning three buildings out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| That I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| The whole discussion is one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| I believe that what I have the motions on the floor is that this rezoning to CB as recommended by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5161)|
| 1:26:14| with one stipulation, that's 75 foot of greenway left undisturbed at the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:25| I believe that I support the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| It's the usage that code is going to get you on, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| I'm not using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| It's not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| And that's the reason that I support you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| The motion is approved by MPC with one stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:44| Was there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| And Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| Mr. Chapman, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| You said there are three buildings on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| They are leasing or renting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| What are you doing with the other two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| I have one building that is 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| It has four truck docks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| It is strictly storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| I have one company, Temkin Company, leases half of the building, 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| And I have two other tenants in the rest of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| The building next door, 8424 Asheville Highway, is being used for storage also right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| A lot of it is my material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| Some of it has been overflow material from the people in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| But it's mainly mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| So this one building we're talking about here, is it empty now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| Or is it half full, you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| 8424?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| The one that we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| Well, you're looking at rezoning the whole piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Everything, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Because the operation I've had out there all these years does not fall under CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| It falls under CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| Well, as Commissioner Wright said, the problem is going to be and somehow we need to communicate this to the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5270)|
| 1:28:00| Have they already rented it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| You already signed the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| No lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| Are they already renting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| They're renting it, but no lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Are they operating in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| So they're operating illegally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| The only thing I know, there's every inspector has been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| The EPA has been out there and gave them a clean bill of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| I don't know who else is going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| But that is not my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| My problem is I need my property zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| You're kind of caught in the middle on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Well, I'm not caught in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| I'm just wanting the property rezoned to CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Now, if the codes don't want these people out there, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| They have told me that they would do what they needed to do to conform to stay where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:52| They're right now buying property over in Jefferson City, not in Jefferson City, but Jefferson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| in case they need another yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| How long have they been in this location with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Off the top of my head, four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| The motion on the floor is to approve per MPC recommendation with one stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5350)|

| 1:29:23| Page 10, 10-J-11-RZ is a request of Walter McMillan for rezoning from A agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5363)|
| 1:29:31| to RA low-density residential property located north side of North Ruggles Ferry Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| east of Blake Lane in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| Sir, if you'd come forward to the podium, someone may have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| Move to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5393)|

| 1:29:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Let's go back to and see if the individual is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| Aaron Presley on Stamps Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| If I could, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| I think all the people sitting left and everybody that's opposed to Stamps Lane, if you'll stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| We can't hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| We may hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| We're going to put it off until the next meeting in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| We've generally given people that right to fail to show up one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| But if she doesn't show next month, it will be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| Thank you for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Does anybody want to approach or say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Yes, please come to the podium if you'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| You all can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| I just wanted to let everybody know you all were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| We thought you all were here just because you enjoyed being here and to experience a zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| We're wanting an update on the score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| Can you pull the microphone to you and give your name and address, please, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| My name is Helen McLean Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| I live on Stamps Lane, joining Ms. Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| I moved in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| I was the first one to move in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| We didn't have nothing but a rock road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| We had to have it paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| We had to put lights and water in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| And I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| I went to pay my taxes and it said residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| Well, I've been getting this mail on rezoning from the metropolitans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:40| And I'm wondering about this because Mr. Browning was my brother's wife's father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:51| And he's the one that sold the property to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| He sold those lots on Stamps Lane on both sides, two and a half acres to each individual that bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5514)|
| 1:32:06| And we've had trouble ever since we've been in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| Ms. Presley put a daycare in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| And we have a road is not permittable much for the ones that live there to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:22| I mean, we have a lot of traffic coming out of Broad Acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| We have a lot of traffic coming from these other off roads that come on to Stamps Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:37| The school bus lets the children off at Camberley because they can't hardly --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| The bus, the school bus can't stop on that road to let the children go off at their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:53| They have to walk by my house and go down the road because of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| And I'm just wondering why that mine was residential when I paid my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| Because Mr. Browning said he wanted that when we bought from him, wanted it to be left a culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5587)|
| 1:33:19| So I'm wondering about this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| I'm wondering if she hadn't been living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| The house on the road, the lady told me that's a renting from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| Her lease is not up until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| And the first people that bought that was Mr. Presley, Bobby's father and mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5618)|
| 1:33:48| And they, her and her husband had been in a squabble and they were divorced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| It's just a messed up situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| And about our road, though, is what I'm more concerned about is us getting in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:05| And people from Broad Acres have to come that way because it's shorter to get to Food City, to get to the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:15| And it's just a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| Thank you, ma'am, for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Anybody else like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| So we'll postpone it another 30 days until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| I believe we've got a gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Come forward and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| I'd like to make a motion to postpone it until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| Go ahead and speak, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Gene Scrivner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| I've been with 825 Camberley for the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| I understand we're going to have a hearing next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| If she shows, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Well, one thing I want to talk about is the road and the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:04| The MPC did not do any homework on this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| Mrs. Presley operated a successful child care center there in the basement of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| And a couple of months ago, she moved down to Broad Acres or not Broad Acres but Powell Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:27| The reason she moved is they would not renew her license because they said Stamps Lane was too narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:36| and dangerous for a child care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| Can you pull the microphone away from your shirt there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Did you hear all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| So, you know, MPC said there would be no traffic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| There's already a traffic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| There's a Stamps Lane is roughly about two blocks long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| There's 21 mailboxes on the right-hand side of the road going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| There's only a dirt shoulder on the side of the pavement there about a foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| And all the mailboxes are right on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| If two cars are meeting and they're meeting at a mailbox, they cannot pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| One of them has to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Yet MPC says no impact on traffic, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| And I could go on and I'll be back, I guess, in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| But be aware of what recommendations you get from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| They do not do their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| There's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| I called October the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| I called the tax assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| The two pieces of property, the house and the back lot, was owned by Bobby Presley and Aaron Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5808)|
| 1:36:59| That was when the MPC meeting was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| I called the tax assessor's office Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| The house has been transferred to somebody else's name, a Luther Henley that I don't know, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| And but we believe Mrs. Presley has a buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| The fact is one of our neighbors called and talked to her about buying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| She wouldn't even talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| She said, I'll get back with you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| But later never did come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| But she has a buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| She knows what she's going to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| MPC asked her three times what her intentions were for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| The reason she gave for wanting rezoning was she wanted a smaller yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:51| Which yard is she talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| She doesn't live in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| She's got it leased out for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| And she also has it for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| So it is a mixed up situation that we have a high population in that area of senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:14| And the MPC sign kept going up and down, up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| A lot of people never did see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| I never did see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:20| I've been to Stamps Lane three or four times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| Another lady on Stamps Lane said that she didn't know what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| When she'd go by one time, there'd be a sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| The next time she goes by, it's not up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Anyway, we circulated a petition against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| And just in a matter of about a day and a half, we got 92 names on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:45| But we're just, as senior citizens, our property is already taking a big hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| And it's fixing to take another big hit if we get something in there that's not agreeable with the surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5931)|
| 1:39:00| Most of these houses are owned by Camberley and Norwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| And these are $200,000 houses, which is not a lot nowadays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| Anyway, those houses today are about worth $160,000 or $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| We get another undesirable situation here, and they're going to be worth less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| So we senior citizens are just trying to protect the value of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| And one other thing, the last thing I want to say, we were treated so rude by the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:35| they completely ignored us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| They asked me one question, my name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| They asked Ms. Presley three times what she intended to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| And all three times it was she wanted a smaller yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| I think that's a ridiculous excuse to wanting property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Sir, could you give us your name one more time for the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| Gene, G-E-N-E Scrivener, S-C-R-I-V-E-N-E-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| The motion on the floor is to postpone until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6007)|

| 1:40:43| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| Amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| This is O-11-11-102, consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| amending Article 2, Section 2.20, Pacific Terms, Article 5, Section 5.40, Office Park Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| and Section 5.41, Office Medical and Related Services Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| and adding a new section 4.82 to Article 4 regarding requirements of the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| and operation of pain management clinics and uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| Ordinance number O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, is amended on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| Ordinance 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| I have received some, I'm sure you've had correspondence from attorneys and some others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| asking that they be allowed to speak with us about unintended consequences of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| I'm in favor of this, but I think they deserve an opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| Where are they at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| There are several of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| But these are not what you would consider pain or pill mills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| but they have asked for an opportunity and their representatives to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| So we can pass this on first reading with the understanding I'd like to give them the opportunity to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Just real quick, I gave some stuff to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| Joe, have you had time to, any changes that that doctor gave that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| I mean, he marries his valid points, but points that were already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| basically he had questions about enforceability and that's already in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| And noncompliance, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Very good, lucid comments, but I think things that are already covered in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| And if you'll just keep those on file for me, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| Yes, sir, I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Yeah, I think I forwarded it on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| You may not have had a chance to check your e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| It's a letter from the Knoxville Academy of Medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| and I'll remind you that the Knoxville Academy of Medicine represents physicians' interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| But I'm going to read this to everyone, and it says, to the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| the Knoxville Academy of Medicine has a growing concern for the overutilization of pain medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| The increase in the number of pain clinics, some of whom may be more interested in pushing medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| than in caring for sick patients, requires that these treatment settings be regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| Patients deserve to be treated in a pain clinic that is designed to help them manage their pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| We do not support pain clinics looking to capitalize on drug addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| As physicians caring for patients, we applaud the Knox County Commission's involvement in addressing this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| We respectfully request that you use due diligence in determining the difference between reputable pain clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6186)|
| 1:43:14| and pill mills for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| Now, that was signed by the president of the Knoxville Academy of Medicine this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:24| and it was also approved by their board of trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| I would like to add that I've had conversations with Tennessee Medical Association in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| as well as their attorneys, and I think it's called the Tennessee Anesthesia Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| who would represent really the pain clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| And after talking with them, they have a representative here at Knoxville that runs a legitimate pain clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| and they are all in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| And I think just as, you know, part of our responsibilities as the legislative body for the county is to protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:58| health and well-being of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| And I think most people would agree that or not most people, but there's a lot of people who would agree the number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| health problem, public health problem in our community is this, these prescription pain medicines that are floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| There's been a long series of articles in the paper about a young man, 18, 19 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| who eventually lost his life because of these pain medications that were too easy for him to obtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| So I think we need to think about that going forward and not get confused with any so-called legal arguments against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| If the attorneys are coming from some of the legitimate pain clinics, I think we can let them know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| that the legislative intention of this body is not to restrict legitimate pain clinics that are helping people with cancer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6281)|
| 1:44:49| and other very bad problems, but to clamp down on the ones that are just selling drugs that are turning around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| and showing up on our streets and endangering lives, you know, of our citizens and particularly of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| And I would very, very strongly advocate for passing it tonight and then passing it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| I'm all in favor of passing it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| But anyone who wants to speak directly to the ordinance, I think they need to have the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| We will invite them to come to our next meeting or our workshop and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Dr. Briggs put it very eloquently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| I think that's the way to do it, first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| I have been contacted by, I guess, five people in the last four or five days saying unintended consequences, as you related to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:35| Now, let me ask, and I thought to Joe about it, if somebody's in there now and falls below the thousand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| they're grandfathered, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| I mean, when you pass zoning regulations, they're never retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| They're always going to be prospective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| So if you're a legitimate clinic currently in operation, this will have no effect on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| If you're illegitimate, you're still subject to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| This is really the only mechanism you have because the state preempts a lot of the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| Throughout the country, those counties and states that have seen a proliferation of illegal pill mills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| zoning has been a very good methodology to weed out the weed from the chaff, the legitimate from the illegitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| I have had a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| I asked the sheriff this morning or this afternoon and I talked to Chief Rouse last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| and their opinion has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| They are totally -- they think this is the way to move on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| And I'm going to encourage, I hope you guys will too, when we're contacted by these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| whether they're lobbyists, pharmaceutical salesmen, some guy owns real estate, wants to rent it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| to come down here in a month and give us their pitch on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| That would be the opportunity for them to come and address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| Otherwise, if they don't show up, then they don't -- they've had the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| This may be more to the MPC or the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| It's one of the alphabet things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| If someone does come down and we have a very legitimate pain clinic that's being established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| you know, where they're treating cancer patients with injections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| I mean, things that, you know, they should be doing, but they don't fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| or they would fall within that 1,000-foot issue that I've heard some complaints about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| Would either the MPC or the county commission have the opportunity to give them a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:25| or a use on review or whatever for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| Or how strict is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Because that is in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| The way that the recommendation is set up is that a pain management clinic is finally defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| and it's listed as a use permitted on review, and then we created these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| Now, the one thing that we kind of created out of thin air is that 1,000-foot distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:53| At least one ordinance that I recall from Florida just said that they should not co-locate with a pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| So you may want to adjust that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| I think where that came from, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| As you know, that came from the methadone clinics where you actually we didn't want those around schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| even legitimate clinics, because you are dealing with people who are drug addicts that are coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| I mean, they're people who are looking for help and they're doing it in a medically legitimate way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| but you still just don't want drug addicts around certain places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| But we would have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| I'm not saying we need to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| I'd like to leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| But if someone did come and ask, even though we passed the ordinance and it's still in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| we would have the opportunity to give them a variance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| Well, we could probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| I mean, you may not, but if they appealed it to the commission, could we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| I mean, the case under review would go to the BZA, but we could directly impact this by changing shall to should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:57| clearly making it a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| Or make it a recommendation or something to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| That would be the only wordsmithing that I would, you know, that I would look at on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| because, you know, sometimes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| just the way things are is that you could end up with a co-location where it's not relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| That's the only objection that I've heard from some of the legitimate people about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:20| Well, then you go from the mandatory shall to the permissive should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| and that gives you some flexibility as a body politic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| Yeah, but I guess my question on that is, is that significant enough to take us back to first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| We approve this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| They change the shall to a should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Are we back at first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| I don't think so, because really the overall intent here is to implement zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| and planning restrictions as a regulatory measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| Motion on the floor is to approve on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Any other business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part2?start=6593)|
