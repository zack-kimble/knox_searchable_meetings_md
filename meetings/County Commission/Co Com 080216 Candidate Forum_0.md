| 0:00:00| Let it be noted that all commissioners are here except for Ivan Arman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=0)|
| 0:00:24| I think he's on his way, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=24)|
| 0:00:29| Today we're going to have interviews of the fee officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| We also have two other interviews, one from the second district and one from the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| These people couldn't come the other day, so I wanted to go ahead and get it over with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| so Wednesday after intergovernmental, or Tuesday after intergovernmental and finance, we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| just wrap up whatever we need to do without having interviews, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=51)|
| 0:00:58| First on the list will be Register D, Sherry Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=58)|
| 0:01:05| All interviewees will have five minutes to say what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=65)|
| 0:01:13| After that, any commissioner can ask them questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| After each office, anyone from the audience can have two minutes to say what they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Ms. Sherry Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| I'm Sherry Witt, and I'm seeking the appointment to the Knox County Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| I'm a lifelong resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| I'm a graduate of Fulton High School and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| I'm a member of Corrington Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| I have two wonderful daughters, Shea, who is a graduate of East Tennessee State University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| and Chelsea, who is currently attending Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| As you can see in my resume, I have numerous community interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| The one I'm most proud of is my 11-year commitment to the boards of the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| While I feel my educational background and my community involvement is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| that's not why I'm here before you seeking this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| When I started in Knox County government out of college, I had no idea that it was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| to be a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| This is not to be confused with a career politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| My name was first on the ballot February 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| At that time, I received approximately 63% of the Republican vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| I was very humbled by those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| I started in the registrar's office as a secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| I was promoted to bookkeeper and then promoted to chief deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Knox County has spent 24 years educating me on how to be a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| There's no classroom in the United States that can teach you these kind of skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| I believe, as I hope you will, that it's time for the citizens of Knox County to reap the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| rewards of the time they have invested in my education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| How I feel about being a public servant can best be described by an incident that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| about seven months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| While in the registrar's office, we had an elderly gentleman, Mr. Reidner, to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| and ask that we remove his wife's name from a deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| I tried to tell him that we could not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| We didn't add names or delete names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| We simply, when the instrument came up there, we recorded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| He was insistent that we do that and that he'd been up there two years before and we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| simply added the name to the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| So as I sent Bill Bright back to the back to get a copy of his deed to see what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| talking about, he kept arguing with me and said, I know I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| I want to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Will you do it for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| And I said no and tried to explain to him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Well, he was very insistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| So finally, I said, he said, I want to see your boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| So I said, well, Mr. Reidner, I am the registrar right now and I'm telling you, I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| tell you anything to deceive you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| So he kept on and I said, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| So feeling like he had finally broke me, we walked back to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| As we passed one of the windows in the back and he could see his reflection in the window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| I said, Mr. Reidner, I'd like to introduce you to my boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| He looked at me like I was from another planet, maybe Mars or something like that and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| You're the boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| You are a taxpayer of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| This office belongs to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| You pay my salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| And that's exactly how I feel about being a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| I have a new friend and Mr. Reidner, he calls me quite frequently about once a month to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| chew me out about something that's in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| And I, but he will always end it with saying, I know this in the registrar's office because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| you all wouldn't even change a name on my deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| So he didn't exactly ask, understand what he was asking, but I think you get the gist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| of what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Gentlemen, I know most of you on a professional basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| When you have a constituent with a problem, you come to the registrar's office and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| You found the staff up there to be courteous and professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| The records are always accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| I would like to thank you for your time and I sincerely appreciate your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| with this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| I look forward to answering any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| Are there any questions for Ms. Witt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| I have just a quick question over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| We're approaching what everyone agrees will be a very tight budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| How does the registrar of deeds office compare in terms of costs to similar sized counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=323)|
| 0:05:33| Would you be willing to prepare a budget that anticipates a 10% cut or a reduction in staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=333)|
| 0:05:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| We're already working on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| Our budget this year has a 7% decrease right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| As far as comparing it with other counties, first I might add that in our budget, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| no other county in Tennessee that pays rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| More than half of our budget in Knox County is for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| I'm not sure what kind of services that some of these other counties offer, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| what the citizens of Knox County expect in this county and I feel like that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| But again, I have been fortunate enough to be looking at the budget already and we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| have a 7% decrease in mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Commissioner Harmon asked a few questions that I was going to ask you, Ms. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| I know you're familiar with the budget because you've been there for so long as chief deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| Would it be possible for you, when you forward a copy of your budget to the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| to forward one to each one of us commissioners where we could have a little advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Certainly, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| We don't get them until about a month before we have to vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| It's hard for us to digest everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| I just wonder if you could forward each commissioner a copy of your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| I'd be glad to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| Are there any other questions, Ms. Witt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| I got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| I got one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Ms. Witt, go ahead and speak to the issue of rent then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| You mentioned rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Talk to us about rent in terms of your office and what you feel as you scrutinize your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=434)|
| 0:07:23| and is there some place for us to make some savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| Commissioner, that's not my forte, is the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| That's just what we've had to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| It's about $130,000 is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| Do we like it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Is it what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| That would be probably more of an issue for you all to discuss than it would be for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| I just want to make a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| Sherry, I've known you 20, 30 years and known you in the Richard Deeds office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| You have always been very professional in everything that you do from day one since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| I've met you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| There's things that go on in every single office holder's office, but anytime anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| has any questions about you or your office, you're always very upfront, laid on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| and here's what the facts are, and you don't try to hide things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| I just want to applaud your professionalism, what you have always done, and I think what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| you will continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| In the registrar's office, there's two paths that you can walk on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| One's very narrow and one's very wide, and that's in county government all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| We've been walking on that narrow path, so it's not hard for us to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| We always try to do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| I've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Ms. Wood, speaking of the narrow path, would you refer to the narrow path in reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| to Steve Hall and sort of your thinking process in the hiring back of Steve after the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=531)|
| 0:09:00| Just tell us what took place within you, what you were feeling about, justify your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=540)|
| 0:09:11| I stand by my decision to hire Steve Hall back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| It was a decision that I made about a month and a half after I was appointed registrar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Steve Hall has 26 years' experience in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| He was overwhelmingly elected for 26 years by the people of this county to serve as registrar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| Term limits in the Supreme Court said that he could not serve as registrar anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| I had a position as administrative assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| I looked at those jobs, what it took to take care of that kind of job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| I feel like there's no one else in Knox County with that kind of experience that Steve Hall has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| that could fill that position, and I still stand by that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| And I work with him every day, and I can't tell you how much his services are appreciated in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=594)|
| 0:10:04| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Is there anyone from the audience that would like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you, Ms. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Anyone from the audience that would like to speak on Ms. Witt's behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| Or just about the position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Or about registering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Just anything to do with that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| No one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| No one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Well, we'll move on to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| Jimmy J.J. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=634)|
| 0:10:44| Jimmy Jones, 5212 Winfield Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Let me start by saying I'm 49 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| I've lived in Knox County since I was six months old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| I grew up in the Cumberland States area, and I graduated from West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| I have a bachelor's degree from Tuscaloosa College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| and a master's degree in criminal justice from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| I started my employment with the sheriff's office in 1980 as a correctional officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| and I moved through the ranks of the patrol division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| and into the Metro Narcotics Union, where I served as a sergeant for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| Ultimately, I was promoted to the lieutenant in charge of the major crimes division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| and after that, I was the chief of detectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| which was charged with all investigations that occur in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| In 1999, I was an initial member of a newly created unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| at the Knoxville Police Department called the Cold Case Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| We were ultimately credited with solving and convicting the I-275 sniper and the UT rapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| I returned in 2005 to the sheriff's department as the assistant chief of administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| where I served until 2007 when I was promoted to sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| As you can see by my resume, I have thousands of hours of specialized training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| My education, specialized training, and my on-the-job experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| set me apart from any other candidate seeking this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| I've spent my entire adult life preparing for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| Now let's talk about the appointment process that happened on January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| On January 31st, I was appointed by a 19-member commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| No recesses, no empty seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| Every one of you sitting here voted for me in favor of that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| Some say that seeking this reappointment is politically incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| and is a kiss of death for the August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| I'm not a career politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| I'm a career law enforcement officer, and I've never made a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| based on being politically correct or politically incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| From the very beginning, I said I would seek reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| And maybe let me relate just a small story to you to show you the way I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| Hank Aaron, in his rookie year, was hit by a pitch in the head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| and knocked him to his knees and almost knocked him unconscious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| When the trainer came out and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| come on, let's go to the dugout, we'll put a pinch runner in for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| he said, no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| When he finds out that I'm soft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| every pitcher in the league will try to intimidate me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| That's the same way with public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| We must stand strong, and we cannot be intimidated by politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| Now is the time for us to continue what we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| I'll be happy to answer any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| J.J., looking at your resume here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| I see you were the liaison officer assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| to Knox County District Attorney's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| and you were also in the special co-squad case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| at the City Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| It looks like you would have good relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| with both the City Police Department and the District Attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| But what I'm wanting to ask you right now is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| do we have one of these co-case squads in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| We have a co-case squad in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| As a matter of fact, we started about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| We've already started going back and looking through cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| Some of the cases go back as far as the early 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| So we're trying to see what kind of information we have on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| what we can find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| As a matter of fact, we have contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| getting ready to contact some of our retired detectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| that still are in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Herman Johnson, Chief Maples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| some people that used to work those murder cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| and we're going to get in contact with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| and we look forward to it being up and running very, very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| Okay, I'm certainly glad we got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| There's another question that I'd like to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| that you've probably heard before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| and don't get mad at me when I ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| What is your answer to the people who say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Tim Hutchison is still running the Sheriff's Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Well, you know, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| that is the first time I've ever heard that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| I have heard that question a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| and I'll respond to you the same way I've always responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Since January 31, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Tim Hutchison has never asked to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| never has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| or never would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| involved in any decision-making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| at the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Judge, I've got a curious question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I know the men respect you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| in your force respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Do you get much time with your job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Do you get out in the field much with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| or go on any of the bus with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| How much time are you out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| You know, I really don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| and it's a shame to say because I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| I was going to say, did you miss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| I've been doing that for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Now, sometimes, if there's going to be a narcotics raid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| that we know about in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| I do go out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| And I do go out sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| when we have the DUI sobriety saturations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| I'll ride with the DUI unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| It's hard on me to stay up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning anymore, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| I understand how much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| that you get to spend out in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| if you still like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| This is a very time-consuming job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| and if anyone had told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| I thought I had always been close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| to knowing what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| the job that the sheriff did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| I realized how much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| is consumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| in this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| JJ, I know that relationships now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| with the City Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| are much better than what they used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| How do you feel about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| the relationship with them now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| and what do you intend to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| to foster that, to make that even better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| We have a wonderful working relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| with the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Sterling Owen, when I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| on the Metro Narcotics Unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| before we had SWAT teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| we used their SWAT teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| on high-risk entries and narcotics search warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| So I've known Sterling for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| We've got some great plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| I don't want to talk about them right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| but we've got some joint ventures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| that we're moving toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I can give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| one of the best cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Just the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| when we got the murderer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| the guy that killed the guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| on Virginia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| it was City and County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| both departments together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| worked on that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| and ultimately took the person into custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| So we work our guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| and their guys' talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Yeah, JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Your predecessor was known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| in the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| He took a more rural-type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| department and turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| it in, in his long career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| into a more metropolitan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| suburban area-type department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| What plans do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| have for continued modernization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Well, you know, and it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| I can tell you, when I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| in 1980 to the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| the first car I had was five years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| and had 120,000 miles on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| and was happy to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| We went from an agency at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| in time that had to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| help from other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| for any specialized units we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| needed. It is completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| totally opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| now. They call us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| when they need bomb squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| canine dogs. We are a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| service Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| and I continue, I will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| to push for that. We have computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| and cars, you know, just in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| five years. The technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| in the police field is phenomenal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| and you have to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| what's going on to stay up-to-date with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| latest tools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| we've worked hard on that and we'll continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| to work hard on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Commissioner Hallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Same question about tight budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| the number of employees exceeds a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| in the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| How does that compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| with jurisdictions of similar size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| and as we approach a tight budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| would you be willing to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| a budget that includes reductions in staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| or up to a 10% cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Well, we do have over a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| employees, but you must remember we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| have 1,100 prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| So, we basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| operate a prison, not a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| So, each and every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| employee we have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| they're needed. There's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| fat in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| The budget that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| proposed last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| was a 1%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| reduction in operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| It was 3% larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| than the year before only because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| of salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| When asked to produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| a lean budget, that's what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| done. And if asked to do that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| Commissioner Hallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Judge, I am a little bit curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| that you deal with the public so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| and what I'd like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| is how do you handle not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| complaints from the citizens, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| how do they really get in touch with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| the Sheriff's Department like speeders and subdivisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| I'm not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| misconduct on officers, but just a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| For complaints and subdivisions such as speeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| we set up a patrol division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| hotline that they can call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| It's monitored every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Chief Ronnie Chamberlain and Ben Harkins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| are in charge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| When someone calls in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| and asks for a radar to be shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| at Straw Plains Pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| then what we do with our traffic division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| is we forward that to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| and they go shoot radar up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Citizen complaints are something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| we take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| I take about 45 minutes to an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| every day to return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| every phone call that comes to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| I don't think you'll find a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| in Knox County that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| they've not been able to get a hold of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| I get my cell phone number out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| at every meeting I go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| and I return every phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| that's asked of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| How do they get in touch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| You say you have a hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Is that posted in the telephone book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| It is posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| All the community meetings that we go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| the Neighborhood Watch meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| we communicate with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| email in the Neighborhood Watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| and try to keep them up-to-date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| and up-to-speed on what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| in Knox County and in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| I guess the last question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| we've heard so much about these dog bite cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Is this something now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| with some of the things that we've passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| that you work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| the Humane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| and the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| is that something that you coordinate together now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| There's been some ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| that are trying to be passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| to change the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| on the dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| and particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| who has responsibility for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| But certainly we answer those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| and we work with the Humane Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| JJ, when you take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| at your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| about what percent of your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| do you have with prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| and the incarceration side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| About two-thirds or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| No, it's probably not that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Probably 50 to 60 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| maybe about half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| A little half or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| I'd have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| How are we doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| as far as our numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| and staying in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| with our jail downstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| We're doing unbelievably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| well at the East Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| It was my decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| to double bunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| some beds out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| that had never been double bunked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| So we ultimately created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| about an extra 196 beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| by putting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| to a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| We are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| going through the ACA accreditation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| which we are accredited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| at our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| The numbers downstairs, I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| in the last two weeks have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| about 195 to 198| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| with 215 at the cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| So as far as the numbers in our jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| we feel like we're doing good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| The question about budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| that we're spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| phenomenal amounts of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| on medicine and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Even though we're spending more on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| we're still maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| the lowest level on our budget we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| I think we do a great job out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| It's a tough place to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| and it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| a lot of money to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Without opening that pod you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| do you think we would still be in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| We would be in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| but it would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| that you would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| be involved with every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| not to let it go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| That was the best thing that could have ever happened to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| The survey showed we should have opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| our pods by now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| which of course at $15 million a pod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Without that pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| we would be in serious, serious trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| On the same line there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| talking about your employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| you've got 1,000 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| and you're talking about the prison slash jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| How many employees do we have over there at the center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| I can't tell you exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| I'd say roughly 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Somewhere around that, 650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Do you foresee anything in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| next year that's increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| decreased? Have you gotten that far yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| We've looked at it and we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| we can do the same thing that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| I think ultimately our operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| expense on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| that we sent up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| y'all was 1% lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| than the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| If managed right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| we can do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| As I said, the overall budget increase was 3%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| but that was due to employee raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you, JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1534)|

| 0:26:16| in criminal justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| I served the city of Knox as a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| for 37 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1580)|

| 0:26:38| and Shrine Paper Sale fundraising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| are a few of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| that occupy my spare time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| I am qualified and available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| to serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| It is not necessary for me to remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| that I have spoken very loudly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| and clearly their sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| The primary election just passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| was a clear demonstration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| that business as usual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| will not be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Just as Caesar's wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| the actions of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| must be above reproach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| One of the first actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| the January 31, 2007 Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| did was to appoint J.J. Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| as Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| As I look to the upcoming appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| I have made the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| to seek the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I am an alternative candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| I have no long-term ambitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| or desires to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| beyond the interim period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| As I watched Ruthie Coleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| on a television interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| I want the citizens to put me in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| not the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| I was so impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| by the nobility of her statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| that I was moved to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| that the choice was also decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| by the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| If the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| want J.J. Jones to serve as their Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| let the citizens elect him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| I also was appalled to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| that a Knox County employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| worked at the polls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| on County time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| As Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| I will see the violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| of the law are enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| I am basically a crime fighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| and I will expect my department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| to fight crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| and not politic on duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| for any candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| What they do off-duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| is a personal decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| they can make for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| It is important for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| not to give the appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| of business as usual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| among the courthouse crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| An appointment of Mr. Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| will almost certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| be perceived by the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Thank you for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1722)|

| 0:28:56| through my election process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1736)|

| 0:29:00| at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1740)|

| 0:29:08| of the vote you received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| was in favor of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1750)|

| 0:29:20| City Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| What rank did you hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| in that police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| I was a Criminal Investigator 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| How many people did you supervise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| I didn't supervise any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| You made a remark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| about people working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| on county time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| This is something I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| on the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| This is something I heard on the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Mr. Presley, you talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| about the fact that you feel that you're qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Can you tell me what experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| you've had with budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| We know that the Sheriff's Department has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| a significant amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| that runs through it in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| not only the day-to-day operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| with officers on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| but also with the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| There are a number of programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| that the Sheriff's Department is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| You're talking about a sizable budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Could you tell me the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| that you've had in dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| with this kind of budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| The experience I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| but that is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| When I said I'm qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| I'm qualified by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| That's what I meant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| that I'm qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| The budget, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| will be coming to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| and we have to approve it by July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Whoever gets this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| is going to have to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| and go over the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| and present their budget to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| I'm going to follow up on a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| that Commissioner Pinkson asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| about supervisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| With over 1,000 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| how do you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| that you would be qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| to come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| administer this department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| over the next six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| I'm very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| acquainted with the leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| in Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| I am qualified to work with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Mr. Presley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| I just heard from J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| saying that maybe 50 to 60 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| of his budget deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| with the incarceration side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| the jail and the prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| What experience do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| with the incarceration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| side of law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I worked in the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| City Jail for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| When did they close that jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| I don't remember what year it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| but I worked there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| two different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| for a couple of years each stint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| I know the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| What kind of position did you hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| I was a jailer and turnkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| and wagon driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| in my earlier years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| You said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| you retired from KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I assume you're receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| their pension plan right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| If you were to take this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| how would that affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| your pension or would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| it wouldn't affect it except for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| I'd probably have to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| some money back to IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| So you'd be collecting both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| a pension and a salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Are there any other questions for Mr. Presley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Seeing none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| thank you, Mr. Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Is there anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| who would like to speak on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| either one of these candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| or about the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Here he comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Mr. Chairman and County Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| My name is Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| I reside at 8300 Stony View Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Corrie to Tennessee, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| I'm just here on my own behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| and on behalf of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| of the officers of the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| to at least say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| we're in support of Jimmy J.J. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| Back in December, J.J. was appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| as Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| and then things were going great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| at least I thought they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| and then things happened in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| and then all of a sudden, here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Believe me, I'm telling you what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| you get put into a pool like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| and it's an eye-opener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| But let me tell you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| we have a very professional organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| We have a very professional, dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| department for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| and we want to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| We have a lot of things that maybe you're not aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| and I know it's been brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| but what we want to see happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| is to get a sheriff, a full-time sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| We've got memorandums of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| that need to be signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| We've got general orders that we've been holding on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| because we anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| this taking about a 30-day process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| before J.J. or whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| was put back in office, which we were hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| and you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| we've held off on activating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| all these things and we don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2064)|

| 0:35:27| to appoint Jimmy Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Since last January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| when he was appointed the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| we have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2135)|

| 0:35:53| since 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| And to have Tom Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| a man of his character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2159)|

| 0:36:39| made. We have got to get this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| into a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2201)|

| 0:40:23| I'm just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| the advantage that I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| when Tim Hutchison took office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| he hadn't been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| all this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| I had to go down there with Phil Keith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| about three months after he took office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| to try to work out things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| I got down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| and he kind of made Tim look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| We'd go out the door and he told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| about how bad he made Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| I said, yeah you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| I said, let me tell you something son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| You've been doing this for 16, 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| He hadn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| He didn't tell me anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| He just showed me his ignorance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| A guy that hadn't been around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| and worked with policemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| and don't know what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| it's a different world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Policemen are different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| than anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| They've got the sorriest job right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| that could be paid to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| I don't care how much the city, state, or government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| would pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| It's a sorry job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| They're at a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| I can't say nothing to them hardly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| and I'm just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| most of them are going to have a hard job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Any chief or anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| and the chief of police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| at Knoxville right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| has got the best relationship with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| that I saw in my lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| and I've been around I believe a lot longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| than most of y'all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| We're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| I think J.J. would make a fine sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| I don't care who would run against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| J.J.'s got the personality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| and the knowledge to take care of this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| I appreciate y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2516)|

| 0:42:00| Thank you Mr. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| Seeing none, we're going to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| to the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2528)|

| 0:42:20| well, Elena Cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| of 1033 Restwood Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| growing up in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| and was a graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| of South Yonk High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| in 1983| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| and I have worked in this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| for 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| A long political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| thing's not for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| I'm just looking for the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| It's not for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| I'm just looking for the interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| until the clerk comes in in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| I came in under Tommy Lowe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| I worked for Mr. Pagent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| I worked for Mr. Tindall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| and now I'm working for George Sukesbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| All fine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| I have worked in every asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| of this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| I've worked in the marriage license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| in the notary department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| motor vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| and I have worked really close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| with our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| and I would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| like the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| to learn this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| In addition to my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I have a good working relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| with the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| I was an assistant supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| over one of our departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| that was resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| and I believe the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| is progressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| and the process is working smoothly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| The person overseas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| the office keeps that working smoothly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| and there are some instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| that need to be addressed correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| fairly and efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| but I have learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| a lot about the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| over the 24 years that I have been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| and there's a new chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| beginning in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| and I can only hope for the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| because I hope and pray that I will still be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Are there any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| for Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Ms. Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| I think Mr. Chairman you said that there's some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| that need to be addressed fairly and efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| what are those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| It's a difference like I said when it comes to the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I have not been in that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| to be able to come out and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| the numbers and the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| I do know that our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| there's a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| some of our departments they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| self-sustain themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| especially our title department that is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| closely with Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| they are the ones that self-sustain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| they are the ones that we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| pay Nashville, they pay us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| so I mean there's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| different things that need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| the placement of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| and how things are run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| that's the only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| This would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| interim appointment for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I know that there is going to be a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| come September 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| and you said I hope I'm going to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Yes, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| I hope that this would not have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| to do with it, I would hope that they would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| allow me the opportunity to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| and continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| to work there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Knowing that in these fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| there's not what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| civil service protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| it's pretty much employment at will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| and I know that anytime you get into a political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| situation that there's always nervousness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| about being able to keep your job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| or keep your same position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| can you assure us that if you receive this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| appointment that there would not be a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| of reorganization, that there would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| a lot of political fallout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| from your possible appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Yes, I do, because I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| that there needs to be a lot of change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| in our offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| like I said, the employees of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| are the ones that keep it running smoothly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| they are the ones that are out there on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| and they're doing a wonderful job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| in my opinion, I deal with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| very closely over the phone on a day to day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| basis, I see nothing wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| with our office as far as the way it's running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| right now, I'd just like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| like I said, I would just like the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| what is your position now, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| I work in the audit department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| and I work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| the BIS system that was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| recently put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| with George Stooksbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| our clerk now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| like I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| it's the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| department, but I don't deal with money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| it's a different part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| like I said, we deal with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| we issue the titles, we do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| corrections, we process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| the paperwork basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Do you go around to the satellite offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| I have, I've worked in most of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| And how often do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| get to visit those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| That's one of my positions that I have at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| I would like to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I really would, but I have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| like I said, it's more of a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| conversation and it's more I deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| with them on the phone, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| I would really like to be able to go out to the satellite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| offices and see what needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| because it's been a while since I've been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Commissioner Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Same question about budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| how does the staffing of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| clerk's office compare to clerk's offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| of jurisdictions of similar size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| and could you prepare a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| that would include a cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| of either staffing or even up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| 10% of budget? Yes, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| I would be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| I have not dealt with the numbers at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| because I have not been in that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| but I have, there's plenty of employees there that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| dealt with it, I would, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I think that I could sit down and learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| and be able to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Commissioner Luthal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Thank you Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I guess that was going to answer my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| I was going to ask you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| if you're with the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| you've had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| and what you presently have, have you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| much of a chance to work on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| in the clerk's office? No, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| one thing that I have not, that has always been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| held with the Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| Deputy Clerk and the Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| which I have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| appointed and I have never had that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| but I really would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| the opportunity. Have you had any education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| as far as accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| skills or finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| I have one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| but it was more business related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| basically it was, I didn't deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| the numbers, no, unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| Are there any other questions for Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| Seeing none, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=2923)|

| 0:51:42| and would be involved in daily interactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I will search for incentives to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| improve morale and any negativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| that may be in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| In addressing the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| I do have some experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| working with budgets, however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| if chosen, my plan would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| to formulate a team of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| knowledgeable, experienced people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| on that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| and to articulate a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| for submission to the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| In addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| I believe the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| of those seeking the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| of county clerk should be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| when working on a budget to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| under their leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| When working on projects of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| magnitude, we must realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| that none of us is as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| smart as all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Seeking this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| appointment is not the result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| any ill feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| toward Chief Deputy Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Mr. Stukesberry or any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| When I submitted my name for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I was only aware of two additional names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| neither of those being George| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| I am often called on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| when a challenge is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| and I am known for hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| and completion of tasks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Submitting my name for caretaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| of this position was not an easy decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| My concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| my passion for this office should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| clear by your knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| that this came during a difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| in my personal life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| My husband had to undergo major surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| just this week, yet he encouraged me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| to do as I felt led to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| and supports me 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| I want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| you commissioners for considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| me for this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| I appreciate your willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| and I recognize the difficulty in making these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| If chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| I promise to work hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| at incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| toward improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| I am the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| to fill this vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Unless absolutely necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| I would not make any major changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| I think those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| and those decisions should be made by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| person that the citizens of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| County desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| and one that they will elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| Are there any questions for Ms. Ellis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Mr. Hellman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Thank you Ms. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| I just want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I think I heard you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| but I know there are a lot of nervous employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| in the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| 117 strong as I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| You would not use your position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| to make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| to switch things around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Do you want to keep things as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| and maybe work on more efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| and that type of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Yes sir, that is my plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I think major changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| as I said and major decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| should wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| unless absolutely necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| there may be things arise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| that would have to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| but the major issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| the major decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| should wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Do you think you could have more efficiencies in the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| And could you share some of those with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| I would be happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| I just have a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| some might consider these trivial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| but just a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| that I've thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| would be to make random phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| to customers that visited our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| for the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| and find out how they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| get some feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| find out how they were treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| and complete the transaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| that they came in to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| perhaps place comment cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| in each of our offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| and encourage citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| and employees to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| to praise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| to make suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| and look at those periodically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| and another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I think might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| is to implement a recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| and reward program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| that are above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| what they're paid to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| and I think this would spill over with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| because when we have happy employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| that spills over to our service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| to our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| Carol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| thanks for stepping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| and putting yourself out there for this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| do you know what the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| has turned over to Knox County General Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| for this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| and what they've turned over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| in the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| I do not know for this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| I know our total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| receipts increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| last year 8.4%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Knox County receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| increased 7.4%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| the clerks fee account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| increased 10.3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| and the clerks fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| account balance increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| 49.9%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| but we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| but we all know that the clerks office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| uses that money to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| so did the operation cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| go up during that same period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| and what actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| was deposited for the tax payers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| to run county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| you don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I can't answer the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| question in numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| my plan as I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| is to implement a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| to work on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| to work on those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| so that those that might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| better qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| have a knowledge of the past numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| more so than I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| as I said I think as a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| together we can come up with a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| ok thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Commissioner Holliman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| a question about staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| how does our clerks office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| compare to similar jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| in terms of size of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| or some similar yardstick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| such as number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| do you have any data on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| I do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| we are a large staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| we do have more employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| in comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| to other surrounding counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| however you must look at the satellite offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| that we've opened in the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| we've just opened a brand new satellite office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| in the cedar bluff area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| a much needed satellite office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| our customers tell us daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| how much they appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| the satellite offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| that stays open on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| and is open each evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| until 9pm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| that's a convenience to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| citizens that they appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| and of course it takes more staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| to staff those offices that are open out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| did that answer you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| correctly sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner Lutho| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Carol I'll ask you the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| question in any of your past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| positions or present positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| have you had a chance to work with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| in my past position I have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| had a chance to work with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| when I spoke of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| with the budget that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| with my church work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| with the committees that I've worked on as far as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| my position in revenue recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| to explain what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| is I collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| checks for all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| I try to collect those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| and if not I prosecute those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| that we aren't able to collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| and surprisingly enough I hear this everyday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| you mean they write bad checks to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| to the government and yes they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| but I strive to collect those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| but as far as the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| I do not have experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| working on the budget in the county clerks office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| but you have other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| experiences of working with budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| you said with your church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| I do sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| are there other courses that you've taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| that maybe would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| be considered an accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| or finance type of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| that would help you with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| what I've taken is some courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| to enable me in the collection process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| I'm sure that some of those classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| and the education that I've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| would spill over into the financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| department but again as I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| I think a team of supporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| would help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| formulate that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| we're not going to ask the swearing in question today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| no because they don't have anything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Miss Ellis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| I picked up on what you were saying there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| about working with candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| explain that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| I was glad to hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| with working in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| you mentioned that you may want to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| the candidates in doing the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| for us to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| and consider their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| when working with a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| we will only be under that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| for two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| this appointment is temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| be out in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| these people coming into this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| as our leader will be there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| possibly two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| I think it would be important to get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| and consider that heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| another item that you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| and touched on was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| the rewards and recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| I'm very much in favor of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| do you have any ideas or thoughts on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| I think we need to do that in every department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| I was glad to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| I just want to mention two things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| from what I know of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| very good communicator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| and very good with professionalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| you're very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| at what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| was that a question you wanted me to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| yes ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| I think recognition is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| important to our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| and to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| anybody wants to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| good job, great job, doesn't that make us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| want to work harder at what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| and again I think that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| increase our excitement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| at coming into work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| right now that seems to be a little bit low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| and of course that always happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| division happens in offices when there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| is an election year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| the best you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| but I think recognition and reward program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| I saw that at the hospital just this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| they have a star program for their nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| and they have a suggestion box that they ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| people, passers by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| and patients that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| in the hospital to comment on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| I think that's a great way for us to give recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| to our employees and somehow reward them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| for their service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| you know and that goes hand in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| if an employee saves Knox County money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| you know a sizable amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| I think we as an employer need to reward that employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| I mean it's done in the corporate world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| and that just gets people on their toes more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| so I think that's a great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| I totally agree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| are there any other questions for Ms. Ellis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| if not, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3767)|

| 1:03:45| which corresponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| not in as large a degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| but to the county clerk's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3829)|

| 1:04:13| to the commission today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3853)|

| 1:04:17| certain things that correlate with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| the main one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| and this is important to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3863)|

| 1:04:33| and where things are going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| the other thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| keeping the workforce stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| in the office that you're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| having a stable workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| is very very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| if you have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| is going to be impeccable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3887)|

| 1:04:51| the other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| that is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| is what has been said here too many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| is that when things come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| that need taking care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| you need to take care of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| and you need to take care of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| with a gentle glove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| especially to the citizen that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| I think one bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| citizen complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| is worse than 50 good ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| and as people in the business world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| know that it takes you forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| not to recoup that good will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| that you've had for the citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| if one person has gone out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| not feeling they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3925)|

| 1:05:31| I thank you for your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| and I'm open for questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Yes, I notice you work at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Nova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Yes sir, that is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| That's one of our largest employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Yes sir, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| I think right now it's the largest non-public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| employer in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| How many people are under you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| How many people do you supervise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| At the present time, none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| This is a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| self-type position where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| I'm pretty much left alone to do the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| I'm supposed to do and I do it very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Have you managed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| large numbers of employees in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Yes sir, anywhere from 20 to 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| in the public sector it's between 20 and 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I've been under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| my direct supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| You've been the city administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| slash manager for three different cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| Could you tell us why you left those positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Yes sir, once I left on my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| twice I was basically fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| Which is not unusual in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| The general rule of thumb is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| most people will last about two years in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| positions and they either move on or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| they're asked to move on. This is not unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| It's a very volatile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| area for people to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| It's one of the reasons I basically went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| to being in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| is that there was more stability in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| I'll ask you the same question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| I ask the others and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| you have over 100 employees here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| and there is a transition period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| going on in that office as the new clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| will be taking office in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| so can you give assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| mainly to the employees that should you receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| this appointment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| there's not going to be wholesale changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| people moving around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| positions, that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| in other words political things entering in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| No sir, none whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| The thing you want to do for the new person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| whomever it is coming into this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| is not rock the boat so when they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| come in they have a stable office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| that they can take over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| that right now would be the number one priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| Commissioner Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4069)|

| 1:08:09| worked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| In your observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| of the clerk's office right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4093)|

| 1:08:47| years I put in at NOVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| and I just wanted to get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| into a position that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| kind of equal to what my education is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| as they say and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| come up where I don't have to have a full time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| position but a temporary one like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I finished off my working career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| tremendously and that's the reason I did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4145)|

| 1:09:17| will give a different perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| looking at the budget and usually when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| this occurs you find areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4161)|

| 1:09:27| Commissioner Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4167)|

| 1:10:56| let's take government to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| and we've done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| I've been instrumental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| in establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4262)|

| 1:11:18| Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| and I might say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| that all of our dealer work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4282)|

| 1:11:32| service I think to the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4294)|

| 1:11:58| additional revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4318)|

| 1:14:45| How many people does it implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| that we have to have to make these titles now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| We have people in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| that do the Knox County titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| and we have people out in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| halls office that do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| out of county titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| You mean we even make them for out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| county? We do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| How much do we charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| for that and how much does it bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| into the county in additional money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| or does it cost us by the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| of employees we have to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| We get two dollars per title on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| there and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| making money on that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| We are making money. In other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| it's cheaper for us to do it and it's bringing us more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| in instead of relying on the state to do it for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| Yes it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| Mr. Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| George, thanks for stepping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| and putting your name out there once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Same question I asked Carol just a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| How much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| did the clerk's office turn over in I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| the budget year 06-07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| and I think we're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| eight months into the 07-08| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Do you know what's actually been deposited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| into the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Yes I do. We've turned over at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| $400,000 for this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| and as you well know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| November, December, January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| time frame is probably some of our slowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| We're getting ready to pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| into some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| larger months which we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| probably be able to turn in more money to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| county and in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| two years I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| we've turned in about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| $1.3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| in excess fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| Pardon me, what was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| 1.3 million figure again? That was for what time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| That was for 06-07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| I've got one more question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| What is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| I guess the total operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| cost per month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| and that's including your rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| and your employees salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| We're probably about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| a half million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| Okay, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| Commissioner Ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| George, appreciate you coming here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| One thing that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Carol Ellis said and I'm curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| is that the fund for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| clerk's office grew 49%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| What type of account is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| and what does that go for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| That's our year end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| fees in which she was alluding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| that the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| was in that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| and that's a total of all our cash receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| and disbursements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| and that was a balance as of end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| June of 07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| So is a lot of that based on then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| I guess sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| of cars in Knoxville I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| and the title work that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| That covers everything from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| registrations, our titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| marriage license, business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| mobile homes, it encompasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Would part of that be due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| the will tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Yes it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| And you know at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| on the will tax increase we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| 12 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| going into the budget or being collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| and there's some administrative costs and fees for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| Do you know what the true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| figure is that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| into the Knox County budget from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| We turned in about 11 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| other questions for Mr. Stooksbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| George| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| if you tell me more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| like what Ms. Ellis talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| on the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| trying to reward them or recognize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| as of three weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| we sent out a letter to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| our managers to establish a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| We have not yet set down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| and I think it's a good idea when I was in service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| and I can speak to that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| we had a program where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| rewarded people for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| the county I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| has a program like that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| but we would certainly like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| with people that have suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| it would be a great idea for employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| if we could establish something like that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| I don't know that we could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| from our office monetary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| but you know it would certainly be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| if this commission would look at something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| Are there any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Thank you Mr. Stooksbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4757)|

| 1:19:53| I think most of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4793)|

| 1:19:57| my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4797)|

| 1:20:01| on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| I retired from Blue Cross and Blue Shield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| in a manager position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4805)|

| 1:20:39| addendum I guess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| I'll probably get some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| on this but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4843)|

| 1:20:55| items or initiatives were started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| prior to my leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| very frankly I don't think some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| would be on there or in the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| today if I had not been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| and that was accomplished in 8 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| which I'm very proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| like you've heard before me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| there's a lot of great employees in the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| and these are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| things that I did solely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| it was in conjunction with the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| all in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| you have a good office over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| and I guess I made the statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| in my letter that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| my coming to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| is simply I'd like to finish the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| 8 months over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| was I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| we accomplished a lot there were some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| made in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| I don't plan to do anything if I go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| in in possibly 6 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| any major changes other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| to follow some of these initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| to the conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| and that will be a better office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| for whoever is elected in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| Any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| for Mr. Tindall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| You took away the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| employees parking where they just pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| themselves is that what this says here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| I think it needs to be uniform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| all the way across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| I have a comment for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| in the January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| the appointments that we did there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| I didn't vote for you to go for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| but I made a comment out in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| 3 or 4 months after you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| took office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| of the people office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| that we appointed to positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| you really just jumped in and did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| quite a few things and I wanted to compliment you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| on what you did do during that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| in office that you were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| I was impressed with what you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| and how you tried to save the taxpayers some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Billy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Commissioner I appreciate you saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| Well Commissioner Tindall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| you know you called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| about the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| and soliciting my vote like all the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| and you know I told you that I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| the clerks office should be turning in more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| to the county than what they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| and I asked you to go down there and see if you couldn't find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| some things wrong where you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| help the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| I think you've done a good job there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| while you were there from what I've heard from other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| like Commissioner Smith said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| on one thing here you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| you've reduced the total number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| by 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| February 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| to October 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| that's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| and the other thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| from what these people are working down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| everything is going right along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| real smooth right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| so apparently those people weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| needed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| and I hate to see anybody lose their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| but another thing I would like to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| you abolished two genitorial positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| and saved the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| about $45,000 annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| you've got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| is that including those 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| some people were transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| like when we opened the office here in the courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| and brought driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| and passports up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| we used existing employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| so we kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| you could take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| those two are gone there's no question about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| but we have hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| we hired a few people not many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| but the net effect was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| we had 5 less employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| some were let go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| when I first came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| does that answer your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| basically that's answering it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| but what I want to say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| I hate to see anybody lose their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| but if we've got more people working in this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| than we really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| then you hate to say it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| we have to cut the fat out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| especially with this upcoming year budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| I think one of the other candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| you've got 7 locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| 6 satellite offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| one of them has 2 shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| at the center mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| they've got a day shift and night shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| and also on Saturdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| in order to handle the peak periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| which is right around the first of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| you've got to have ample employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| let me say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| I know you asked George| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| or one of the candidates here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| about if we lost any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| on a certain line of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| and I forget what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| but we do lose money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| on driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| pays us $2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| basically for each renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| there's a $4 thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| if you lose your renewal application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| but basically we lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| $2,000 last year on driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| now that's a great service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| for the people in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| because I've had many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| tell me they go to the 2 state places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| one Straw Plains and one down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| Pellissippi I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| and they wait anywhere from an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| to I've heard 4 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| to get their driver's license renewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| doesn't make a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| to me about the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| to have that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| set up but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| we do lose that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| now here's the other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| the west office was opened up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| October I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| probably November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| I went down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| I can't remember what month it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| after I left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| the new west office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| does not have driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| a lot of people don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| that you can't just put driver's license down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| even though we've got them at halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| center mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| and also at five points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| we have to have a state approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| from the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| of Safety to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| and they've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| policy over there now they're not expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| that across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| in fact there's only 33 counties out of 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| renew driver's license for the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| and we're one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| we're probably the largest one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| I think Davidson County got one approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| I got one approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| we got one approved in courthouse here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| this year as you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| when we opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| and we applied for one for west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| and it was turned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| we even had our two senators and a couple of representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| helping us on that and they still turn us down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| that they did approve one for Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| this year but they didn't do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| they had no driver's license renewals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| it's a complicated process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| but I'll tell you this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| if I'm appointed to this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| that'll be one of my first priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| try to get one down west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| it'll make a big difference in the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| the people down there have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| everything that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| in the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| you know these satellite offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| are a great convenience for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| but has anybody ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| took a study to see whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| these offices are costing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| the county money or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| making us money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| now you understand I'm a commissioner up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| and if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| wasn't for me being on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| I would never have to come to this courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| plus also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| everything that you're furnishing the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| they can't get it anywhere but here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| so it may save us money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| but not having these satellite offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| I'd just like to know if they're making money or costing us money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| we cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| build something right next door to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| every citizen in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| without having tax increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| and paying for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| sometimes you have to be inconvenienced for some of these services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| and I'd just like to know if there's ever been a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| I probably should have asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| George this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| whether these satellite offices are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| making us money or costing us money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| that's a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| we've looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| we looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| there's a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| on the border| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| I think in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| you'll probably have maybe three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| super centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| as satellites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| in my estimation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| I wouldn't want to do it immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| but later on you probably could have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| like Cedar Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| which does the majority of the business now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| you could have one here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| and the new west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| which should turn out to be the size of Cedar Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| I think that would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| you'd have one on that end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| one on this end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| and one in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| well then what you're saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| with this upcoming budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| you'd be willing to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| those satellite offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| and if there's a way we can save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| you'd be more interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| in opening up in Westtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| well I'd be willing to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| I'd tell you you're going to have a fight on your hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| oh I know you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| people get spoiled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| I know exactly what you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| for one inconvenience a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| maybe one inconvenience every five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| there's not going to be that many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| disappointed if we can save them on their tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| well I can't quote you the figures today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| but the south office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| we pay no rent or lease out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| there's only a couple employees out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| so I'd say we're doing alright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| with that I don't know who furnishes us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| that free rent but we appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| well I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| now this is hearsay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| I didn't read it in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| either but anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| I've heard that some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| work is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| shipped out of the main courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| to these satellite offices to give these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| let me just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| this Paul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| we set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| as you read my resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| we set up a dealer department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| at center mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| that's when we moved the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| Jim Gray and the computer people out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| and had the room out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| we moved that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| and it was a great success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| still is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| I think George mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| the west office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| we've also split that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| the west is probably getting the majority of that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| so we have two dealer departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| now and that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| and I guess to answer your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| if some of those comes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| the courthouse up here for three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| they'll probably go ahead and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| they bring a stack of them in they'll ship them down to west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| or center mall they'll be done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| be processed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| that's correct most of these car dealers have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| carriers to bring their tile work up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| so why should we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| West Knoxville if that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| most of the work is coming from when they're going to bring it up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| you have the employees up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| to do this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| I think most of them west will send them west now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| they've been taking them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| center mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| I understand they'll send it west because if I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| a carrier for them I'd go to the shortest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| place too but what I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| they bring that work in and leave it is that not correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| we've also got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| carriers that will take them west for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| but we just need to look at saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| the people all the money we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| businesses in the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| sector have got that figured into the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| of their cars when they sell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| I understand what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| it works pretty good it works better than it did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| before put it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| it's more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| follow up question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| ties in a little bit with what you're talking about there Paul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| those are some good comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| I'm going to go back to this parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| that you talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| that you wanted had the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| all the employees are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| paying for their parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| and I think that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| across the board what was your thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| there how was it perceived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| how did the employees take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| well there was only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| I can't tell you how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| now maybe 12 or 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| not every employee had that privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| it was mostly the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| that had to travel to the satellites a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| and that type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| of thing so it wasn't all the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| just a very few 10% maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| I don't know how they perceived it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| mainly the reason we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| stopped that is because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| the talk we heard and also when we had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| audit I think I mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| on the end that we had an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| the Rotter for you remember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| now all the officers really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| and we had 20 or so findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| and recommendations one of them was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| they recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| that we stop it and we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| and I agree with that people that work here full time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| I think need to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| for the parking I mean it's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| $30 and right next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| it's $90 it's a bargain as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| and if a fee office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| the employees are paying that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| or the tax payers are paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| that money for the employees to park for free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| I don't think that's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| I think it should be across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| everybody in Knox County you work here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| 8 to 5 you need to be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| to park because otherwise the tax payers are paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| for that and who pays for the tax payers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| parking where they work I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| that's right and I'll be looking at that during budget time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| so we stopped it in the clerks office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| I just want to know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| the employees took it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| I didn't hear any really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| it comes down to about a dollar and a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| we didn't have 100 employees that we were paying for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| I don't like to say it's about 10 or 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| as I recall some number like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| it comes out about a dollar and a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| a day or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| and of course you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| multiply that by 30 bucks I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you Mr. Chairman, Billy thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| the improvements that you made to the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| you've listed 12 concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| things and I know that I have reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| the road from us and the findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| you did little things even like instituting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| a cell phone policy which you didn't have before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| so those are all positive things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| and all things that you're to be congratulated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| I guess my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| you and I had met shortly after you took office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| and you were telling me about some of the things that you wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| thought that was a pretty ambitious program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| but you were able to accomplish a lot of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| but one of the things was about the credit cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| and I guess I was surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| that I didn't know that the clerks office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| in 2006, 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| with all of the automation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| and with everything we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| you set up credit cards and you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| kind of an antiquated system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| would you address that as to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| it took so long to get that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| that's an interesting story really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| particularly for a guy coming in new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| and it hit me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| fairly early because you were over fairly early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| eight months as I recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| you heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| from Carol Ellis here many ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| she works mainly with bad checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| I think she told you, I couldn't hear her back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| Carol, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| brought her into the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| we were talking about the bad check problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| to make a long story short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| she said well if we had credit cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| I think that would cut that down or help that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| so I asked her to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| to look at that and see what we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| because I know they had tried it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| I think Mr. Padgett had tried it before a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| and so it ended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| we bid it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| and we got our IT department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| involved in that obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| and we had a couple of bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| that came back we just weren't satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| with them mainly because of Visa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| Visa's got a real tight contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| with the people they deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| and we could not get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| relief from any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| liability so to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| so we turned those down and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| another employer there, Michael Pursuer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| had been talking to a company called BIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| they brought that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| and we had our IT people look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| the law department looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| the contract was good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| we brought it to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| you heard it's being implemented right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| that's how that came about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| really a great addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| if you look at the bookkeeping system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| I call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| 19th century I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| or 20th century whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| but this is really going to modernize that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| and work in real well and get everything on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| be a great for inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| automatic inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| I think George mentioned some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| that was a good move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| I appreciate your interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| in coming over and asking about these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| I know we had a long talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| Billy I want to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| look at these figures here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| you've done a great job for what time you were over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| and I don't want you to misunderstand me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| about these satellite offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| we still have to have the number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| if we have the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| you can't eliminate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| but we might have to bring some of them back up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| because we do have light bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| and things like that in these offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| and rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| factors like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| and I know we can't cut the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| but it might be cheaper on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| to bring them back up here to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| is what I was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5925)|

| 1:38:52| I looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| and I'll look at it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| if I'm reappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| I know I can get some figures now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| through this new system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| I couldn't get before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5942)|

| 1:39:06| and she assured me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| I could now get those figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| I asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=5950)|

| 1:43:39| and wanted to close that office out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| I disagreed with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| very strongly about closing that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| because I had just done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6226)|
