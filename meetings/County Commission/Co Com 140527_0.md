| 0:00:38| please? May we all stand, face the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=38)|
| 0:00:47| States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=47)|
| 0:00:54| with liberty and justice for all. I want you to approve the minutes from the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=54)|
| 0:01:05| Is there a motion? So moved. Second. We have a first and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it. Mr. Law Director, will you swear any individuals that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| plan to testify? Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. If you're here today to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=74)|
| 0:01:21| to testify before this, the Knox County Beer Board, please stand, raise your right hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| and be sworn in. Do you solemnly swear and affirm the testimony you're about to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| in this matter shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| you God? I do. Thank you. Be seated. Mr. Chairman, you're sworn in. First item, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| Clerk. Consideration of suspension and revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| Ken Joe Incorporated, number 21, 8901 Oak Ridge Highway. Ken Joe Incorporated, owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| first offense. Good afternoon. Would you please state your name for the record and the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=116)|
| 0:02:09| address for which you represent? Wes Carruthers, Ken Joe Incorporated. The procedure here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=129)|
| 0:02:16| is that there will be some allegations brought before your company, and then after the allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=136)|
| 0:02:25| are stated, you will have an opportunity to give your side, to take testimony, to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| anything you would like to say before this board. The board then will take it under their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| deliberation, and at which time they will have a finding. So at this time, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| to call the Sheriff's Department, Captain Wolfie May. On 4-24-14, I conducted an underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=160)|
| 0:02:53| beer sting, Ken Joe Shale, 8901 Oak Ridge Highway, and purchased a six-pack Bud Eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| You have heard the allegations. Do you deny or affirm? We affirm. Okay. At this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=181)|
| 0:03:14| you can give any testimony or anything you'd like to say before this board. Okay. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| just like to go through some of the procedures that we put in place to try to prevent this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| We take it very seriously. We have several different steps that we follow when an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| is hired. They are trained by the manager at that point. They also take part in an online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| training course that they must pass a test at 100% before we ever allow them to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| the first day. At that initial orientation, there's also paperwork that explains all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| rules and regulations that they sign and say they understand, which we have. After| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| that step, sometime within the first 60 days, we actually bring every new hire into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| central office and we conduct another training program for about six and a half hours. About| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| half of that is dedicated to alcohol and tobacco training. This individual did attend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| training, signed another form that he understood all the laws and regulations with that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| we give them another test at that time, a handwritten test that they have to pass, which he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| After that step, we actually hire a third-party company that we have do compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| at all of our locations in Knox County. He conducts those every month. We have a zero-tolerance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| policy, whether it was from the police department or within our own. If anybody's caught violating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=277)|
| 0:04:45| the laws on that, then it's grounds for immediate termination. This individual was terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=285)|
| 0:04:55| immediately. The last thing we do is, on a daily basis, to try to remind these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| that work with us to follow the laws. Every day that they work, we have an alcohol awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| forum that, again, reiterates all of the laws and the rules, and they initial that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| every day before they clock in, stating that they will follow the rules. This individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| did initial the day that he worked. I would like to say that our central training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| that we do, this individual actually came to that training program the very day before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| he sold the beer. He was trained. We do have the receipt from where he rang it up. He entered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| a birth date of 3-13, and I think the ID was 8-13, so I don't know if he made a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| or if he just didn't care. But he knew the rules. Thank you. Do you have anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| to say before I turn it over to the chairman? No, sir. Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Crowder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| that's my district, and normally, as a district, we try to make those recommendations. In light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| of your . . . normally, the first offense is a $500 fine, and in light of your all-aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| training program and aggressive preparedness, I'm going to recommend a $250 fine or a 15-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| suspension instead of the $500 fine. That will be my motion. Second. Commissioner Olenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=377)|
| 0:06:27| You answered part of the question that he did look at the ID and he did punch it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| He did. We actually have a copy of the receipt. It shows the date that's checked and entered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| Did he give an explanation why? I mean . . . He said that he made a mistake. That he misread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| it? It was, I think, the birth date, and you can maybe clarify. It was 8-13, and he put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| in 3-13. I said it last month, and I'll say it again. I don't like the point of terminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| somebody on the first offense. I just . . . To me, that is just too extreme. People do make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=415)|
| 0:07:05| mistakes. People type in the wrong thing. They look at the ID, and a 3 could look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| an 8, or an 8 could look like a 3 when they're looking at it, but I will be in favor for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| the fine, but I'm just . . . I think termination is a little extreme on a first offense, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=435)|
| 0:07:25| Any other questions for Commissioner McKenzie? Thank you, Mr. Chair. I agree that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| the 6th District, and I also agree with Commissioner Olmey. I think first offenses are, while very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| unfortunate, I'm not a zero-tolerance guy. I'm just really not, but with that said, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| struggle with us reducing the fine. We've had other very reputable companies, entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=468)|
| 0:07:59| come in here, and they've shown true remorse. They've stepped up. They've owned the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=479)|
| 0:08:08| They've created solutions. They've been creative in developing their solutions, and we've still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| kept that fine at the prescribed level, at the set first offense level. So I struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=494)|
| 0:08:23| with us changing a process that I don't think I've ever voted on a reduced fine for a first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| offense, and I just can't in good conscience do that at this point for this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=510)|
| 0:08:37| company, simply because we haven't done it in the past. But some people have done, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| think, greater steps than Kenjo Markets. So I'm going to introduce a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=522)|
| 0:08:52| that we keep the fine at $500. Second. We have a first and a second. I will state the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=532)|
| 0:09:02| reason. Historically, the raceway on Oak Ridge Highway got a letter on their first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| and that really didn't work out very well for Raceway or Knox County. So that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| reason of my thinking. I appreciate your comments. Commissioner Smith. Sam, I'm in some agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| with you on this, and sir, you do a lot for the community, and we appreciate that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| I sort of fall back on what Sam just says. A lot of people come before very reputable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| companies, and they have the same problem, and I just don't feel like we need to be changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| horses here doing that. We have a substitute motion on the floor, which is a $500 fining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=581)|
| 0:09:50| or a 30-day suspension. I assume the 30-day was on the option there, Sam. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| say aye. Aye. Opposed? No. Let's do a roll call vote, please. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| Commissioner McKenzie. Aye. Commissioner McKenzie votes aye. Commissioner Broyles. Aye. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| Broyles votes aye. Commissioner Norman. Aye. Commissioner Norman votes aye. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| Owenby. No. Commissioner Owenby votes no. Commissioner Briggs. Aye. Commissioner Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| votes aye. Commissioner Anders. No. Commissioner Anders votes no. Commissioner Smith. Aye. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| Smith votes aye. Commissioner Wright. Aye. Commissioner Wright votes aye. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| Brown. Aye. Commissioner Brown votes aye. Commissioner Hammond. No. Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| votes no. Commissioner Shouse. No. Commissioner Shouse votes no. 7-4. All right, the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=634)|
| 0:10:44| passes 7-4, so there will be a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension. I assume the fine? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| You have seven days to pay the clerk's office. Okay, thank you. Thank you. 5B, Lee's Food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| Mart, No. 124-7657 Clinton Highway, Lee Enterprises, Inc., owner of First Defense. Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=658)|
| 0:11:12| Would you please state your name and the address of your business, please? My name is Tim Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| I'm the district manager for Lee's Food Mart. This is regarding Lee's Food Mart 124-7657| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| Clinton Highway. All right, thank you. You've seen the procedures here today. I'll be calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| the Sheriff's Department for the allegations against you. Then you will have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| to affirm or deny and present your side. Yes, sir. Captain May, please. On 4-24-2014, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=693)|
| 0:11:41| conducted an underage beer sting, Lee's Food Mart, 7657 Clinton Highway, and purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=701)|
| 0:11:55| a 25-ounce can of Bud Light. Okay, you heard the allegations from the officer. Do you admit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| or deny? We admit it. Okay. Do you have any testimony that you'd like to give before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=723)|
| 0:12:12| body before they examine your case? Yes, sir, I do. It is unfortunate that it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| It's not Lee's Food Mart's desires whatsoever to sell alcohol or tobacco to anybody underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=737)|
| 0:12:26| When we hire people, we do have a training program with them. They work with the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| manager and assistant manager. They have documentation that they sign saying that they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| that we do not sell to underage. In fact, our cash registers, when you scan tobacco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| or alcohol, either one, it requires a birth date. This cashier put in his birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=759)|
| 0:12:47| He checked the ID according to the video and keyed in his own birth date, which I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| have a reason for. We terminate him that very same day. It's just not good business. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=775)|
| 0:13:06| don't want to do that. We have no desire to do that. It's just a slippery slope. If they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| do it once, I don't feel comfortable letting them stay because they may do it again. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| really all I have. We hire them, we train them, they work with people, and we just try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| our best that we have good employees. For the most part, we do. Unfortunately, somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| didn't do what they were supposed to do. Mr. Chairman? I believe that's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| I'll make a motion for a $500 fine and 30-day suspension. I need a second, I guess. My question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=822)|
| 0:13:51| is, did they check ID? Did he check the ID, did you say? He did check his ID. But he falsified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| the punch-in? Yes. Go ahead. He also advised me that he had not been to TIPS class and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| he'd worked there three months. Okay, thank you. Commissioner Olinby? Yeah, as I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| before and you heard, I don't condone firing on a first offense, but this one, working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=854)|
| 0:14:22| in the convenience store business like I did for so many years, someone that punches in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| their own ID means that they're going to sell it anyway. They just didn't really look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| the ID. They took it only for the camera's purposes. That's the way I felt about it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| I'm sorry he did that, but I'm not a, like Sam said before, a no-tolerance, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=877)|
| 0:14:46| certain circumstances that when you start punching in your own, it does concern me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| he said he hasn't been to TIPS class. Is that true? He hadn't worked there for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=893)|

| 0:15:04| Okay, but he hadn't had TIPS training? He hasn't had TIPS yet, but we have, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| 90 days, I believe. And I'm more than happy to send everybody in that store to the TIPS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| class, you know, the next available opening. This is just a suggestion from my standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| I know you have 90 days to do it, but I would suggest doing it in the first couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| if they're hired. I mean, it gets it out of the way, it lets them know, and then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| way they can't use that as an excuse of why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Ma'am, can we have your name for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I'm Joni Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Joni Miller, and it's 60 days, I believe, on TIPS, so you need to, that's 60 days is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| the day you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Either way, we'll still take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| All right, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair. You're not the first one who has come up with this same story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| the fact that, well, they've only been there a certain amount of time. I know that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| have 60 days to get that done, but if you're selling a lot of beer, it should be in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| best benefit to, after the first week, I mean, you're going to kind of know whether that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| person is going to work out or not. They need to have some on-the-job or some kind of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| to get things started, and they need to be in that TIPS program or some program within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| the first two weeks, in my opinion. I mean, that's for what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| It's worth $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| We have a motion and a second. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=993)|

| 0:16:40| you can take a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1000)|

| 0:16:46| 5C, Shell Gas Station 7135 Clinton Highway, Deva Corporation, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1006)|
| 0:16:55| Good afternoon, sir. Will you state your name and address your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Don Patel, Deva Corporation, Shell Gas Station 7135 Clinton Highway, and I own the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| You've heard the procedure today. At this time, I'll call Captain Wolfie May. He will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| make some statements and allegations, at which time, afterward, you'll have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| to refute or deny and to tell your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| I admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| OK, thank you. He agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| On 4-24-14, send an underage into the Shell Mart 7135 Clinton Highway and purchase a 16-ounce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1047)|
| 0:17:38| red apple ale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| You heard the allegations. Do you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| OK. Do you have any testimony you'd like to give before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| Yeah, the boy I hired three months ago, and it was my mistake. I didn't send him to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| task class. So now I decide to any employer I hire, I have to send them task class before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| I have to give them to the responsibility. Plus, I hired in a second shift two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| in that shift, because the second shift I hired, I just keep the one employer. And sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| was busy, and the weekend always busy, so now I hired two people. So both people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| check the ID. Plus, I had a Ruby system, and it was my mistake. It's not an upgrade system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| So now I did the upgrade system to every customer. By the alcohol, they have to punch the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| on the register. And if the guy is underage, the register don't going to allow to the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| So that's where they can find out whoever person going to buy the beer, he's underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| Plus, who the guy sold the beer, I send him the class, and he finish the class. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| don't fire him, because he did mistake, but we are be careful he don't going to mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| again. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to make a motion for a $500 fine or a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| suspension. Second. All right. Is there any questions? Any comments? All right. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it. Sir, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| have seven days to either pay the clerk a $500 fine or take a 30-day suspension of your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1165)|

| 0:19:58| custody and can't be here today, so I can't present anything, and I would ask to pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| until next month so we can at least be heard. I think that's probably the only real fair way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| I'll make a motion that we postpone, Mr. Shope, but you also have to understand that we'll hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| that license and that store is to remain closed for beer sales anyway until he comes back before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| this board. It'll be a suspension or revocation hearing, and my motion's going to be revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| The whole store's closed right now anyway because he's on what runs it, and he's in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| If he is bonded out, he is not to sell beer. We're going to hold his permit. I'll tell him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| We have a motion and a second for deferral and a holding of the beer permit until the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=1243)|

| 0:48:02| We had some questions for Dr. McIntyre on this last week, and I guess I'd like to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| along the lines of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| Dr. McIntyre, do you care to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2901)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Last week we were talking about Pearson, and I think you had some numbers possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| for this in terms of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Do you still have those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| We estimated that the cost of this contract would be in the neighborhood of about $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| What portion of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| Is this related to the reading program that the mayor has supported in his budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2951)|
| 0:49:20| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Is it related to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| It's not related to kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| Is it related to kindergarten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| To some evaluation of kindergarten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Are you talking about the SAT-10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| Is it related to SAT-10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I guess just to describe it, what does it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| What does a contract do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Well, as we talked about last week, this is an assessment tool that helps us to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| state mandate of response to instruction and intervention, RTI squared, which is an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| to provide intervention and support services to students in the regular education setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| prior to any identification of students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| And is this the same contract that basically last year, $250,000, was devoted to this last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3013)|
| 0:50:23| So the contract that we have for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| that we're putting in place here has two different vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| And so two different potential tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| What we've been using is the Pearson product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| It's called AIMSweb to do these assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Again, this is a requirement from the Tennessee Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Renaissance Learning offers a different product, which may allow us to do both some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| benchmark assessments, but also give us some formative information about how our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| are doing so that it can serve dual purposes and potentially eliminate the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| For right now, we're using AIMSweb as the benchmarking tool, and we're using Discovery Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| as a formative assessment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Renaissance has components of both of those that may allow us to utilize only one assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| instead of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Could you give me an example of a benchmarking assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| So we do the benchmarking on a periodic basis, I believe it's three times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| to identify where our students are and to see if they need intervention or support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| particularly in literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| But like an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| So where they are, give me a grade, give me a, you know, is it a reading assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| So give me an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Second grade reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Second grade reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| And what would be a benchmark for second grade reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| What would be a benchmark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| I'm not sure I understand your question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| Well, how would you classify, I mean, how would you define the benchmark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| What would the benchmark be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Are we reading at second grade reading level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| That's a benchmark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| So we look at students who are in the 10th to 25th percentile in terms of essentially national norms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3127)|
| 0:52:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| How long, somewhere I think I saw that in some article that you only plan on using this program through September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Which program was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| I'm sorry, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Which program was it you were knocking off in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| I couldn't hear your question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| Which program is it you are discontinuing in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| Oh, well, we had talked about there's another item on the agenda for the Gallup tool that we might consider discontinuing in September or October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3173)|
| 0:53:04| You said this one here was going to be $250,000, which is what you said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| But yet when you run the numbers out on the contract, it comes out to a million and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| That's a lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| I don't know where the million and a half figure that you're citing is coming from, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| We estimate that this contract may cost about $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3202)|
| 0:53:32| It ain't modern math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| I asked for a list of how much you all are spending on testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| Is that ready yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I believe we provided that to you last week, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| I haven't gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| I believe we forwarded that to you last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| It must be somewhere in the pipeline then because I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| Again, as I said last week, you said this was state mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| But yet it wasn't on the list that I have that showed you the list of state mandated tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| Commissioner, I can only tell you what I know, that this is part of the requirement from the Tennessee Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3257)|
| 0:54:27| I can't speak to the veracity of the sources that you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| The chart that was passed out to us at the joint meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| the graph showing us last and purporting us to be last in the state per pupil expenditure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3276)|
| 0:54:45| did that come from your office or Mr. Harris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| I don't think you were given something that said we were last in the state in per pupil expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Well, that's what it inferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| I'd just like to know who's snowing us so I can kind of keep my eyes open a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| Somebody's pulling a snow job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| Commissioner, the document that Mr. Harris provided to you at the joint school board commission meeting was a document that Mr. Harris prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3307)|
| 0:55:18| But yet we are 11th out of 130 systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| Commissioner Brown, I'm going to stop you because we're off this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| We need to keep our focus on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| So, if you have any questions relative to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| We're both figuring it different ways, that's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Commissioner Norman, are you through or do you have more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| We have a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| How many no's do we have? Raise your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| O-1-B and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| On page 6, Resolution 211, approving an agreement with Gallup Bank in the amount of $64,503 to provide and maintain all hardware, software, programming, and research for web-based teacher inter-site and principal inter-site interviews for the term beginning June 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3358)|
| 0:56:25| Through May 31, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Resolution 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| I'm going to make a request to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| It may not have been clear last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| I think with the consent decree that's on file, that's part of record, which is duty-bound at this point to stand by, we can't vote these things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3404)|
| 0:56:58| So now that we're starting to get more and more no votes, I'm beginning to get a bit concerned if we get to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3418)|
| 0:57:09| If we get to six, then we're going to be kind of in no man's land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| We've got a new commission coming on board a few months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| So I'm going to ask the law department if they would potentially put something else before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| These are consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I don't know why we're voting on consent items individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| That's my concern, is that one day we're going to end up with a 6-5 vote down on a consent item, and then we're going to start spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3457)|
| 0:57:48| And I really don't want to start spending money in terms of having lawyers get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| So I'm asking the law department if we can – I don't know if this is a spread of record, if this – we can question these as long as the day is long, but we kind of vote as a block on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3474)|
| 0:58:06| I just think we're getting – and these are great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| I don't want to stop the questioning of the superintendent and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| That is not what Commissioner McKenzie wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| He thinks this is a very good dialogue, but these votes concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| That's my only issue, is these votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| We cannot vote these down, to my knowledge, to my recollection, to my reading of the consent decree, the consent decision that was passed down, I guess, early on under Ragsdale administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3501)|
| 0:58:35| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| In addressing Commissioner McKenzie's concern, once these items are voted on by the school board, these contract items that are in their budget, they're automatically executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3520)|
| 0:58:57| Whether you pass a resolution or do not pass a resolution, the resolution would not go to the mayor, but the contract from the school board would go to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3537)|
| 0:59:08| However you vote, because it is ministerial, if it is in their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| If it needs a match by statute, then you have the right to vote it up or vote it down, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| So, if it's brought here to this body and you do not put it on the consent, you can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3561)|
| 0:59:33| The vote, like I said, is whether the resolution passes, not whether the contract is effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| The contract is effective once the school board votes on it, and it becomes a part of their minutes if it's in their budget and it's already been approved by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3578)|
| 0:59:47| The rest of it is for you all to inquire for future funding, to understand how the school boards are doing, whatever it is, and you have a right to ask the questions, have the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3587)|
| 0:59:59| But once you put it on consent from the workshop, you cannot pull it off consent from the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| And that's the legal position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Just because this is taking a lot of time, it's become controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Do we need to be handling these in a different manner on the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| I think we need to refer this to the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| Right now, we don't have one of our own commission rules on how to handle it, but would that be appropriate or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| I think it would be, and then we can do it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| And then if there's questions about it, and I think the questions are all legitimate, but it seems like if those were addressed at the school board meetings rather than here, because that is the place where something could be done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3635)|
| 1:00:49| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I realize, like I said last week, that it is a moot point that these are already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| But what I want is some vehicle to get these items being able to be discussed at this open meeting where Knox County is watching, other than just at the school board meetings, so they know what they're spending their tax dollars for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3658)|
| 1:01:16| So if there's a way to say, okay, when something comes through like this, there needs to be some explanation and dollar figures attached to it, whatever it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3676)|
| 1:01:26| I want to be able to discuss these things at this meeting as far as what they are doing with it and what it's going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| I think what we had decided two years ago, I think when Commissioner Hammond was the chairman, is that I think, and Sam, correct me if I'm wrong, is that we discussed them at the workshop and then consented to them in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3694)|
| 1:01:46| I agree, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| I think that was where the understanding was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| These two items did not come on the consent agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| Because they were voted against in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| That comment was made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| The questions were supposed to be asked in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| I think that was what the agreement was a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Okay, any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3729)|

| 1:02:29| Can we move that to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| Yeah, it should have been moved down on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| I think I can just move it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3755)|
| 1:02:54| We're going to go ahead and go over the ordinances and then we'll come back to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3774)|
| 1:03:05| Yeah, 908, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3785)|

| 1:05:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Are there any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| I'd like to hear from the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Mr. Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Thank you for this opportunity, Foster Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| I'm your Knox County Clerk, 4636 Altavista Way here in Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| Basically, we have gotten a lot of complaints from people who are saying people are coming to their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| They have no identification, no solicitor's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| I think Chairman Andrews and I were talking the other day where there was a homicide committed in the county about 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| And we've got people coming in from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| They're not getting any kind of a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| They're not doing anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| They're just going out and knocking on doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| I had a couple come to my house about two months ago at 930 at night and knock on my door and want to solicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| And I said, where's your permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| And they said, we don't have to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| And I said, well, I'm the Knox County Clerk, and yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| And they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| So what we've done is we've tried to make this fair across the board so that everybody that comes in has a solicitor's permit that Sheriff Jones can do their background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3965)|
| 1:06:17| and we can have a record of who they are and just make it fair across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| So I brought with me Daniel Wolfenbarger, who is our expert, who does this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| So if you have any technical questions, Daniel would be much better than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Daniel, explain who this – what businesses – I mean, is it just homes we're talking about, or is it homes and commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| And who's – is anybody – tell us, give us the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| It's mainly just homes is what we've had complaints on in the last probably few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| And certain businesses are saying that they do not have to have a permit, but also some businesses do have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| And it's just – it's been – more and more complaints have been coming on for the last couple months for certain companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| and it's just trying to make it fair all the way across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| I mean, I know what's going on in the subdivisions, and I hear some of that too, people selling security systems and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| But I'm looking – a man wanting to sell – people call me all the time wanting to sell copy machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| I sell insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Does that pertain – people wanting to do – clean your buildings, does that pertain to any of that posture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| If they call you on the phone or send something out to you or stick it in your newspaper tube –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| and I hope I'm not doing anything new, something they wouldn't want me to do –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| but this is when they come and knock on your door and actually talk to you face-to-face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| But at the home, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Commissioner Brown, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Does this preclude a life insurance salesman from going door-to-door selling life insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| He'd just have to have the proper licensure, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| He's licensed with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| He's going to have to come and get a permit to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| If he's got business in Knox County, he's supposed to have a business license in Knox County, and then to go door-to-door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| If you approve this ordinance, now you all can approve this, reject it, modify it, whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| But if this passes, then they will have to have a solicitor's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| What if they work for a national company who has a local office here and they have a state license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4102)|
| 1:08:32| Each individual, as Commissioner Smith knows, each individual agent has to have a state license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| Are they going to have to have a permit also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| If you all pass this ordinance, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| That would only pertain to a cold, for lack of a better term, a cold call on a door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| So if he's in a subdivision, if he calls and says, hey, can I come meet with you, it doesn't pertain to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| But if he's just walking the neighborhood and knocks on the door, he has to come meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| And this does not in any way preclude 501c3s or church organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| They do not have to be licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| Well, there's still a lot of insurance agents, whether it's life insurance or health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| coming out of that industry that do cold calling and knocking on doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| I mean, I might go to see Dave, and while I'm in his subdivision, I might knock on three or four more doors while I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| Now I'm going to have to get a permit to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| According to this ordinance, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| We've had some people say, how come Commissioner Andrews has it, but Commissioner Brown doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| and the law says he's supposed to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| So we're just trying to make it fair across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Commissioner Brown, if it's not acceptable, I certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| We're just trying to simplify the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| Commissioner Longbeam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Just to clarify, this also would pertain to like Comcast, AT&T, anybody like that that does direct sales going door to door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4199)|
| 1:10:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Any individual, any company that goes door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Now the company can do one that blankets all of them or just each individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| Individual certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| And as the ordinance stands right now, it says that you can come and get a permit from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| and then take it to the Sheriff's Department, which I think is kind of backwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| because you can get your permit and never go to the Sheriff's Office, and we don't know whether or not you're legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| So this changes it around to where you go to the Sheriff's Department, get your background checked, and then come up and see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| Does this apply to the Avon lady and the Fuller Brush man too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| It applies to anybody, Commissioner, that goes door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Go back to what Commissioner Brown was talking about, an insurance agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| Let's just say Metropolitan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Metropolitan is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| They have agents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| You're saying each individual agent has to pay a fee on top of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| And what does the fee cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| The fee is $55 per month, and they would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| Fifty-five a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| Fifty-five a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| You said that in the last ordinance, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| It would be $55 per month, and they would have to renew the license per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| Is that per agent, or is that for the Metropolitan just pay it one time and it covers all their agents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| Or if Metropolitan's got 25 agents, they have to pay that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| It would be per agent, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| The reason behind that, Commissioner Smith, is so we can do background checks on everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| So, and again, this is your all's to reject, accept, modify, whatever you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| We're just trying to make it even and fair for everybody out there that's doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| Foster, I don't see $600 to check a background check per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| I mean, if you're saying $55 a month, how much does a background check cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| We just renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| We don't do a background check every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| The sheriff gets $10 to do the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| But you're going to collect $55 a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| You know, that's the amount you've been collecting from the previous, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| For the ones that will come in, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| It just sounds like we're getting on some industry toes here with cable and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| So now it's starting to hurt because it's getting to our friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| But we've imposed this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| So if we're going to reconsider this now, I'll say shame on us for not having considered the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| and the hurt that it's done to these other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| I, for one, tend to like this because I think we've gotten past the Avon lady coming door to door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4369)|
| 1:12:58| and the Fuller Brush guy, not the stereotype, coming door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| I think we're beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| I think we're, you know, building relationships and networking via other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| And that person should know that I'm going to show up at 8 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| and talk about life insurance or financial planning or Kirby vacuum cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| So, you know, I really think this is part of that nuisance thing that we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| So I'm going to be in support of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| I can probably assure that Commissioner Smith would agree to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| but the company that I work for did a serious background check and testing and testing and testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| and everything else before they hired people and trained them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| To say that I'm going to have to spend another $55 a month to be able to go out here and earn a levy, that's usury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4430)|
| 1:14:01| We have a motion to approve on first reading, mind you, on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I'm going to vote no on this just because I think $55 per month is just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| I know what Sam was saying, that we talked about that before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| but the people that do it on a daily basis, I mean, that's quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| I'm going to offer a substitute motion to defer this for a month to let us look for alternative measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4466)|
| 1:14:34| to hopefully do what Foster is wanting to do and protect the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| I mean, we've had magazine companies come in with solicitors that have committed violent crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| and so they can say they've had a background check, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| So I'm going to make a substitute motion to defer this for a month to study an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| From a homeowner's standpoint, I know that when I lived in the subdivision in Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| these people would come in in a van, and they would let them out, and they would just start going door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| I find that dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| I'm in favor of imposing the fee, the background checks, whatever we have to do, because that's my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| That's my home and my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Anybody who cold calls and knocks on my door, I want to know that if they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| that they have had a background check, that they are legit, and they're not going to take the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| and stick it in their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| And anybody who is legitimate is probably going to call me and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| let's set up an appointment or I'd like to sell you something at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| I'm inviting them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| They're not being invited when they just come in and let people out of a van| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| and they start going door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| And I've seen it, and I know it happens, and I think that we need to take a strong measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| against this type of activity because, yes, they're trying to earn a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| but also I have rights, too, on my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| and I would like to know that whoever knocks on my door is legit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| and if I ask them the question, show me your credentials, and they have none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| then we know to call the police and get them out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| But if they do have credentials, then I make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Do I want to talk to them or do I want to say no, thank you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| But I'm all in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Commissioner Hammond, I agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| The people coming out of the vans, I'm all for stopping all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| One last question, and I know we'll talk about it next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| but just so I'll sort of get an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| Foster, I co-call on businesses throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| Is that going to be exempt or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| It applies to home-to-home, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Just home-to-home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| And we'll be glad to sit down and work with you guys and talk to you about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| and come up with whatever you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| I mean, we can have every insurance agent and knuckle fill the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| We have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| There's another aspect of this door-to-door thing, and it's called campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| And I wonder sometimes about identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| and to those people who are campaigning for elected offices also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| There might be some blanket way of identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| and verifying that, indeed, this is a candidate who is qualified or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| So that might be an aspect of this when we take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| Or campaign workers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| All right, we have a substitute motion, which is to defer one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| look for alternatives, and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| All right, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Deferred one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Noss County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| amending Noss County Code, Chapter 26, Article 3, entitled Noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| to amend Section 26-67, Prohibiting Acts Enumerated by Adding a Subsection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4668)|

| 1:18:17| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| I just had a question last week, and my question was to the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| I don't know if ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| I just had a question for the Sheriff's Department on this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| and that's on enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| And it's that age-old question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| You know, we sit up here as legislators and pass these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| and it becomes an undue burden on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| So, you know, this one, I don't know if you've read it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| but it's just, you know, it's after kids skateboarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| and making excessive noise in residential areas after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| I don't know what we ended up on time-wise, 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| So, you know, it may end up with an increase, not undue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| but an increase in calls to your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| and may take forces away from, you know, more heinous acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| So, again, I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| Are you comfortable with this ordinance is my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| and being able to take care of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| I'm Eddie Biggs, Sheriff's Office, 400 Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| To answer your question, sir, if this passes, it will be a low priority for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| Obviously, others would take precedent of any type of call, basically, that I can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| And secondly, a misdemeanor has to be committed in the officer's presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| before they can take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| The alternative to that, according to a new law that took effect July 1st of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| that's going to take effect is criminal summons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| To do that, there has to be a detective or an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| that goes with the complainant to sign the summons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| So that may put a hardship back on the public to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| They may not want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| But anything you pass, we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| But that's the two issues I felt need to be voiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Okay, could you explain the summons again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| There's a new statute, as I think the law director's aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| that they passed for the state that requires criminal summons be issued on many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| particularly misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| The officer can go and get a warrant, but a private citizen cannot on certain offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| I think that's going to impact us greatly in regards to shoplifters and things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| for people that work in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| It may cause us a real issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| But we do have, the city has it and we have it, warrant screeners that look at these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| and then they go before the commissioner and present the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| and they make a final decision if we're going to sign it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| So on this one, I think what I heard you say is if, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| someone's out there skateboarding in this subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| this neighbor makes a call, and you show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| and the kids are off their skateboards walking down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| you can't cite them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| You may cite them for being away from the home at a certain hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| but you can't cite them for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| When you mention summons and warrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| I guess the image is that you could have an officer who could issue a ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| so to speak, at the point, at the point of the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| That's not something that you can do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| The officer could, in fact, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| He could write a summons if he sees it happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| but he can't take the homeowner's word that it happened and act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| That's what I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| He's got to witness it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| So it's got to be in the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Yeah, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| And then my other question was to the law director just in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| that we mentioned our code in terms of noise issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4936)|
| 1:22:24| If that needs to be reviewed or, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| noise is given the nature of our metro area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| it seems noise will be an increasing problem possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| So I just wanted the law director to give us an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| about the status of our noise code right now given where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4965)|
| 1:22:54| Currently under the code of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| we have various specific noise ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| We don't have a great universal one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| but we have one like for barking dogs, for mufflers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| for unloading equipment at night, for engines without mufflers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4988)|
| 1:23:19| fixed engines mainly, not vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| We have them for vehicles too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| So each one of them have the noise ordinance we have are with specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| similar to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| This one is similar to the barking dog type noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| But each of these fit under the same misdemeanor category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| that Chief Biggs is talking about, even the ones we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| And how they will be enforced is exactly the way the chief is talking to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| is the misdemeanor rule in the presence of an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| So a felony is a different ballgame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| but what we're talking about here is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| And I think you've got good information from Chief Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| as to how it would be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| And, of course, he has also mentioned priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| But each of our noise ordinances are very similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| and I think they've probably come up over time with some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| increase of a particular complaint that's come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| So do you consider the way we're going about the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| with the specific instances of noise is the good way to go, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5062)|
| 1:24:30| given things are going to get worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| Or let's just make the assumption that noise is going to be an increasing problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| in a variety of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Well, what you're doing now is it's very identifiable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| as to what the root cause of the noise is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| and whether it's covered or not, and our police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| our sheriff's department can identify those and know to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| If you go to a general noise ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| you're going to be dealing with a certain type of decimals of sound then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| And then it's got to be measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| And then there's going to have to be a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| And then you're getting into a lot of ambiguity that is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| that the judgment of a police officer at the time becomes very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| and we're throwing a big burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| So it would take more than just a snap judgment here for me to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| whether it would be a good thing or a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| I think it would be something more we'd have to talk with the law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| in conjunction with in trying to figure out if it's a good thing that's enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| We can create a noise ordinance that may totally be unenforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| but it covers everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| So specificity gives them at least a specific thing to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| It's very measurable by sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| and they can determine if it's a noise that is, you know, unreasonable at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| and make some professional judgments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| But just a noise noise out there and what is it and where's it coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| that would take a little research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| I don't know how enforceable we could make one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| And thank you, Chief Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| The only other, and this is kind of an aside on issues of low priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| like this would be a low priority, of course, for law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| But sometimes those things, and this is just a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| some of the things that are low priority are indicators of other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| that are really going to go into a higher priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| I always think of people, and I get comments in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| from people like littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Littering is a low priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| But people that pitch that stuff out of their cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| a lot of times they might not be a low priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| if you actually got in the car and looked at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| But that's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| We have a motion and a second on the floor for approval on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| We're about to move into budget, but I've had a request for a ten-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| So without objection, 15, come back at 310.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| I'd like to recognize my staff is still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| and if anyone would like to speak to the staff, the staff is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| 310, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| Is she well paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| Back to your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| We'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5242)|
| 1:27:51| Because they don't want them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| They depend on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5273)|
| 1:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| We're going to go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| If you'll go ahead and call the roll on the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Go ahead and read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| On page 10, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| establishing a general county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| and making a procurations from the several funds for departments, institutions, offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| and ending June 30, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| and approving the organizational chart of the executive branch of Knox County Government Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| Yes, I'd like to offer a substitute motion that keeps this budget intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| but adds $21 million for employee pay raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| a step and a 3% for all county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| and a 3% increase only for teachers since they're getting their step already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5349)|
| 1:29:18| What's your funding source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| A $0.21 property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| And the reason I'm bringing this up is because the research that I've done recently on what our people are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5366)|
| 1:29:37| and their history of pay raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5377)|
| 1:29:45| pay raises have not kept pace with cost of living, not even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| We have at least, well, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5390)|
| 1:30:02| close to 100 employees who qualify for food stamps based on their income, a family of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5402)|
| 1:30:13| That could be a single parent with two children or a single parent with a child and a grandparent living with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5413)|
| 1:30:22| And we have, looks like, over 400 employees who are at risk if they don't already qualify for food stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5422)|
| 1:30:39| And I feel that, you know, in East Tennessee, we're so proud of ourselves for taking care of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5439)|
| 1:30:51| We complain about the big bureaucracy of the federal government and their entitlement programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5451)|
| 1:31:00| But when you look at what we're doing here in Knox County, we're not taking care of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5460)|
| 1:31:08| And we are making them dependent on that federal bureaucracy that we all say we don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5468)|
| 1:31:19| Now, a $0.21 property tax increase for a person who owns a home that's worth $100,000, that comes out to $50 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5479)|
| 1:31:31| It's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| For someone who owns a $50,000 home, that's $25 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5493)|
| 1:31:40| That's not much for us to be able to say that we take care of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| I think that we want the best county employees that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5506)|
| 1:31:55| And when we pay them so little that they become dependent on the federal government for food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5515)|
| 1:32:03| it makes it difficult for us to attract and retain the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| Now, these employees are also taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| I'm a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| And I think this is something that is completely worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| I understand that there are a lot of people who want to make it all the way through their term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| so that they can brag about how they never approved a property tax increase while they were in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5547)|
| 1:32:35| And I would ask you to think more about the people who serve the people of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5555)|
| 1:32:45| than the people who are just interested in their reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| I understand that for a lot of people who are looking at renting in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| you can just hear those robocalls saying so-and-so voted for a property tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| and it can scare you away from doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| So I would ask that you not think about that next election and shut down in your mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5588)|
| 1:33:19| those robocalls that you are afraid are going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| and focus on the job you have to do today, right now, in this job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5604)|
| 1:33:32| and doing the best thing that we can for the people who serve not just us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| but every resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| There are a lot of you, too, who are through the difficult part of your campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5621)|
| 1:33:50| where a vote like this is not going to hurt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| You don't have to worry about those robocalls coming in a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| There are a lot of people, and I know from talking to many of you during Properly Sunshine meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5638)|
| 1:34:05| that there is an agreement that at some point a property tax increase is going to have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| And right now, this year, is the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5652)|
| 1:34:18| And we're not looking at a huge increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Like I said, it's only 21 cents, and it's only for raises for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5661)|
| 1:34:31| who have gotten the short end of the stick for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| who are dependent now on the federal government for food for their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| and who work incredibly hard for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| It includes a step and a 3% for every person in the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| every person in the general county employee pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| and a 3% raise for everyone in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| from custodians to bus drivers to teachers to food service employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5703)|
| 1:35:12| And it's only $21 million that makes that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5712)|
| 1:35:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| I won't say only $21 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| I'll say $21 million is a lot of money, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| I'll say that passing the 21% property tax increase is a bold step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| It would be a monumental lift for this body to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5744)|
| 1:35:52| And just because I'm in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| I don't want to be typecast as a fiscally liberal because I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| I've been on this body since my sixth budget, and, you know, we've not increased taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5764)|
| 1:36:16| We've not fought for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| And I'll just say it's time to treat our employees fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| This will be a fair step for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| When I say employees, I mean I'm putting everyone in one basket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| I'm not segregating educators from the folks working in the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| or Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| But to say the non-education, the folks on the executive side of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| really haven't been, you know, every year we do not give them a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| We're actually taking money from them because their benefits have gone up each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| The amount they pay to park in this building has gone up since 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| I don't have those numbers with me, but it's gone up significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| The amount the White Castle has gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| Camp was $0.25 in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| Gallon of gas was $1.16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| It's tripled for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Eggs was $1.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| Milk was $2.79 a gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| I don't think a half gallon is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| I think it's like over $2.00 for a half gallon, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| $2.09, I think, on sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| So, I mean, the cost of living, the cost of a meager existence has gone up since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| But more importantly, over the last, you know, five to seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| we just haven't been keeping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Our pay rates haven't been keeping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| So this isn't for a fluff and nitty department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| This isn't for, you know, a slush fund or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| This is to put a few more dollars into people's pockets to help them make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5880)|
| 1:38:09| You know, you look at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| They're going up on rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Every time the fuel charge goes up, there's not even a vote anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| TVA goes up on rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| It's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Fuel charge goes up, we pay more, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| There's nothing you can vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| So, and when we pay more, the sheriff pays more, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| So, you know, that takes a part of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| So it's just, it's time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| It's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| And to be quite honest, now's not a bad time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| There's never a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| There's never going to be a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Okay, yeah, we just came out of a recession, but we really did come out of a recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| Are we fully out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Are we back in the land of milk and honey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| Are we back in the land of the dot com?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| No, we're not in a boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| But $50 a month for a house valued at $100,000 is a sacrifice for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| But I think it's a worthy sacrifice for the people that provide a valuable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5948)|
| 1:39:16| I was out this weekend off of Western Avenue going to the really, really small Commissioner Anders waste station out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5956)|
| 1:39:27| And it's really tight turns in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| So I'm glad you're getting a new one eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| But, you know, that guy in there was working his tail off on a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| I'm sure that was his regular shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| I mean, he was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| He was making sure the waste streams were going in the right places to save work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| And not just a smidgen, you know, like the mayor brings folks up to recognize them during his budget times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| I mean, I want to call that guy out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| I mean, he was working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| I had a five-gallon bucket of empty can of paint, and he wanted to make sure that it was dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| I mean, you know, he was doing his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| And that's what our county employees do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| They do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| They do what they're told, and they do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| And it's a lot, you know, in terms of volume, we're asking them to do a lot more today than we probably did in 1999, I'd venture to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6011)|
| 1:40:24| So, I'm in favor of this, so I'll be voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| So, I'll just ask you to strongly consider voting yes on this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Mark, could you get Mark Jones and Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| I don't know which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| It might be a Mark Jones question, but Chris, you can back him up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6039)|
| 1:40:48| Let me go back to what Commissioner Boyle said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Amy, you talked about the people, 100 people on food stamps, and I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| What is the food stamp level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| What is the income level for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6057)|
| 1:41:05| Do you know, Mark, do you know, or Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| For a family of three, that makes less than $25,392 gross annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6068)|
| 1:41:19| They qualify for food stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| What about an individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Amy, do you have an individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| An individual, I believe, is around 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6085)|
| 1:41:32| Yeah, it's all on, I got all this online from the USDA, and I was going with the family of three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6092)|
| 1:41:42| because we have so many single parents with children or a single parent with a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| and a grandparent living at home, or even, you know, a married couple with a child who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6109)|
| 1:41:59| the husband ends up having to stay home to care for the child because on this salary they can't afford child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6119)|
| 1:42:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| Mark, what, or Chris, what do we start people out, somebody, or number one, do we have part-time people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| Do we have people that work part-time for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| So I'm thinking that might be some of that 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| No, these are all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| What I asked them for, I asked them for how many employees made less than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6147)|
| 1:42:34| for the family of three made less than 25,392,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| and how many for the family of four made less than 30,624, and these are all full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6160)|
| 1:42:49| None of them are part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| What do we start, and I'm sure it may vary from department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| but what do we start our people out at, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Somebody coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| The way the salary matrix is set, a pay grade eight is the lowest where we've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| We moved it up from last year when we did the salary survey, and that's $9.80 per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6186)|
| 1:43:14| We don't have anyone out of the four employees we have in pay grade eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| All of those are making below the minimum steps, though, which is about, it's above 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6201)|
| 1:43:31| Okay, because I just divided this out real quick on the calculator here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| and somebody making $19,000, that comes out working 12 months, 40-hour week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| it comes up $9.13 an hour, and we would start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| It's $9.80, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| That's what she's saying the food stamp level is, is $9.13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| We pay $9.80 according to what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| That's the minimum at the start of that grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| So for families, that's something else, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| I mentioned this a week or two ago about what the problem is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| You know, I think $0.21, it doesn't sound like a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| but you have to remember that some of our poorest citizens in the county live in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| and the city is looking at a $0.34 rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| So we're really talking about a $0.55 tax increase for some of our citizens, poorest people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6265)|
| 1:44:34| If you really, and I'm not going to get into the city's business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| but we talked about it today at the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| The city may very well have to raise rates again for their pension in a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| because they're still going to have some fairly significant liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| Two years ago, when this issue of a $0.35 pay raise came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| if I'd known we were going to do this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| I would have brought a recording that a lady sent to me about how she was right on the verge of losing her home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| And so there's taxpayers who are going to be hurt if we do this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| You've got to remember, a lot of them are getting a $0.55 property tax increase this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| and they may very well see more in the next year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| I would like to remind everyone that we have made some decisions in the last five and six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| or four years on this commission that we wouldn't be sitting here discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| We could have had pay raises maybe every year or pretty close to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| if we had made some different decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| We had a company that had been in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| I looked at it on the side of a truck today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| It said since 1891.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| They left and have gone to Rhone County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| And I believe we looked at that when we were talking about one of our other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| I think they were paying $10 or $12 million in taxes that now is going someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6346)|
| 1:45:54| If you recall, we also had a woman that wanted to take some of our land to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| The company was called K-Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| It was a female-owned company, restaurant equipment distributorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| We gave preferential hiring to single women with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| We told her that she would be sued to the point she would probably never open her business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| and the message was she was not welcomed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| She's taken her business elsewhere, and in the Wall Street Journal week before last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| K-Tom now is one of the 25 fastest-growing female-owned companies in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6385)|
| 1:46:32| We turned them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| We voted to have an industrial park several years ago that could be developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| that could be also bringing in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| And we decided that we really didn't need the money that much, and we turned them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| At some point, the chickens come home to roost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| And what we're doing now, we're robbing from some of the people in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| to pay other people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Do the teachers deserve a raise? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Do the officers deserve a raise? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| We've had plenty of opportunities in the last several years to do something about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| and we basically felt that it wasn't so important that our citizens have high-paying jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| that we don't have a higher tax base, that we could get by without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| And now that it is a time when they do need a pay raise, we're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| well, let's raise the taxes and hurt other people who may not have the means to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| And like I say, at some point, we have to be held accountable for our actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| One other issue that happened here before we were on the commission was we sent away a minor league stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| And I think Mr. Hammond told me a week or two ago that there's 300,000 people attend those games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| that would be coming into Knox County rather than into Sevier County during a summer season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6463)|
| 1:47:49| That was turned away here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| So I think we've had other alternatives where everyone could benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| rather than proposing something where people can be hurt very severely that are barely able to afford their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6475)|
| 1:48:05| Before I call on Commissioner Broll and Commissioner McKenzie, I guess I'll get my side of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| I've said for two or three years we are coming to a point where the growth in Knox County is going to catch up with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6493)|
| 1:48:21| I think we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| I think this year proves that we are very close to being, have outlived the distance of a 54-cent tax increase in 1999, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6503)|
| 1:48:35| And over those years, we've had the equivalent of an 11-cent tax increase when you count the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| And so for almost 15 years, we've lived on growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| And I've had the discussion with multiple people that there's going to come a time that that ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| And I think we're seeing the beginning of that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| And although that I do agree that everybody that works for this county deserves a raise or at least a plan to bring that to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6536)|
| 1:49:09| And I think the only thing that sets me back on this issue is that we have to take a look at all of Knox County's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6549)|
| 1:49:20| Highways and roads, you heard a report today that the highway department is losing revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6560)|
| 1:49:29| There are hundreds of thousands in deficit from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| And so we've got projects we've got to take care of, and we're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| We get requests every month for roads to be paved and things that need to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| and Jim Snowden stretches every dollar that we give him to make sure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| And so I think without a plan in place to take care of all of our needs instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| I think it's wrong to have a tax increase for one purpose when you have other needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| and not go ahead and have a discussion about the whole thing, the whole ball of wax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| Because you don't do it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| You shouldn't do it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| And, you know, in the best of times, a tax increase should last 10, 12 years hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| And I don't think that a 21-cent tax increase would last much past two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| And so that's the reason that since we haven't had a long-term, big-picture discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| I can't support the current proposal on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| So do you all want last word, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| Because Commissioner Norman has now turned on his light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| Okay, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| I'm speaking also in opposition to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| So a couple of observations about it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| One, and of course the schools are our biggest component of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6650)|
| 1:50:58| and if this substitute motion fails and then we go back to the acceptance of the original budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6658)|
| 1:51:06| I'd like to go on record of making an objection at least to the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| And so I don't think just the passage of our budget should not be noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| or I'd like to be noted as objecting to the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| in the terms that their increase of some $9 million this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6684)|
| 1:51:32| is just an example of how it draws a lot of revenue every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6692)|
| 1:51:41| and it disables the rest of the county, in effect, I think, from giving the raises to the county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6701)|
| 1:51:49| And so we need to acknowledge that as a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| And so that's my primary reason for putting my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6713)|
| 1:52:04| So just an objection to the county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| And I think it is also a perfect example when we talk about bureaucracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6727)|
| 1:52:15| that the school system and the administrative function of the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| is a perfect example of a bureaucracy out of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| and the fact that their budget essentially reflects no change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6743)|
| 1:52:32| no willingness to cut any program, anything that has been so objectionable to the teachers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6752)|
| 1:52:45| So the teachers are looking forward to another year of similar treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| and the similar types of stresses and pressures that they've had to endure here now for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6771)|
| 1:53:00| One other item and then I'll be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| As to Dr. Briggs' examples of businesses that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6783)|
| 1:53:10| and I agree in part with his assumption that we're not doing what we should do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| in terms of growing business, growing the revenue side of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| Those examples of Hackney and K-Tom and Industrial Park and the minor league baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6801)|
| 1:53:29| I would like to say though there's a lot of different people that were involved in those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| And I don't think this commission is anti-business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| and I certainly don't think that our actions on this commission could be labeled anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6818)|
| 1:53:46| I think those four examples of maybe missteps in terms of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| there's a whole lot of people that get a bite of that sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| And so I don't want to accept that label that we're anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6835)|
| 1:54:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| Commissioner Rose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Sam, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| Well, first let me correct the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| I think I said $50 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| I meant $50 a year would be that $0.21 property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| So with that said, I am sure I'm going to draw the ire of several commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| with my last statement on this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| But to the citizens of Knox County, I think what you've just heard is politics at its best or politics at its worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6873)|
| 1:54:42| If you're in the habit of saying no, there's always a great reason to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6882)|
| 1:54:48| You've just heard a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| If we can't solve it all, you know, if I can't end global warming, then why not burn coal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| You know, I can't end it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| So let me continue to burn this leaded gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| It's just too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| I'm not going to vote for this, but teachers, y'all still my friends, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6910)|
| 1:55:18| I would have given you some money, but, you know, too many other strings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| Let's continue to beat up on administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| If you all would have signed up to Midway, all the world would have been great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| and we would have still been the land of milk and honey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| Distinguished Commissioner from Farragut is trying to tell my folk in District 1, the poorest district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6938)|
| 1:55:48| probably fighting hard with District 2, that they're going to pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| The people in District 1 are talking to me, and they're saying, Sam, we want dollars for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6955)|
| 1:56:02| We'll pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| That's what they're telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| The ones that I see at Crow Girl, I see at the ball field, they understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| That's why, more than likely, the city budget will pass, because that's what they're telling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| So don't say, well, how it's going to be undue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| You guys have never, every time I mention city, a hush fills the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| Now we're going to use the city's budget to say we're not going to pass the county's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| That's the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| Just say we're not going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| Don't come up with all these lame excuses, and that's what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| They're lame excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Either we're going to pass a dollar budget to solve everyone's problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| or either we're going to only carve out the people that I don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| or we're going to do this thing in concert with the city, or we're not going to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| What we're going to do, end up doing, is getting ourselves upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| And just like with the teachers, our county employees, our sheriff officers are going to start looking elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7027)|
| 1:57:15| And once that barn door is open, it's going to be hard to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7035)|
| 1:57:22| It's going to be extremely hard to close it, because we're not going to be able to close the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| We're getting behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| This will be a great year, especially the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| This will be a great year to catch up a little bit, because other systems aren't in a position to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7053)|
| 1:57:41| As the reason, and I think Chris will tell you, one of the things our folks that give us our barn rating say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7061)|
| 1:57:51| we're not taxing nearly to our capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| That's a piece of it, too, that we don't talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| That's part of our bonding that we don't like to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| There's pieces to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| There's slices to this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| So we could do some catching up with this 21 cents in several ways, but we don't want to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| But to come up with lame excuses, it's just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| And again, if I've stepped on toes, I've stepped on toes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| But this is the right thing to do for our employees right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7105)|
| 1:58:33| Commissioner Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| I'll add to that that some of the excuses that I've heard were not just lame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7116)|
| 1:58:46| They were also, frankly, condescending to those of us who represent the poorest people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7126)|
| 1:59:01| Mayor O'Hara proposed a 34-cent tax increase and got a standing ovation because the people in the city trusted her vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7141)|
| 1:59:16| and her leadership and realized how important it is to invest in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7156)|
| 1:59:25| And they value their city employees, and they value the services that the city provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7165)|
| 1:59:38| And they know that they don't come free, and some of them don't come cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7178)|
| 1:59:44| And you're right, there are a lot of other things that we've let slide over the years, such as road paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7184)|
| 1:59:51| I would love to see a property tax increase that was high enough to take care of the paving, our employee raises, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7191)|
| 2:00:03| But this seemed like a very good first step because it was a very moderate step just to kind of get at least our people back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7203)|
| 2:00:17| This vote is a vote as to whether or not we truly value our employees or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7217)|
| 2:00:24| Do we really take care of the people in Knox County, or do we pass them off to the government, federal government, that we complain about so much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7224)|
| 2:00:37| There's probably nobody up here whose family income is less than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| I'm willing to pay more in property tax increase so that our employees can get closer to what they deserve to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7242)|
| 2:00:53| Like I said, for someone with a $100,000 home, we're only talking about $50 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| There are a lot of, it's very easy to say no to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| You can come up with a lot of, as Commissioner McKenzie said, lame, and as I added, condescending reasons to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7264)|
| 2:01:16| But there's also some really good reasons to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| Those are the people who work for us so hard every day, not just for us but for all the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7280)|
| 2:01:27| By the way, they're taxpayers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| So a vote for this is a vote for the employees of Knox County, and a vote against it lets them know exactly where you stand on how they're valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7291)|
| 2:01:45| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| First off, let me say I'm not going to vote for a 21-cent tax increase at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7311)|
| 2:01:58| But I agree, I've been sitting here thinking with what Commissioner Anders said a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7318)|
| 2:02:05| And this is my sixth budget up here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| And I think we are coming to the point in Knox County where we'll begin to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7330)|
| 2:02:18| But it's not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| Nobody values our Knox County employees any more than this group sitting up here, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7342)|
| 2:02:29| because we understand and know what they do day after day after day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| And nobody appreciates them any more than what this group does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| But this is something that, as Commissioner Anders said, is going to take some study, some planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7359)|
| 2:02:48| You can't just say pull a figure out of the air and say give everybody a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| We're going to have to sit down and say, okay, we need this, we need this, we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| How much is it going to take to do it next month and start planning on next year's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| So we know what we've got to do when this time comes around next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| And it's not thrown up at the last minute in our face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7387)|
| 2:03:12| But it's going to have to be sold to the people along the way as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| They're going to have to be made a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| So this is, I think we're at the point we can start making some progress, as I said a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| I really truthfully believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| But it's going to have to be planned out properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| I just want to say, I sort of look at the budget a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| We know how much money we've got coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| We know this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| Some of it we do at our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| We know how much money that we've got to work with, and we work within that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| We have a fiduciary responsibility to our citizens that we're going to live with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7436)|
| 2:04:03| We can tax and tax and tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| I'm looking at our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| I'd love to give our employees more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| They know going in, according to what Mark just told us, they know coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| they'll make $20,384.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| If that's not enough for them, then they might apply somewhere else if that doesn't meet their need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| It was really eye-opening to me at the retreat with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| when it was stated that we have given the school board $4.2 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| That sort of blew me away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| In the last 10 years, we've given them $4.2 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7475)|
| 2:04:43| I did two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| I did Central High School and Powell High School Friday, and I did breakfast for the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| I spent an hour at each school, and I sat at different tables with all the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| and spent a lot of time with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Not one teacher came up to me and said, give us a raise, give us a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| Not one disgruntled teacher out of about 150 to 175 teachers said one word to me, and they knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7504)|
| 2:05:11| I talked about commission just a little bit while I was there to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7511)|
| 2:05:17| I think we're living in our means and trying to be responsible with how much money we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| Chris knows how much money is coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| If next year is better, we'll pave more roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| We'll do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| I think we're attacking it in a responsible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| We've all got wish lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| I can do a lot of things in my district, an awful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| Dave can do a lot in his district where he's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| All of us can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| But we learn to, you know, sometimes we have to tell our kids no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| We can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| We're living within our means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| To me, that's why I was put in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| I was put in office to work with what money that you've got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| If we just had to have an increase, you know, I'd look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| but I don't see this as a have-to situation that we have to do this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| So, Mayor, I appreciate your budget, the time that you put into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7565)|
| 2:06:12| and Chris for all that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| People look next year and see how much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| Hopefully next year will be better and they can do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| Just one final short comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| I'm glad you mentioned Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| We're very lucky to have Chris in our finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| This past year he has kept us up to date on everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| always up front and fast with whatever information we ask of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| He is a frugal planner, and if there's any way to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| I honestly believe that Chris Caldwell will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| Not only was he voted the most eligible at that thing you went to, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7612)|
| 2:06:59| but we are lucky to have Chris, and I just want you to know, Chris, I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| All right, we have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| The substitute motion would add $21 million to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| and also 21 cents would in turn go into the next thing and make the tax rate 2.53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7632)|
| 2:07:21| So let's have a roll call budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| Roll call on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7647)|

| 2:08:13| Okay, two to nine, the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| We go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| I want to add a caveat to the original motion if I could, Larry, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| That if the BEP changes upward, that it all goes to the school and no changes on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7705)|
| 2:08:32| Is that the discussion we had, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| So if the 2.9 comes into fruition after discussion with the state board, then it just reverts over to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7716)|
| 2:08:44| And the county side number does not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| I just had a question before we make the motion and the resolution to vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7728)|
| 2:08:55| Would there be a proper way to put an amendment on the budget that we either do a look back after the first quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7735)|
| 2:09:02| to see what the sales tax and some of the situations in there and maybe even do a look back at the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7742)|
| 2:09:11| if we did see for some reason that the sales taxes were increasing or the revenues increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| or we had a change in the BEP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| The BEP is going to have to all go to the schools, I believe, by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| But if we did see some unexpected increases, just like this year we saw unanticipated decreases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| that we could look back at that and see if we could do something for the county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7771)|
| 2:09:36| the school teachers, and the law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| I think Chris and I had that discussion in our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| and we talked about if there was room at the closeout and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| I think normally if we set a budget we don't do that and we just call that excess funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| But maybe have a formal presentation and say this would be our intention if we're able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7793)|
| 2:09:58| That would be the closeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| All right, we have the original motion on the floor, and we need a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7807)|

| 2:12:23| Excuse me, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| I'm going to slip out before this last vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| I'm supposed to pick up Aiden from camp at four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| So, sorry, Ned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7946)|
| 2:12:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| I'll be quick here, Chris, just a couple of capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7949)|
| 2:12:45| You're moving to cut it by 58 million in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7965)|
| 2:12:52| So, about just under 20 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7972)|
| 2:12:57| OK, I've got a lot of different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| I'm just trying to put them to coordinate them to your drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| But the actual general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| is dropping about $8 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| I'm looking at it from 2011 through 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| a drop of $62 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| Is that right, about $8 million a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| Yeah, from 2011 through the proposed of 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| we would have dropped by $34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| And in actuality, the schools, when you include that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| it's dropping considerably too, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| But it goes back up, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| The schools piece dropped from about $2.86 to about $2.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| And that's before the study will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| done on the two middle schools, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| And the majority of your general government is highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| $10 million, $14 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| Yeah, that would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| What's the 750,000 solid waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Is that one plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| That's the Carter Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| And I'm going to just run through this real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| in about 15 seconds or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8042)|
| 2:14:14| The 15, that includes, I'm going to put schools in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| PPU, they're there every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| The 16, that's the Pine Gap that Commissioner Olbey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| mentions and is referenced in the paper, that coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| and security upgrades and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| 17 is the big number, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| That's when Hardin Valley comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| Hardin Valley comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| If I would say this, and I'm sure they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| would want me to say this, if the feasibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| study says to build them, then we would start then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| 17, it runs up with Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| 18 is Powell, Adrian, Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| Yeah, and the completion of Hardin Valley, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| And then 19 is when the Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8097)|
| 2:15:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| $31 million for Gibbs coming online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| And you have $3.5 million for, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| the study for both schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| The study is $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| $1.5 million for Hardin Valley and $3.5 for Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| The study is $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| And so basically, what you see in 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| is the beginning of Hardin Valley with the $1.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| and then the beginning of Gibbs in 18 with $3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| $3.5, that's the preparatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| OK, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| All right, well, I think even with all those things in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| it is still, including the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| it's still down nearly $60 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| running through 19, which is very admirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| I'm reading it right, the geodet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| Yeah, we will go from, if you look back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| when we started in 2011 at $691.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| And by the end of 15, we'll be down to about $617.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| And so we're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| I think we keep going that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| We know that if the study says to build the middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| then that will drive that number back up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| But I think it's still at least headed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Another product that I would point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| that I think can be good for economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| is, in this budget, includes the beginning of Shod Road Phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| 2, and then also Shod Road Phase 3, beginning in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| And I think that will lead to bigger and better things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| in that part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| And I think it'll lead to a lot of expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| And this year includes the, I didn't mention this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| the Moreland Heights addition, $1.3 million, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8206)|
| 2:16:51| Yeah, that's cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8211)|
| 2:16:51| I didn't mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8214)|

| 2:18:52| We have to file a legal lawsuit complaint by June 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8332)|
| 2:18:59| to secure all the way back to, I think it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| 1983 and passed liquor by the drink tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| If we do not do that, then we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| go under the statutory option, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| will lose up until 1999, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| be close to a quarter of a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| probably a quarter of a million, $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| that we just push off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| So the state legislature has given us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| the option to file a suit, and we can continue to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| I don't mean that this just goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| but the filing of the suit must be done before June 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| to preserve our right to go back to the mid-'80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| If we fail to do that, then we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| pushing that off the table to the fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| in the liquor by the drink from 1999 to the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| So we've already got a request from the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| to pursue, and I thought it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| be short of an executive session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| important for you all to know, especially those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| are in the Farragut community and some of our West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| representatives and our at-large commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| to know the reason why we may be suing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| a community within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| And as I said, that is to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| the money that's on the table, the total pot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| instead of just part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| And we will continue to negotiate in good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| with the town of Farragut to see if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| can come to some resolution prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| to an actual trial on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| But it's incumbent on our due diligence to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| I wanted to inform the commission of that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| If you need to put something on the letterhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| you can put it on Dr. Briggs' letterhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Mr. Law Director, what discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| have we had with the town of Farragut on this up to now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| Well, the legislature has allowed for these discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8456)|
| 2:21:05| to be going on, and I think the school board has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| been discussing with them for several months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| There are several issues that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| talking about in terms of contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| priorly made to the schools and some kind of credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| that they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| We have interest that could potentially be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| We're owed a little over $1.3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| in liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| We have already made a settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| which should be before you next month with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| The city of Knoxville, believe it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| has actually paid those appropriately throughout time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| so they're not an issue within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| And the only one left standing is Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| So if we don't come to a settlement by August 31,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8509)|
| 2:21:54| then by December, the state basically will take it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| and it will be something like divided into 10 over 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| and you're going to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8525)|
| 2:22:06| So what we're trying to do is work out a plan to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| but that would only be from 1999 forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| And if we don't file the suit, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| lose a potential of $200,000 to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| So basically, the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| is going to pay something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| The question is, how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| No matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| All right, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8553)|
| 2:22:34| Do we need to take action, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| No, I think he's just letting us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| He's taking action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| Just a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| All right, we're adjourned until 5 o'clock for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| Mr. Chairman, let me have just a couple of announcements here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| One has to do with a publication that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| quoted out of in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| It's called Tennessee Archways, the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| of Tennessee College of Business Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| summer of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| Let me read one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| In a remote Ugandan village, a woman named Evelyn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8586)|
| 2:23:10| dances for joy, gripping a mug filled with water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| The story goes on to highlight a member of the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8595)|
| 2:23:23| here in Knox County, Doug Harris's work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| in helping families in Uganda have accessible, clean water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| It's a big spread with pictures and verbiage and scholarships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| being established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| Doug does a lot of work in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| And I just wanted to make sure that for those people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| do not get to see this, because it's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| to the business school graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| that this magazine's mailed looking for contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| I wanted to say I appreciate his work worldwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| And then one other announcement I'd like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| is the annual Daylily Blooms Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| at the Oaks Farm in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| It's Friday and Saturday, June the 27th and 28th, 9a to 3p.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8653)|
| 2:24:19| The Oaks Daylily Farm ships daylilies worldwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8659)|
| 2:24:25| And it's here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| And this is the two days out of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| that you can go to the farm and see all the blooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| and all their splendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| And it's in historic, rural, downtown West Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| West Corrington or East Corrington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8685)|
| 2:24:45| West Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| Don't be confused with East Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8686)|
| 2:25:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8720)|

| 2:27:55| All right, we have a, I got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| OK, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| Real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Are you going to have two entrances, one from Beaver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| Creek and one from Dry Gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| We're Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| No, we won't be able to access Dry Gap because of the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| Our only entrance will be off Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| Is it Josh Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| Josh Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8898)|
| 2:28:18| Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8905)|
| 2:28:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8906)|
| 2:28:27| Yeah, I just have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| On page 19, 4-E-14-SP is request of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8909)|
| 2:28:34| for a Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| from TP Technology Park to LDR Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8916)|
| 2:28:41| Property located southeast side of Coward Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| northeast of Pellissippi Parkway in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| I think this is one of the ones that came back to us from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| or we sent to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| So to get the discussion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| Well, there was no MPC recommendation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| Can you explain that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| Well, it's kind of somewhat related to what is allowed under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8943)|
| 2:29:09| It's the kind of thing where, regardless of MPC's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8949)|
| 2:29:12| you all can consider it and deal with it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| In this particular case, I think there was enough discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| on both sides of the issue that they felt like it was not clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| and they recommended to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| But you can still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| So our action is final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| Right, and you can deal with it today, one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| Okay, I see Mr. Davis is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| Is there any opposition that's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| Scott, do you care to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| Are you in opposition, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| If you'll come down to the mic there, we can't hear you from back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8989)|
| 2:29:56| Okay, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| I'll yield to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| What we have on the applicant's request was 2.5 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9003)|
| 2:30:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| Oh, this is sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| Sector plan, we're dealing with business park versus low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| On the zoning side, the applicant applied for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| There was discussion at the appeal about three, two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9025)|
| 2:30:32| A number less than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| So this is the sector plan amendment that allows us to go into the zoning issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9039)|
| 2:30:40| Now, the zoning issue is not before us because you need a sector plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| Well, it's further down on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| Okay, I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9053)|
| 2:30:54| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| After our last, I guess it was March, I guess when we did this and we sent it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| there was a meeting scheduled between Mr. Davis and the homeowners, which I attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9064)|
| 2:31:12| There was a compromise reached, it wasn't unanimous, but the consensus of everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9072)|
| 2:31:19| that was there, Mr. Davis offered three and they still wanted actually nothing or 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9079)|
| 2:31:27| So the consensus was that they would agree on three and that's, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| is what we're here for now is the three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9099)|
| 2:31:40| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9102)|
| 2:31:43| This question is for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| Didn't we also talk about this being a part and taking away part of the property available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| for the technology corridor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| That was the reason that staff recommended denial of, initially, of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| Yeah, the sector plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| I don't, I have my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| It was taking land out of that inventory for technology partner research and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9132)|
| 2:32:13| I don't have that map here in front of me, but how does this lay in relation to, is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9133)|
| 2:32:19| because it's not in the middle of properties that are technology corridor on Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9139)|
| 2:32:26| this property, and then on the other side of that more technology property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| Yes, sir, it is, it is, it's on the edge to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| You have technology park uses as well as to the north and the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9156)|
| 2:32:43| To the east, you have residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| Is it connected to any residential usage, adjacent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9168)|
| 2:32:56| It's closed, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| Yeah, it's got it on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Really, it's stuck in the middle of some technology corridor property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| It's on the edge of technology, it's on the edge of business, but connected to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9183)|
| 2:33:09| on the northwest side, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9192)|
| 2:33:13| It's not, it's not exactly at the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| There is, and I misspoke, there is a little bit of technology park pattern shown to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9196)|
| 2:33:22| east of the site, so it's not quite right, it's near the edge, but it is in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9202)|
| 2:33:29| north, south, and north, south, and west are technology park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9209)|
| 2:33:37| So the piece that is to the east, then, of the technology property, is it big enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9217)|
| 2:33:47| to put anything on, or are they going to wind up selling it to the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9227)|
| 2:33:55| Most of it is shown for low density residential, but there is a small piece, triangular piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| on the western side of that property to the east that is shown for technology park use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| Now, if you had the entire tract under technology park, it could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| We've had smaller tracts, we've had larger tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| It could also be developed for residential as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| I want to make sure that my memory is correct on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| The property is located there on Coward Mill, and as you go down Coward Mill, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| one-lane bridge there, and it goes over to the Ben Atchley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9274)|
| 2:34:35| That's the road I'm, I just want to make sure, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| That is Coward Mill, but you don't hit that bridge before you get to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9277)|
| 2:34:40| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| I just want to make sure, because I've looked at a lot of pieces, I want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| was the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| Now, as I recall, last time we were here, there were a couple of ladies here who expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| the fact that they really didn't want to sell this property, but that they were being forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| to, or they would rather not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9293)|
| 2:34:54| Am I, again, I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| They financially needed to because they couldn't afford to keep it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| That's you ladies, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| Again, again, I'm just trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| And so, there has been a meeting, according to Commissioner Owen B., and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| what we had said last time, was try to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| There was a meeting, and would both sides agree that three is what you all came to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9313)|

| 2:35:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9321)|
| 2:35:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| Does anybody want to speak to the, in agreement or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9324)|
| 2:35:29| I just want to make sure everybody has their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| What about the gentleman that came down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| He wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| Yeah, if you'll come up and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| My name is Howard Friedman, and I was at that meeting, and I think Mr. Owen B. is remembering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9339)|
| 2:35:46| exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| So, I just came down in case I needed to be in opposition, but I'm not in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| Friedman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9355)|
| 2:35:56| Friedman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| Scott wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| Oh, Scott, do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9360)|
| 2:36:01| Do we need to amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| Well, this is a sector plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| We don't need to do the dwellings right, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9367)|
| 2:36:08| This is sector plan only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9368)|
| 2:36:09| No dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| Chairman, just for clarification, I know you all deal with a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9372)|
| 2:36:19| It's hard to remember everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| That's the property there in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| This is technology overlay, and so it does join some existing residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9390)|
| 2:36:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| I'll make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment per the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9392)|
| 2:36:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9398)|
| 2:36:39| And second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| This has nothing to do with the zoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| This is the potential zoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| So, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9410)|

| 2:37:10| Is the applicant here, Ms. Hercules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9434)|

| 2:37:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9446)|

| 2:37:34| 4-F-14-SP is request of Knox County Commission for a northwest county sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9454)|
| 2:37:42| from LDR Low Density Residential to C Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| Property located north side of Hall Drive east of Mabry Hood Road in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9465)|
| 2:37:54| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| Yes, I'll make a motion to approve the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9475)|
| 2:38:02| We need Arthur to come talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| I do want to know if we've got opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| Is there any opposition to the Mabry Hood Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9494)|
| 2:38:15| Come, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| Give us a briefness again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, Arthur Seymour, Jr., I am here on behalf of the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| Steve Hobbs, who has owned this property for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| This property is on Hall Road between Dutch Town and Mabry Hood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9511)|
| 2:38:38| It used to be a remote, probably, part of the county before Pellissippi Parkway was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9518)|
| 2:38:45| With Pellissippi came change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| The property had been used for years for school bus storage, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9528)|
| 2:38:55| And not only Mr. Hobbs' property, but property directly across the road, property immediately adjacent to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9535)|
| 2:39:03| Now, he would be okay in an agricultural zone because he's grandfathered if he was only storing school buses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9543)|
| 2:39:12| He is in the business also of selling school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9552)|
| 2:39:19| They have a limited life in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| I think it's 15 years, Steve, that they can be used under contract with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| School buses have, if not hundreds of uses, a number of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9567)|
| 2:39:33| Churches love them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9573)|
| 2:39:34| They are sold for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| I've even seen people living in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| They're used for campers and all sorts of other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9580)|
| 2:39:45| He cannot, under the present zoning, sell school buses from that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9585)|
| 2:39:51| That is basically what he is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| I respectfully submit that this is sort of a pocket of Knox County like we found out in south Knoxville last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9594)|
| 2:40:02| There was a pocket of industrially used property that had been industrially used for a long time, but it was zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9602)|
| 2:40:12| My client contracted to buy part of it and had to get it upgraded to a commercial or industrial use before he could use it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9612)|
| 2:40:24| because although the property was probably grandfathered in, nobody knew exactly the history of it, it was not zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9624)|
| 2:40:36| I submit that there is property in the remoter parts or what used to be the remoter parts of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9636)|
| 2:40:44| that would fit the description of Mr. Hobbs' property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| I know MPC has raised the specter of spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9647)|
| 2:40:52| If you look right there at where Mr. Hobbs' property is, it is being commercially used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| not only his property but property around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| If you go to the east there at the intersection of Dutchtown Road and Hall Road, there is commercially zoned property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9661)|
| 2:41:10| Actually, I think there is a little more use than is zoned commercially there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9670)|
| 2:41:15| If you go across Maybury Hood Road there, there is a major office park, Century Park office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9675)|
| 2:41:27| or office park there that has two or three buildings in it right now and can handle three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9687)|
| 2:41:35| Behind or to the northwest generally of Mr. Hobbs' property, there is a church there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9695)|
| 2:41:42| Do they have a school, Mr. Hobbs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| They're building a school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| So this area is not really low-density residential, although it is designated that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9707)|
| 2:41:54| This comes back like the previous request for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| and we're asking that you approve an amendment to the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9719)|
| 2:42:04| so Mr. Hobbs can continue to use the property for what he has been using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| It's not going to be a retail tire center or anything where people come for tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9729)|
| 2:42:15| It's mainly to sell school buses to third parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9735)|
| 2:42:25| I guess I could ask a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| I mean, I don't mean to beat this thing to death because it's gone over and back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9747)|
| 2:42:36| and I rarely disagree with the staff, if ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| So I did want Buzz or Mark to talk about the discussion as it was in MPC, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9761)|
| 2:42:51| and hear your side of this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| So if you would, Buzz or Mark, either one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| Well, in looking at this and coming up with our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| we felt that if you allow commercial here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| then it's going to open up the door for other kinds of commercial requests in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9785)|
| 2:43:14| I fall back to the argument where you've got two or three other parcels in this vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| that are being used for something that is not allowed by the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9799)|
| 2:43:24| In other words, they're illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| We're not convinced that that's a good reason to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| It has to be a good, sound land use reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| We have no problem with it being used for storage of school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9812)|
| 2:43:37| In fact, as Council has pointed out, that has been determined to be a grandfathered use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9817)|
| 2:43:43| But we think because of this use and the impact it could have on the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9823)|
| 2:43:48| if other types of commercial zones would be approved, especially on Hall Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| we just don't think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| Further to the west, as pointed out also by Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| you do have an office or a business park being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| and that business park also has almost direct access to Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9843)|
| 2:44:09| and good access and good traffic flow into that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9849)|
| 2:44:14| So we were not convinced previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| and we were not convinced at the MPC hearing where MPC ratified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9857)|
| 2:44:25| or that's not the word I'm looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| but ratified their previous decision when it was under Mr. Hobbs' application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9867)|
| 2:44:32| to recommend denial of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| As we pointed out at the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| we would rather see if this is going to take place for one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| We would have rather seen a larger area studied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| looked at in terms of making a broader recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9885)|
| 2:44:49| that would possibly allow a mix of uses in what is roughly a triangular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9889)|
| 2:44:55| So we would have rather have looked at it from a broader perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| rather than deal with this one particular piece all by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| And let me just dovetail off of a buzz statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| that we have just kicked off the update for the northwest county sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9906)|
| 2:45:13| and given this decision to consider this particular property commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9913)|
| 2:45:21| we will take a look at that entire area south of Dutchtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9921)|
| 2:45:26| and above Webb School and east of Mabry Hood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| and consider the entire area then for commercial land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9929)|
| 2:45:36| and see if that works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| Okay, given those things and the lack of opposition from folks around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9942)|
| 2:45:49| at any time during this whole discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| the nature of that area is a very small little road, commercials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| a lot of commercial activity all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| I just think it's appropriate for Mr. Hobbs to have this opportunity to sell school stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9961)|
| 2:46:09| And so it might be spot zoning, but just given the nature of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9969)|
| 2:46:17| I think it's fair for Mr. Hobbs to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| So I'll be in support of the sector plan designation necessary to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9980)|
| 2:46:27| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair. What was the vote on this denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| On the current, it was 11-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9994)|
| 2:46:39| It felt pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| You know, I struggled with this one because you made some very valid points in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10002)|
| 2:46:49| you know, you're not just opening up for this, you're opening up for all kinds of commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| and that's troublesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| And then also, in terms of selling of buses, I go back to this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10016)|
| 2:47:03| and this is, you know, on Magnolia in my district, they were going to sell trailers, campers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10023)|
| 2:47:11| and you probably remember that, and now they're camper parts and pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10031)|
| 2:47:16| and it was so ugly now they put a fence up to hide the mess that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| I struggle with, you know, one man's, one woman's right to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10041)|
| 2:47:28| to the greater interest of that surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10048)|
| 2:47:33| That's a, this could be, when you're talking about selling buses, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10053)|
| 2:47:37| whole buses are one thing, but we also know buses are parted out and frames are sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10057)|
| 2:47:42| and tops of buses are sold and tires are sold and chassis are sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10062)|
| 2:47:47| So generally speaking, you know, as buses age, they tend to part them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10067)|
| 2:47:54| so this may not end up being a pristine trailer bus up for a newer bus operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10074)|
| 2:48:01| So I'm probably not going to support this one for two reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10081)|
| 2:48:07| for the reasons that Buzz pointed out, and then also, you know, historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10087)|
| 2:48:14| I just don't think these operations tend to work out as pretty and pristine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10094)|
| 2:48:19| as presented on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| So that's my feelings toward it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10101)|
| 2:48:26| Mr. Braden, can you come down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| I've got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10108)|
| 2:48:35| I believe that you guys were the initial, you got a complaint on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| and had to go out and do an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| It's been quite a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| I talked to Tammy Harvey, the code enforcement officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10123)|
| 2:48:46| that investigated this a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| and the owner of the property at the time showed her some paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| showing that they had been in operation there for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| and she made a note in the file that it was grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| that it was started the operation prior to 91,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10140)|
| 2:49:04| based on the information that she had, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10144)|
| 2:49:07| the owner had showed her at the time probably five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10147)|
| 2:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| And so what brought us here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10153)|
| 2:49:15| Was it this complaint that brought us here, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10155)|
| 2:49:20| Either a complaint or a finding from codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| I'm not sure, but that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| A complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10165)|
| 2:49:26| I think there was another complaint lodged in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10166)|
| 2:49:29| which would be two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| where the inspector showed complied because of the grandfathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10171)|
| 2:49:36| that she had come up with years before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| So you all are not currently looking to do an NOV or stop his work at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10180)|
| 2:49:47| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10189)|
| 2:49:50| But if this does not pass, would you be in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| Possibly would be, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10203)|
| 2:50:04| Author, is there a fence around the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| It's almost impossible to see from Hall Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| You've got it fenced, and it's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| There's a house in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| It's not visible from Hall Road at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| The one across the street is, but that's not Mr. Hobbs Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10220)|
| 2:50:23| How much traffic, how much more traffic do you anticipate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| There are school buses going in and out of Mr. Hobbs Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| the neighbor, and across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| We assume four trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| Go out in the morning, return in the morning, go out in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10238)|
| 2:50:41| and return in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| and there's never been a problem with traffic or accidents on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10243)|
| 2:50:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140527?start=10250)|
