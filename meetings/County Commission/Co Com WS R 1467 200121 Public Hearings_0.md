| 0:01:06| Nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Okay, we do have public forum on our agenda, and I also want to, realizing that we do have two back-to-back public meetings tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=68)|
| 0:01:20| I also want, and I see a lot of folks here, so uncharacteristically I'm going to reference that the next meeting after this one is going to be a discussion of the proposed amendments to the Knox County sidewalk construction standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=80)|
| 0:01:32| That's next. This discussion is related specifically to the Article 6 by adding a new Section 680 to create a plan development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=92)|
| 0:01:42| So beginning with public forum, the Chair recognizes Mr. Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| Mr. Murphy, if you could please approach the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| You've got five minutes, and that microphone's been a little funky tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| It actually does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| I'd like to, at this point, thank you for amending the ordinance at the first working session to remove the rural area from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| I'm here speaking on behalf of Knox County Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you for removing the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| We think that was a really important step because this is a very big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| It's a very different big development concept, and trying that out first in the planned growth area seems to make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=143)|
| 0:02:31| and gives the commission opportunity to revisit this in a year or so after we've cranked through a couple of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| and figured out what works and doesn't work and tweaked it before we play in sort of the more delicate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| So we appreciate that and also the grading thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| So we think there's probably, as this is run through the first few iterations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| we'll find a few wording tweaks that will help that you'll want to make later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| but we support the ordinance as it currently stands in front of you and was amended last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| So thank you for sending it back through so we could have some opportunity to discuss it, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Thank you, Mr. Murphy, as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| I might also add, I think we sent it back twice based on some feedback that we got from the planning alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=190)|
| 0:03:19| So I know that we're thinking most recently about that change, but if I recall correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| we sent it back five or six months ago, too, so that's actually twice that it's been sent back for changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| So the chair recognizes Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Is that your line on over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Is that Commissioner Jay's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| I can see a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| By the way, I'm going to read into the record what the discussion is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| or I can ask Madam Clerk to read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| We sprinted to the finish at the last meeting, but we do need to read item number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| By the way, is there anyone else who would like to speak on this item at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| Is there anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Madam Clerk, would you please read into the record item number three, and then we'll follow up with our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| This is a discussion of ordinance O-19-12-102, proposing amendments to the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| Appendix A, zoning, Article VI, by adding a new Section 6.80 to create a planned development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=256)|
| 0:04:27| No, that should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| The chair recognizes Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| I just simply want to acknowledge the hard work of the community groups and their input that made the process much stronger for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=273)|
| 0:04:41| and we just really want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=286)|

| 0:04:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Did other members of the community want to speak on this, or was Kevin just the designated spokesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=290)|

| 0:05:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| I'll be watching very closely the vote that happens at Farragut this week on the planned growth amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| and if that vote doesn't go as to the wishes of this body, I may be making an amendment to this ordinance come Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=311)|
| 0:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Any additional discussion on that, or is that just more of a friendly heads-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=330)|

| 0:06:29| I don't believe I've got a list of speakers in advance, but I'm sure there are some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| who would like to speak at public forum on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| So what I'll ask is basically the first person who comes forward, each of you will get five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=395)|

| 0:06:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=405)|

| 0:06:47| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Caroline Cooley, 903 Wingate Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| And I won't reiterate all the discussion from the last commission meeting, but I did want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=409)|
| 0:07:03| to bring to your attention that we did send a letter to each of you, I think yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| well, it was Sunday, regarding suggestions, recommendations as far as the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| We're still very concerned that if you have significant vehicular traffic within some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| of these subdivisions, that people will be discouraged from walking at all if there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| no sidewalks, that it's unsafe for people who would be walking, and we feel that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| needs to be some internal sidewalks, and we have put criteria for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| We also feel that the frontage roads on every subdivision should have sidewalks if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| ever going to have any connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| There's just no connectivity now, and so I think it's disingenuous to say we are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=469)|
| 0:07:59| to focus on external sidewalks when there's essentially no funding for external sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| There's no dedicated funding in the budget, and there's been very little sidewalk construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| done on existing roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| So I still encourage you to allow a narrower width in subdivisions, road width of 22 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=498)|
| 0:08:27| which does make the road safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| It slows the drivers, slows the motorists so that they do not exceed the speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| and I've given you some information to look at and read and some, I think, visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| Commissioner Jay, you said you wanted some visuals, so I've provided some, and I'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| more than happy to provide more for any other consideration, anything else you would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| And we do have some other people that would like to speak, so I'll stop now and take questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| if there are any questions for me or move on to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| I think Mr. Schoonmaker's got a light on, so he may have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Okay, and just for clarification, so your position is to go from the 26-foot road width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| to 22 and take the balance and use that for the sidewalks up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| I don't advocate for, yes, in that if you had a 22-foot roadway, I would not see necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| that you would have to have a sidewalk on that particular street, but we're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| about the entry roads into those subdivisions that have over 1,000 vehicular trips per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| coming into a subdivision, and if you have a sidewalk on the frontage road and then no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| sidewalk entering that subdivision, that's very high risk for someone to get off a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=586)|
| 0:09:53| and enter into a subdivision that has that much traffic coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| So we feel that the sidewalks on one side of the street should be required when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| that much vehicular traffic, and that's in the letter that we sent yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| I'm going to reread your letter and reread the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| I don't want to hear from Mr. Snowden, but is your organization's approach that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| a one-size-fits-all approach for every single circumstance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| So where does the latitude come from if you don't allow the professional's latitude to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| be able to make decisions according to the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| I think that that needs to be a discussion between the engineers and the planners, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| You've taken the MPC completely out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| I think even at the city level, the city engineer, it's true, is the one that has the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| But I know as policy that the engineers are discussing it with the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| And I just think that it appears to me that we need more than just the engineering perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=665)|
| 0:11:18| on when is a sidewalk appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| There's so much involved with that as far as destination, context, how many intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=682)|
| 0:11:31| there are, how many vehicles there are, what's the speed limit on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| All those things have to be taken into consideration along where is it in a PRZ, whether there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| going to be children trying to walk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| All those things need to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| In the city that you referenced where city engineering has discussions with planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| who is the final decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| The engineering department is, but let me say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| Right now at the city, it is the standard policy that new sidewalks will be added with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| any new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| It is the unwritten policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| And there is a policy sitting on ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| I guess Dr. Lyons is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| But there is a draft ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| But right now if the city engineering, I mean there's not many places that are as rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| as most of the county, but let's just, let's say for, that there is one that comes up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| city engineering might have a discussion with planning, but ultimately they are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| who will decide who gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| So why is that any different than what's being proposed here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Because at the city it is the standard policy that new development will include a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| For everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| No matter what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| For example, can I give you an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| So is that a policy or is that a law or a rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| It's a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Okay, so that's sort of an administrative wish, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| It's not an actual ordinance that says you must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| But there is a draft ordinance that's sitting in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| And it's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| But for years and years and years that hasn't been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| So that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| I just want to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| The discussion about the new ordinance is if it's redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| At what level of a redevelopment would it require sidewalk placement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| New development is a solid commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| So in that regard, I mean, certainly you guys have had great discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| And we're going to hear from Mr. Snowden as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| But, I mean, certainly the county is – many, many parts of the county are much, much different than many parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| Oh, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| And so have you all had discussions of, say, out in the 8th District or the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| where it's a really rural area and that somebody were to take a family farm and sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| and a subdivision would come there and it's, say, on Washington Pike or Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| that is a two-lane country road as far as the eye can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| Are you proposing that in that case that there should be both internal and external sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| where the external sidewalk might go 10 feet to the left and 10 feet to the right and end in a ditch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| What I would say is it depends on how large that subdivision is, how many vehicular trips are a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| Is it in a PRZ for both the high school, middle school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Elementary is only a mile and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| And I think those are things that would be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| I think that there's a Section D that is allowed in Section D, depending on the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=880)|
| 0:14:49| you don't have the ordinance up there, but there are exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| And then that can be – that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| I'll read the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| I guess my question is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Fee and lieu basically would be used in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| It's not worded as that, but that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| No, I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| I guess my question is my understanding of Knox County engineering is they're pretty diligent across all departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| when it comes to everything from stormwater to turn lanes to traffic studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| I mean, there is a number of different experts in departments, and they don't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| Mr. Snowden doesn't unilaterally make decisions without having consultation with his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| So is that not the same type of consultation of all the things that you said, traffic patterns, understandings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| Are they not doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| There are more variables than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| It depends on the general policy of the administration as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| and we feel that it went out that Knox County has not focused on pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| and certainly not on bicycle infrastructure at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| and certainly has not had adequate focus on getting pedestrians around safely without a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=957)|
| 0:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| But that's a policy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| But would you agree that their department does spend a tremendous amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| looking at a lot of variables before they make decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| I would assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| I would argue that Knox County is not leaving MPC out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| and that's what caused this problem to begin with is MPC took action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| and changed their minimum subdivision requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| and required sidewalks without coming to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| on an issue that has future fiscal impact and the upkeep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| We just saw earlier today that we're spending several hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| to go back and redo sidewalks to make them ADA compliant in Cedar Bluff and Ebenezer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| and we will have to maintain all sidewalks throughout all time to standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1025)|
| 0:17:14| I've heard, I've talked to Joe Green about this a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| narrowing roads to 20, 22 feet and adding a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| You know, that sounds like a good tradeoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| but what scares me is you get in these subdivisions and people have guests over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| and they start parking on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| and you get a 22-foot road with cars parked on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| and you can't get an emergency vehicle, you can't get any kind of vehicle through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| And we have no authority to regulate parking in these subdivision roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| So I trust our engineering department when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| how do we get the most practical use out of our sidewalk dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| And I often have said that the market takes care of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| If people want to live in subdivisions that have sidewalks, they'll buy in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| and builders and developers will either conform to those market demands or they'll be left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| I like the idea of spending our resources where they actually create connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| where people can walk to a commercial business or to a park or somewhere like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| I have a lot of faith in the effort that Jim Snowden and his department has put into this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| so I am going to be voting for it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Now we do want to get back to public forum, so I know there's some other folks who'd like to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| Ms. Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| Ms. Cooley, you do have two more minutes remaining. I think you only spoke for about—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| Hello. My name is Lisa Starbuck, 6233 Babley Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| I know that you all know that walking is something that we should be encouraging for people's health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| and while we do have greenways and other places for people to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| a lot of places aren't safe anymore for people to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| The mall in my area is closed, and so people who used to go walk there can't walk anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| Ten years ago, I had a friend of mine get killed while she was walking in her subdivision in Knox County with her husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1164)|
| 0:19:33| She was literally knocked out of her shoes. Her shoes were left in the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| and it killed her because they were walking in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| I agree that connectivity is important for going to the grocery store or school or other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1184)|
| 0:19:55| but that should not be the only consideration because walking in a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| even 30 minutes a day walking has been shown to have significant health benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| I think that if you put sidewalk in a subdivision, that certainly is going to encourage people to walk in their subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| as opposed to having to get in their car and drive somewhere to walk for their health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| That was basically all I had to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| I hope that you will consider other factors besides just whether or not it improves the connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1223)|
| 0:20:33| that having sidewalks in subdivisions has a lot of benefits. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you, Ms. Starbaugh. Is there another guest who would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1240)|
| 0:20:51| I'm Chris Kimball, 1225 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| I'd like to talk about costs. I hate raising taxes. First thing I think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| I went through some of the costs I saw from your cost structure, and I had a question on what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| I'm an engineer, and what the actual cost of a new sidewalk is versus a retrofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| If we put them in now on the new developments, it's a third the cost of retrofits maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| I don't know what the cost structure would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| I've run the numbers, and I came up with about $25 a linear foot for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| There was a developer that wrote in, I guess in 2017 also, and his number was $20 a linear foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| If you have 100 houses in a development, let's say, so they're going to require 1,000 car trips in a day, in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| If the frontage road has to have sidewalks, and then that main road into wherever it splits has to have sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| it ends up that maybe a third of the houses will have a sidewalk in front of them or have to pay for a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| If you take that cost structure and break it down on a 100-foot lot, it's about $350 a house to put in sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| so somebody can get out of their subdivision onto the main road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| It's a lot cheaper to do it front than after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| People need sidewalks to get where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| There's a huge crisis with diabetes right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| There was a national transportation summit in Washington, D.C. last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| The cost of diabetes has now exceeded the federal road budget, $60 billion a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| So it is an upfront cost that goes on the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| It's much cheaper to do it up front than to go back and do it later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| I'd like to see sidewalks and developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| I don't think they should be on every single street on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| It's wasting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| But at some level, there needs to be sidewalks so people can get where they're going safely and access things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| I ride my bike to work most days, and I use sidewalks some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| I use greenways some places, and I ride in the road some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| It just depends. There's a mix of how traffic is and what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| So there's not a right. You need it every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| But there's got to be options for people to get where they're going without a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| On the note of making a road wider to accommodate cars to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| that means we're paying for people to park their cars in the county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| So if we're saying that we've got to build roads wider so people can park their cars there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| we're paying for their parking spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Why are they not making the driveways deeper so that the cars have to park in the driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| and the homeowner pays for the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| That's all I've got. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Yeah, I wasn't necessarily meaning your normal day use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| I was talking about when people come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| People do have people over at their house often that exceed the number of people that you can get in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| I live on a road where we're not allowed to park on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| I'm sorry, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I live on Cherokee Boulevard. You're not allowed to park on Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| That's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Yeah, yeah, it is. But you've got to get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| If you're going to have ten people over at your house, maybe you have a carpool, maybe you have to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| But to say we're going to make the roads wider so that people can park their cars there is a huge cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| because the whole length of the road has to be wider for that one time of year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| when you're going to have ten guests over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| It's a very expensive option to make the roads wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| I'm not talking about wider than they already are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| The current 26-foot that are standard subdivision roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| Well, yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| But if they were narrower, 22, or where I live, a lot of them are 18 feet, which are really narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Does anybody else have a question for Mr. Kimball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| All right, Mr. Kimball, have you got anything else you'd like to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| Hi, Keith Briggan, 558 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| I'll just start off by quoting a passage from Compass, a local news organization, describing this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| Quote, the ordinance would be a change in the existing county regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| which have mandated sidewalks and new developments ever since the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| adopted new subdivision rules in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Developers considered that an overreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| protesting that it didn't make sense to require sidewalks that wouldn't connect to anything outside of a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| Close quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| I don't think anything there is controversial or vindictive or caustic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1542)|
| 0:25:51| Those are just plain facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| And so just based on that description, we do see who is benefiting from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| Developers benefit from this if this ordinance passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Developers are now currently responsible for building those sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| Developers are responsible for creating infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| If this ordinance passes, they no longer will be in frequent cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| That will be put back on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| That will be put back on taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| That will be put back on residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| That will make streets less walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| It will endanger small child safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| I travel to the Fifth District a lot where my in-laws live because I have triplets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| and they help me take care of them quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| We can't walk out on their road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| It's a beautiful neighborhood with some really high-quality homes, but we can't walk in that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| I can't push a stroller down that road, even though the speed limit is 25 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| I think you have to look at the long-term growth of where we're going in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| We are trying to become very attractive to large businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| that are going to attract a whole different type of resident than what we're used to having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| We're not going to be populated predominantly by retirees anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| We're going to have young people, people having kids, people that are active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| people that are moving from metropolitan areas like Atlanta, Nashville, Asheville, Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| I moved here from Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Those people are going to want to live in places where there's accessible, walkable sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| I'm not an anti-development person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| I certainly think developers provide a tremendous service to the county, to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| by building single-family and multi-family homes, but they are for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| The way you make money is by either driving up how much you sell something for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| or driving down the cost it takes you to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| That's what this is, a giveaway to make their costs lower, even though it's a nominal cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| It's a very small percentage of the sale price that goes into that infrastructure bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| I encourage you, think long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Knox County is going to get younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| It's going to get more active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| It's going to need more sidewalks, and if we don't start paying for that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| we're going to pay a lot more later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| Thank you, Mr. Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Is there anyone else who would like to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| I'm Roland Shankles, 1443 Halifax Road, Knoxville, in District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1709)|
| 0:28:38| I live in a subdivision off of Ebenezer Road over in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| I guess my point on it, I'm all in favor of more biking and more walking and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| especially for the kids that are spending time not walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| Sports are great and all that, but bicycles have been so popular with kids for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1737)|
| 0:29:07| As we talk about this, or as I've listened to folks talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| the trips that you make, whether it's walking or on a bike, start at home, generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| If it were possible to put greenways that we would drive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| and then get out of our cars and get on our bikes and bike along the greenway, well, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| We've got plenty of work to do in that area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| There's plenty of places where the greenways just stop or where there's a bike trail, but it just stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| a painted bike trail, but it just stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| But the trips that people go on, especially the kids, start at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| If we could make it so that they could perceive their subdivision as friendlier to walking or to biking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1785)|
| 0:29:54| not even considering, I guess we should be considering safety in terms of the lady that she was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1794)|
| 0:30:03| that got hit in her subdivision, and you can't prevent everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| If the width of the road would slow people down, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| Then we would not be building the speed bumps and the humps and two signs for every speed bump in subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1813)|
| 0:30:23| That doesn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| If it were possible to get people, kids as well as seniors as well as able-bodied adults, onto the sidewalks instead of in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1825)|
| 0:30:38| it seems like that would add to the safety factor throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| As you guys are talking about long-term developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| I've heard long-term maybe half a dozen times or so tonight in the discussions that have been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| anything that you do with regard to these requiring developers to put sidewalks in the subdivisions is a very long-term thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1853)|
| 0:31:05| It's not going to get junior to walk to school tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| but it's going to be a long-term thing where kids perceive the possibility of walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| and more and more they will do it, they will use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| In regard to the cost, it's got to be like one of our fellow Knox Countians said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| it's got to be considerably cheaper to do it on the front end than it is to retrofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| I don't see anything in this ordinance that talks about going back to existing subdivisions and changing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| But when you're going in with a new subdivision, if you tell me it's got to have brick fronts, then I build that into my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| I'm a CPA. I work with numbers all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| If it's got to have brick, then I build that into my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| If you tell me it's got to have a sidewalk in front of it, okay, I'm doing 50 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| I'll spread the cost of that amongst those 50 houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| and I'll change the shape of the lots to accommodate the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| If you say, no, we just want the development, our big problem is we need more development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| then you would say, okay, to heck with the sidewalks, to heck with the mailboxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Let's just get more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| But I don't think that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| The thing you're trying to encourage is more quality development countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| And from that standpoint, the ordinance is already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Why change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| If it's possible for a developer to say, the ordinance says I have to put sidewalks in my subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| can I have an exception because I either have a bad acreage or an extremely tight budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1967)|
| 0:32:56| then let him deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| But let the default be or the standard be sidewalks in subdivisions, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| That's about all I have to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Okay. All right. Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| I'm Jim Kimball, 903 Wingate, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| I'm sorry, that was Jim. What was your last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| Jim Kimball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Okay. Are you related to Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Or is that just a coincidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| I'm sorry. Same last name here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| He's the son. He's an engineer, so we're going to hear from an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| I wouldn't trust everything they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| You know what they say about playgrounds and restaurants and engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| At any rate, my point about this whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| and I've listened to Caroline preparing this ad infinitum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| is that as somebody who's lived here 38 years and used to ride my bicycle down North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| from Sequoia Hills to way out, way, way out, Saturday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| how many would want to do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| As you plop down these neighborhoods, like last time we were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| and there's 250 houses that you're plopping down somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| and what was farmland is now going to be residential and is a one-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| So the discussion with the developer is, yeah, we're going to do something about that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Well, when you plop down these subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| you don't do anything about the roads for the people that like to walk, go to their mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| There's just a big road there, and North Shore is a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| If you can imagine trying to walk along beside North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| with a bike on the edge of it or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| there's not anything that's actually being done with the density to allow people to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| and interact with one another any way than with a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| And there are two points to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| One is what somebody already said is that if you're going to attract young professional people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| they're going to want to go to a place where they can recreate out their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| So if you've ever been to Hilton Head or a place like that where there's bike paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| and you can just go right out and walk out the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| there's nothing like being able to recreate when you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| And the other thing is that by the way you're developing the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| you're condemning people to be two-car families if it's a husband and wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| You have to have a car to go anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| and the expense is a burden to a lot of people that are lower income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| And we hear a lot about low-income housing and trying to bring everyone along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| You don't bring people along with the type of infrastructure you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| The other thing I hear things about maintaining the sidewalks or that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| the streets are maintained and sidewalks and bike paths are part of complete infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| so that everyone can get around and do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| If you want to ride to the grocery store and get your groceries so you can get some cake and not get fat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| that would be nice to be able to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| If you have to create some sort of structure for doing it, like you tell the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| instead of having sidewalks through the entire, every little tiny cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| if you take an assessment from the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| and use that assessment to actually complete the sidewalks on the frontage roads to actually connect things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| later on, especially if the roads are only 22 feet, there's room for sidewalks or dirt paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| I hear a lot of people saying connect the cul-de-sacs just with dirt greenways, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| But this is not being done in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| There's no connectivity at all, virtually at all, to parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| Everybody drives to any park you go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| There's almost nowhere you can just walk to or ride your bike anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| And every time you take these developments and plop them down, you're further down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| So for me, it's a quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| For you, it's an issue of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| But I tell you to be creative, and you maintain these streets and these cul-de-sacs, these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| the sidewalks and the easements, the frontage roads, the bike paths, all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| that is part of infrastructure that, as a county, you should be in charge of seeing that everyone is accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| Low income, people want to exercise, people don't want to drive everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| all kinds of reasons to do it, not just the cheapest way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| And there are cheaper ways to build sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| There are cheaper ways to build roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| All these things about narrow roads are true, and if you walk beside a road where people are driving 45 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| on a sidewalk attached to the curb, it's really unpleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| I mean, it's something a lot of people do because they don't have a car, but it's not what you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| it's just not the way to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| So I'm looking to y'all to come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| And the engineers have been telling us for years, y'all tell us what to build and we build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| And it's like, well, no, you're supposed to have a complete street so that people can recreate right out of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| It's not a pipe dream, and it's within your grasp to do things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| Be creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| Thank you, Mr. Kimball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Our next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| I'm speaking in my capacity as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| I want to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| I'm a little surprised to see the administration bring forth this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| I've heard a lot from Mayor Jacobs about, as they've talked about growth and development and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| I've heard a lot about the importance where he says it's for fiscal responsibility that it's important for development to pay its fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2304)|
| 0:38:34| This ordinance, the way it's written, which doesn't really require a lot of sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| it gives it a lot of latitude to engineering and public works, but it doesn't put that requirement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| And we know that I've been in meetings where developers have pushed and they've tried to get out of as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| And this is really developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| One argument that's been brought up is this is development trying to lower their cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| and then that puts the cost of adding these sidewalks in across all the taxpayers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| I'm really against what the administration said, where they want development to pay their fair share of building that infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| So I'm a little surprised there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I'm also echoing, I'm surprised the previous speaker brought up the point that this is the kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| sidewalks are something that people expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| It's table stakes for bringing in young people, professionals, the people that we want to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Sidewalks make a place a good place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| I've heard the mayor talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| He wants to have these positive attributes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| And I really think that this is something that sidewalks, this is kind of basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| I'm kind of surprised we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| I was messaging with some friends of mine, and they're younger and runners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| and I told them I was going to come to this meeting and that there was going to probably be some opposition putting sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| Their quote was that this is a disservice to society by putting in new development that doesn't require sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2395)|
| 0:40:03| Finally, I want to address Commissioner Jay, you brought up Washington Pike, Haswell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| So I'm going to actually bring up the real-life scenario of if I apply this ordinance to developing my farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| My farm sits on Washington Pike and Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| Those are highly traveled streets, and there's a portion of it that would lie within the parental responsibility zone for Rita Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| So you might have to put some sidewalks in on Washington Pike there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| But the rest of this frontage area wouldn't require sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| The developer put in sidewalks on Washington Pike, wouldn't require it on Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| Now, I have people that walk all the time from the subdivisions up Murphy Road that didn't put sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| They walk along the side of the road with 9,000 cars a day on that road, two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| They walk up to the Weigel's or the Dollar General or the restaurant to actually participate in some of the services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| I have people that would like to walk out Washington Pike, but that's a zero-foot shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| since the county doesn't actually own the land underneath Washington Pike there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Instead, they trespass and go through my property along the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| So I have to call the sheriff and the railroad police once a month or so to let them know that there are people trespassing because they're using that as a route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| This ordinance, if it was a bit stronger and actually required developers to put in sidewalks along those external roads, that would be a huge help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2476)|
| 0:41:26| And that really should be table stakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| It encourages running, biking, and makes it a good place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| So that's my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Any other folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| My name is Alex Palowski, 1312 Judy Reagan Lane, County District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| Commissioner, I'd like to address some of the comments you all have made so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| Commissioner Smith, you made the point that developers will follow the desires of those where they want to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| And in some points, I kind of agree with that aspect of the overall thing, that developers read the trends that happen of how people want to live and where they want to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2513)|
| 0:42:05| However, as anyone that has tried to potentially buy property in more walkable neighborhoods like Sequoia Hills, West Hills, other places, good luck finding a place in there sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2525)|
| 0:42:18| And as a recent graduate of UT myself, I just graduated my graduate degree, I spent a lot of time at Oak Ridge National Lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2538)|
| 0:42:27| And so my roommates and I, we split time between Oak Ridge and university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| So as you can imagine, moving to where we did on Middlebrook and Joe Hinton, it's a great – there were multiple aspects to how we chose to move where we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2551)|
| 0:42:42| And in our particular case, the house that we had was a great level of commute and decent commute times between those two places, as well as access to grocery stores and other things, and greenways as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2562)|
| 0:42:54| And as someone that has biked a lot of times to Hardin Valley from our house, having that access of having a sidewalk is a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2574)|
| 0:43:06| In our particular neighborhood, we have a sidewalk that was built through the multiplex houses that are in between us and Middlebrook that were probably built back in the 80s or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2586)|
| 0:43:17| And it's a great way for people to walk to and from the grocery store – sorry, Pilot and the gas station there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| But when you get to our neighborhood, there are no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| And luckily, our neighborhood is filled with some very awesome, fearing people that walk anyways despite not having access to sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2609)|
| 0:43:41| But when you have cars that are parked rightfully in front of their house or, as you said, guests in your house, that situation at night while walking your dog –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2621)|
| 0:43:52| a very simple activity that everyone that owns a dog has to do – becomes a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| And not having – I mean, I feel like this is really low-hanging fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| I mean, we're talking, what, $300 per developer in certain situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| Maybe it's more, maybe it could be as much as $1,000, whatever, depending on what the type is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| I don't really see how the current developer community has had a real issue with this original –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| or the MPC's move to make this a possibility with requiring at least some kind of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2661)|
| 0:44:28| or at least the consultation of whether sidewalks should be placed there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| And so I – and then finally, one thing I'd like to say, too, is I know that there is an aversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| Anytime that you make something new in infrastructure, you're now responsible for maintaining the infrastructure moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2678)|
| 0:44:47| But in a lot of ways, we already maintain – we maintain roads, we maintain all these other things inside these subdivisions once they've taken over by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2687)|
| 0:44:58| And it seems kind of a disservice to residents in the county that choose to live in the county and come here for work and prosper to not have the ability to use sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2698)|
| 0:45:10| because it seems like maintaining sidewalks is a negative, whereas maintaining roads is a good thing, positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| And emergency vehicle situation aside, it doesn't seem to me, at least in my opinion, fair to kind of make that big distinction between a road and a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2718)|
| 0:45:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| If I could point out one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Yes, Commissioner Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| When we talk about maintenance of roads, that is paid by gas tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| There is no walking tax or biking tax to help maintain greenways and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| Maybe that's something, I don't know, we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| But the road resurfacing and all that is paid through gas tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Yeah, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| But I would contend that everyone who pays gas tax walks as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| So I feel like that's past part of the activity of walking from the car and other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| So respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Is there anybody else who would also like to speak on this subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| As far as gas tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Well, Ms. Cooley, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| I know there's another gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| I try to recognize people in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I just wanted to say that local roads are funded by local funding primarily, not by the gas tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| Gas tax funds federal roads and state roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Jim, you can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| It's always money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Our department is funded by local option sales tax and gas tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| So, yeah, both are combined to fund both local roads and collectors and arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Sir, if you could please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| I'm Thomas Egan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| I live at 2715.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| I'm sorry, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Thomas Egan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| I live at 2715 South Haven Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| I'll keep it short and sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| You know, basically, I'm one of the young people that likes to recreate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| I have no sidewalk in front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| You know, the city's going through a sidewalk study right now that costs I don't know how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| But there's a problem in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| And I think that, you know, doing something like this isn't beneficial to the future pedestrian mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2840)|
| 0:47:31| And, you know, as people have stated again and again, it just makes sense cost-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| So please really consider the way you vote this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Is there anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| My name is Gene Fitzhugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| I'm on the faculty at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I live at 560 Riverfront Way in the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| I'm a physical activity epidemiologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| I teach a course on the volume of physical activity people need to lower their risk for diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| Tonight, you've got some great information about Tennessee, diabetes, depression, a variety of different diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2890)|
| 0:48:21| Thirty percent of all of those diseases could be prevented and reduced here in Knox County if adults were to walk 150 minutes per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2901)|
| 0:48:35| Three out of ten cases of disease would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| My specific research area is in the built environment and physical activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| trying to figure out how people interact with where they live and the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| We know that if you have a sidewalk near your house, going by your house, you're four times more likely to meet that 150-minute guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2933)|
| 0:49:08| If you do not have a sidewalk, you're pretty well certain, according to data that I've gleaned from Knox County, to be sedentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2948)|
| 0:49:18| Now, currently, seven out of ten Knox County adults do not get the recommended level of physical activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2958)|
| 0:49:26| One great intervention that a community could do is to mandate sidewalks with the new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2966)|
| 0:49:36| I support that approach to helping enable people to be active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| We're talking about lowering the health care costs for the county, for your citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| We're looking at social capital increasing for neighborhoods, and we're looking at just a more attractive place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2990)|
| 0:49:58| So I encourage you to think about the long-term health of the people of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| because it will have a cost-benefit for the quality of life, people living longer, and higher quality of years lived longer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3004)|
| 0:50:21| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| I just want to make some comments. I'll wait to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| No, I know who's speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| I can make my comments now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Because I appreciate all of the comments associated with the quality of life in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| Amy, you have to leave. I've got some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3037)|
| 0:50:46| Sorry about that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Sorry, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| I do appreciate the quality of life comments. I do appreciate the health disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| I do appreciate the capacity for the direction the county is trying to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| But in all the comments I've heard, we still have not addressed the issue of the accessibility for the public at large in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3059)|
| 0:51:10| needs to be on the public infrastructure and the larger capacity for people to be able to access the public intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3070)|
| 0:51:20| These are subdivisions that require sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| But nowhere have any of the comments that I've heard talk about making the accessibility greater for all of the people in the county and not just in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3083)|
| 0:51:35| We speak of subdivision-related sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| But I have not heard any support for the public accessibility so that large-scale people in the county to be able to access large-scale public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3099)|
| 0:51:54| So we're specifically saying maintain them in the subdivision where people opt to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| But not one comment in support of saying we need to improve the public infrastructure so large amounts of people can access public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3120)|
| 0:52:10| Because we don't want to hear the whole conversation the county needs to have about a tax increase in order to maintain the public's infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3130)|
| 0:52:20| We speak solely of infrastructure within specific subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| But not infrastructure so that large-scale people can be able to move safely throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3146)|
| 0:52:35| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| I know we're still in a public forum, but I also want to recognize I know Commissioner Daley had a question for Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| By the way, just by a show of hands, who else in the public in our audience tonight would also like to speak to this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3162)|
| 0:52:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Sir, I think you already, have you already spoken on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Then I will recognize Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| We can get back to you, but I do want to give the commissioners a chance if they have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Amy, you should have left 30 minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| For us that don't know, some do, some don't, what is the process if I've got 100 acres of land or 20 acres of land and I want to do a development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3191)|
| 0:53:20| Right now, there is no county policy on sidewalks inside the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| What is KKP's thought process of sidewalks inside a subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3204)|
| 0:53:33| Well, as was mentioned earlier, within our Knoxville-Knox County subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| there is a provision in there that states that sidewalks shall be required in all subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3219)|
| 0:53:47| And so we take that into consideration when anyone submits an application for a subdivision and we will review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| And typically, we would require sidewalks on at least one side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| That's in the county regulations now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| In the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| So Cherokee Landing, I don't think, has sidewalks in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| Why did they not have sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| I can't speak to that specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| Cherokee Landing in front of South Doyle High School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| I don't think they've got sidewalks in there, do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| This provision is relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I believe it was 2017 is when our planning commission inserted it into the subdivision regulations in terms of the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3264)|
| 0:54:32| And then delayed the implementation for about a year, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Yes, and then they delayed it for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Okay, so I guess that's all I've got for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| That will lead me to Mr. Snowden when he gets his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| Thank you, Amy, for staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| I suspect that Mr. Snowden is probably there are people waiting to ask you questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| but I also do want to give you a chance to comment on this subject in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| If you'd entertain, I gave Drusilla a jump drive with a few PDF documents on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| that I think would kind of give us a good indication of kind of where we were and where we'd like to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| Based on our conversation last week, the first slide there is a graphical representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| There was some conversation about whether or not a quarter mile or a half mile should be the relative distance used to kind of define that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| So what we decided to do is try to use something that everybody's familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| and that's this room we're standing in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| And what do we think, because statistics show that the half mile, quarter mile, that's about the limit of where a person will walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3337)|
| 0:55:46| Well, we decided, well, which one should it be, because there was some question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| And we just kind of looked at it and decided, well, if you're in this building and you want to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| where do we think would be the longest point someone would want to walk and then turn around and come back because it's a round trip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| And we looked at two different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| The half mile is all the way in the old city, one way from this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| The quarter mile is the high place or the movie theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| We kind of looked at that, looked at the cost associated with building the additional quarter mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| and to be quite honest with you, we felt like that the quarter mile was the more appropriate distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| based on what we would anticipate to be the average trip and the associated cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| The next slide there, if you don't care to conceal it, is this is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| What we tried to do was look at locations, existing locations, that if this ordinance was passed, would be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3400)|
| 0:56:50| I feel like some of these folks that have spoke tonight maybe think that we're maybe not in favor of general sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| That's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| We want to use sidewalks in locations where they're strategic and they benefit the most people rather than isolated internal to subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3419)|
| 0:57:10| In this case is one everybody's familiar with, and I meant to bring a laser pointer and I didn't, so my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| At the top of the screen is Kingston Pike and Ted Russell Ford, and that is suburban road that is highlighted there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3437)|
| 0:57:26| and connects over to Gleason Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| That is a roadway that we get a lot of complaints about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| It is a roadway that serves as what we would consider a neighborhood collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| It connects two collector roadways that has relatively higher traffic volumes and relatively higher traffic speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| That's a location that if this subdivision were to come in today, we would require that highlighted route to have sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| because we feel like on a 26-foot wide street with those volumes and the trips that are most likely not residents in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3471)|
| 0:58:00| they're people cutting through, they may not anticipate those pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| We want to have sidewalks in locations like that, and this ordinance would allow us to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| The next slide is a location not far from that one on Bluegrass Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| As you can see on the left-hand side of the screen, there was a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| I think it's Milford or something like that. I can't remember the name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| It's relatively small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| It went in probably eight or ten years ago, and there were sidewalks installed in the interior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| but there wasn't any sidewalks installed along the frontage of what is Bluegrass Road that is within the PRZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| This ordinance, if proposed and approved, would eliminate the red lines, as you see them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| and require the developer to install the purple line along the frontage of Bluegrass Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| What we think that would do is we don't have a project at this location right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| However, if somebody can build essentially that much sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| that flips the cost-benefit for the county to where we can go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| and probably fill in some of those gaps a lot easier than we normally otherwise would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| So that's a location that we think would be a primary benefit if this ordinance was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| The next one, I think we're getting close to the end here. I don't want to take up too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| I know it's been a long evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| This is on North Shore Drive. I know the map's kind of grown out to scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| Essentially, at the north there at the top of the page where the green is, that's the cove at Concord Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| At the bottom is a neighborhood commercial node of a Weigel's restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| Obviously, these subdivisions were built before that neighborhood commercial node was created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| so some of this is a little bit dynamic, but we wanted to show this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| If these subdivisions came in today and that node existed, both Montgomery Cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| it has a significant amount of frontage on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Jefferson Park has a significant amount of frontage on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Actually, there's another subdivision that's relatively small. It has frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| That purple line would be constructed by the developer for the use of all those residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| and then only that small section from the purple line to the green park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| would be something that the county would have to fill in the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| We feel like that's a good use of developer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| and a wise use of taxpayer dollars to leverage those forces together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| The last slide we had is essentially just a couple of pictures of 26-foot wide residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3642)|
| 1:00:52| We like the fact that those streets are relatively wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| I would argue that width of road doesn't have as much to do with speed as maybe some would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3656)|
| 1:01:08| Even a rural road, people travel very fast on if they can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| I think line of sight is what drives people's behavior in regard to speed, not width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| We would like to keep the 26-foot wide road because we think it allows for parking that's going to be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3680)|
| 1:01:28| but also provides that multimodal use that there's no evidence or crash data to support it being a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3688)|
| 1:01:39| There just isn't data to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| As you can see from both these images, I don't feel like it's unsafe for a pedestrian to walk on that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3701)|
| 1:01:50| Now, if that road connects two busy roads, we think it needs to have a sidewalk, and this ordinance addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3710)|
| 1:01:58| I just wanted this body to know that my department considered this very cautiously and carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| looking at factors such as pedestrian safety, but also looking at the long-term financial impact to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| We feel like what this ordinance does is a good marriage between those two, and we would ask for your support in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3730)|
| 1:02:19| I'll certainly be happy to entertain any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| but hopefully some of these pictures and descriptions were helpful in your decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3741)|
| 1:02:32| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Mr. Snowden, just a couple of clarifying points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| What in today's standards that are specified in this ordinance would be the width of the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3762)|
| 1:02:49| Five feet minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Okay, five feet minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Do you agree with the analysis from a couple of our speakers that the cost is about roughly $25 a linear foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| We have issued three different solicitations, the lowest of which is $55 a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3781)|
| 1:03:10| Now, there may be contractors that can do it for less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| but do they have the bonds and insurance that the county's procurement office is going to want to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| Obviously not, because we, like I said, and I can certainly provide that documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| but the three bids we've issued, because we get complaints all the time from developers that our bond amounts are too high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| so we want to help those guys as much as we can, so we've issued multiple solicitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| and the cheapest we've came back with is $55 a linear feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| And is that, like, usually a minimum number that they would have to come in and do, like, 100 feet or 200 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| Yeah, and that's part of the problem is they don't know how much they're going to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| so they are setting that price at a point that probably covers both the small and the large projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| And then another question came up, and I guess you could kind of, I don't know if I could maybe use the back of this as a visualization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3846)|
| 1:04:15| Let's say this is the shape of the property and it's 50 acres, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| This is the corridor along here, and over here there's vacant property, vacant property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3861)|
| 1:04:29| but over here you've got a subdivision and subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| If you've got a center road here coming into the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| would you only require the sidewalk to go from that point over to connect to these subdivisions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| You'd make them the whole distance of the five, let's say it's 500 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| Yes, if any part of that 50-acre frontage falls within these requirements, quarter mile, PRZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3887)|
| 1:04:56| he bills it the entire frontage of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| And then the other issue that was brought up with one of our constituents was that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| we don't really identify where the nearest, the next schools are going to be because we have no master plan to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| so how do you know when you approve that subdivision that's not really going to be in the parental zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| where they would require sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| And, you know, that's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| I mean, we don't know where those things are going to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| and we work with Russ and his folks to try to, you know, in their site selection process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| but that's a risk that we are going to have, that there may be locations that we just don't have that crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3932)|
| 1:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| And then, thank you, and then I had a question for Mr. Shankles, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3941)|
| 1:05:52| And we talked on the phone about a week, 10 days ago, something like that, maybe two weeks ago, whatever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| I can't remember the time frame, and we covered a lot of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| and I'm trying to remember if it was actually you that brought up this excellent point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| in that you and the biking community and the walking community were against changing this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| and as you can see by tonight how many people you had show up in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| but I think it was you or possibly somebody else that brought up the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| and they said, well, you're changing this in benefit of the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| You know, are the developers coming to speak in favor of this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| And I'm not sure if you were the one that said it or not, but I thought that was an excellent point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| because here you're saying keep it the status quo, but yet we want to change the ordinance in favor of the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| but a representative for the developers is not here to say, yeah, we need to have this changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| I don't know how the ordinance was originally passed that the subdivision had to have sidewalks in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4009)|
| 1:06:58| but now to have an ordinance that says let's take the sidewalks out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| in my mind goes back to, and I'm not trying to have some straw man developer, like some stereotypical developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| They're all as different as we are, but to have minimum requirements for those developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4031)|
| 1:07:19| so that they're weighing the full cost of what they're doing in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| I'm not saying they have to go in and build a new school or they have to put in wastewater treatment sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| but to say you've got to make your area, you've got to build it into your budget to make that area as resident friendly as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4051)|
| 1:07:43| It would be wonderful, hallelujah, if we could make the subdivisions connect to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| and to the low commercial areas for restaurants and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| That would be terrific, but as far as the developer is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| to put the full cost of what he's doing to the community onto him or her makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4078)|
| 1:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Smith, or that's Commissioner Gill's line, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Jim, for explaining or having examples about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| because I've lived in communities in Vestal on Spruce Drive that had no sidewalks, no shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4103)|
| 1:08:32| nothing but a narrow road and a ditch, and I presently live in a community with full sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| I'm not against sidewalks, but I certainly want public dollars in the public realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| to benefit the public connectivity so that the accessibility for large amounts of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| to be able to safely cross our roads to be our priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| And I agree, the county is changing, and we begin to think that there are winners and losers to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| but I see the argument to look not only at the larger conversation about sidewalk connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4144)|
| 1:09:15| that is driving this process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| So I appreciate your examples you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Yeah, this is admittedly a very tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| We've all gotten a lot of communication, a great turnout tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| Sometimes some of the parts that I personally am struggling with on this is we've also heard very different points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| as it relates to sidewalks inside of neighborhoods and outside of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| and I've talked to some folks in my district, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| At a glance, when you say there's a sidewalk ordinance out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| I can't imagine anybody that would say they're against sidewalks or making any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| I mean, that's the at-a-glance take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| But then when you come down to what are we doing around increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| I think the current sidewalk ordinance doesn't have anything towards connectivity of neighborhoods and regions, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4201)|
| 1:10:11| So, I mean, if you wave a magic wand, you have both where you've got sidewalks in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| and connectivity within neighborhood to neighborhood and all those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| Sometimes, Jim, to your point about this quarter-mile piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| that's the one thing I'm wanting to get out and drive some roads and get a better feel for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| because the chickens are out of the barn on some of the roads that we looked at up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| And how do we really look at the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Because it's going to be, I noticed on the example on North Shore, those roads, those lots are likely, I guess, undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| or they may be floodplains, the ones that are on the opposite side of the road, or maybe they just haven't been sold yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| But I guess it would be great if they got developed and had all that front footage put in to connect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| But I do admit that part of where I struggle a little bit in a downtown or urban area, that does seem like a long walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4262)|
| 1:11:09| But if I'm trying to get from my house to go down to another spot, Tracy and I wouldn't have a problem going a half mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4269)|
| 1:11:19| So I'll admit that this is one I'm still kind of trying to digest right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| But those are really some of the things before us is internal connectivity, not versus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| but internal connectivity and external connectivity and trying to find that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4291)|
| 1:11:39| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| I want to thank everyone for coming out because we've had ordinances, public meetings that no one showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| that we changed zonings that really affected everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| So I am so proud that you all showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| I'll be honest with you, I expected maybe four or five to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| Along with the chairman, if I heard him correctly, the quarter of a mile to me sounds too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4328)|
| 1:12:18| You know, I just went to KGIS while we were all talking and went to the IC King Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| and put in a quarter of a mile, which is only 800, right around 800 feet, all that is, quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| No, 1,300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| 1,300 feet for a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| It didn't take up very much at all, that quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4356)|
| 1:12:46| With the 26-foot roads that we will require, hopefully we're requiring 26-foot roads inside our subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4366)|
| 1:12:55| I agree with you that that's, especially in dead-end subdivisions like Graybrook, Cherokee Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| Wood Reserve, Wood Haven, Tipton, all those, those are dead-end subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| Kids are out there playing in the road now and riding their bicycles, which is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| My concern, like the chairman's, is that it may ought to be farther than a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| That's the developers, that's not us having to pay that extra quarter of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| that's the developer having to pay that extra quarter of a mile for the road front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| And I believe Commissioner Gill, if I'm on the same page as Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| that let's get that sidewalk out in front of the frontage road, on the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| to where more people can use those sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| And where am I, since you mentioned me, as I understand some of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| it's that quarter of a mile, it's the quarter of a mile from an area that would generate visits, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| It's not just putting front-footed sidewalks for the sake of front-footed sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| It's more of, you know, what are we trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| Also, how do you define a foot traffic collector, if that's the right way to describe a center that might generate traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| I mean, I'm thinking this will probably be discussed next week, this one's not going to go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| but that might be some extra clarification for us to talk about next week when we move on to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| Because I admit, if you've got truly a subdivision in the middle of nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| does it make sense to have front footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| Well, maybe it doesn't, because it's not within a quarter of a mile or a half mile from something that's going to collect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| So I kind of want to get, I know we've talked about it, but that may warrant some additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| If you guys would like to see any more examples or specifics of examples, we'll certainly put those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| We just, you know, we want to throw you out some examples of what we were thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| You know what would also be helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| You know, even one of our best zoning experts on this panel is Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| And, you know, I've said one of, but he had to ask a clarifying question about the way the current zoning exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4501)|
| 1:15:11| It's not the right word, but the way the current ordinance exists on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| What might be helpful to this body would be to have a chart of maybe just a little bit more cleared out, black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4517)|
| 1:15:26| kind of here's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| If these changes happen, this is what it would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Maybe in language that even Hugh Nystrom could even understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| And that's pretty simple language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| So just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| We'll definitely be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Essentially what we're trying, what we would like to do if this is approved, this ordinance would go into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| and then we would ask MPC to revise their subregs to reflect the exact language that is codified within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4546)|
| 1:15:54| as it relates to sidewalks on city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| But we can provide all that information to you guys in an email this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| And I do want to, I recognize two more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| Sir, you wanted to make one last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| I do want to acknowledge that you expressed that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Then we'll come back to the commissioners and then wrap this meeting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Jim Kimball again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| So the connectivity is, I did address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| That's a big part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| And one of the things that y'all are debating is getting rid of, you're debating getting rid of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| so that there are no sidewalks required anymore except as maybe somebody should like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| And one of the points I made was nothing's connected now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| You're not connecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| So maybe you should do something creative like right now the ordinance is you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| the developers have to put sidewalks in all the new developments and the frontage road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| and the distance you're debating now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| There's discussion about whether or not you need sidewalks in the entire development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| but there's certainly a need for connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| So if you had an assessment of the developers for the amount that they would be putting sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| if they did it under the current ordinance through the entire development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| and used engineering to say, okay, we're only going to do it here and here and here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| and the rest of the money goes into developing a greenway, an infrastructure, a minimum grid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| so people can go from point A to point B, big neighborhood connectors to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| parental responsibility zones and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| So you have this ordinance rather than just doing away with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| why don't you do something creative with it like the TIFs and pilots and all that stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| and try to collect the money to have the developers actually build the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| for neighborhoods where people would like to live and can afford to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| I recognize Commissioner Carringer, then Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Yeah, I've been here tonight, and I want to say thank you to everybody who has stayed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| And this is an important topic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| I tried to listen to everybody and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| And I want to say, along with Kevin Murphy, on Murphy Road I'll use some differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4678)|
| 1:18:06| We have Shannon Valley subdivision that has sidewalks in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| They have a pool and they have a clubhouse and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| And, I mean, there's always children in strollers and walking their dogs and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| and that was definitely needed in that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| because I can't imagine they were all on the street trying to get there and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| Then across you have Semeroe subdivision that doesn't have any sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| And since that, and plus you have the Montessori School and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| and then we have some condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| Since those were put in, now up at the corner we have a nice Weigel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| and you have the Dollar General store and you have a pizza place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| you have a drug store up on Washington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| So where one subdivision has got the sidewalks to get to Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| Semeroe's doesn't have it, and then there's nothing for them to go down Murphy Road on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| I mean, you're taking your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| There's a hill, there's the railroad track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| so you're taking your life into your own hands there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| However, then in my subdivision where now everyone's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| well, I wish we had sidewalks, we can't add them because we have underground utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| So that would have been something more proactive on the beginning, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| and so now we're in the county so there's no lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| and if people don't have their street lights on, it is so dark out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| Now earlier, now we have, you know, people out walking their dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| and I mean literally you can be doing 10, 15 miles per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| which is legal there in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| and really almost run over people because you're out there on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| especially with it getting darker a lot sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| So then I have a daughter who lives in Kesterbrook, and they have sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| and it's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| I mean, it's straight up the hill, you know, and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| So, you know, I definitely do see a need in that, particularly in our health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| I mean, I do feel like a lot more people get out there in Kesterbrook and Shannon Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| and walk their babies in their strollers and kids and all because they do have the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| and they feel a little safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| But there's no way I'd get out on Murphy Road and try to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| I mean, I'm even afraid in my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Most of our places in Tazewell Park, I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| So, you know, I see the subdivisions on Tazewell Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| and we have the Wii course right there or the golfing there for kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| and we had a car run up into the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| And I see that increasing, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| I mean, we've got all these subdivisions, but they have no way of getting over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| So it is an issue that I think Knox County, and I know Jim is taking it very serious too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| that we do know younger people are moving into Knoxville because it is a great place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| and they are going to look for those extras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| And so if it's somehow where, you know, developers can take this on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| and the affordability, I think, is a whole lot of it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| With younger couples and kids and all, how much more they can pay for their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| and have these nice amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| But it is what our young people are pretty much demanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| and wanting these days in order to keep them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| And so I just want everybody to know that I am very concerned about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| and thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| And I think this commission takes it serious too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| and I hope that there's something we can work out that's a win-win for everybody in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| to make it better to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| All right, thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Mr. Snowden, is there a scenario in which, let's take something on Washington Pike or Tazeville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4927)|
| 1:22:16| I mean, any sort of more rural road in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| Is there a scenario in which you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| you might recommend during this process to somebody trying to develop a piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| the frontage doesn't connect anywhere, so it's a sidewalk to nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| but is there a scenario in which you would recommend, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| you're in a particular land or slope or setup where we would recommend the interior ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| Would you ever recommend interior ones, interior sidewalks to a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| or is that truly a sort of market-based?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Is this really all about connectivity on the frontage side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| I think it is market-based, and I think if we start putting in that situation where it doesn't serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| it's really just to serve the residents that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| That becomes what I would consider more of an amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| and I don't know, I kind of struggle with whether or not the taxpayer should pay for that amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| I mean, we're allowing them to, Covered Bridge is a good example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| They have a pedestrian walking trail that goes around their subdivision that's off the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5006)|
| 1:23:33| and we would certainly permit that, but they maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| They use it for their recreation, but it's off the right-of-way and not maintained by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| and I think that intuitively makes sense because they're the only ones using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| so why should the taxpayer be required to maintain that when it's just for their specific use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| That's almost like their pool or any other amenity that they would have for their residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| And then another scenario I was just thinking about, let's say subdivision X is built with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5040)|
| 1:24:07| Are there any codes, ordinances, or other things to prevent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| Again, as soon as that road and that sidewalk are turned over, it becomes our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| Let's say a property owner plants a big oak tree right on the edge of the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| and it rips up the sidewalk, and there's roots everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Are there ordinances and codes about what you can do internally that would prevent us from having to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5066)|
| 1:24:34| to maintain a broken sidewalk, or is that where it gets really blurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| because now you're regulating what somebody does on their land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| It does get blurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| Anytime you work within the right-of-way, you're technically required to give us a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| but most people, if they're setting out landscaping or irrigation or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| they don't necessarily contact our office, so we don't have a record of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| So I think it would be very difficult to try to police that right-of-way interior to subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5102)|
| 1:25:10| whereas on outer streets it's a little bit easier for us just because of the nature in which utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5110)|
| 1:25:18| and other people install facilities in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| And then I just have two final questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| Let's take Murphy Road, for example, and Mr. Murphy's talking about how you've got lots of developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| but then they're trying to walk down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| That would essentially be an opportunity for us, for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| to put in a greenway or sidewalk that we felt would produce everybody's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| It doesn't really have to do with inside of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| It's more of what we feel like is infrastructure for the greater county, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| And there's, you know, you've got Y goals and the Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| You've got a lot of commercial nodes out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| So as, you know, in Mr. Murphy's example, if his piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| or a similar piece of property nearby was developed, we would require that frontage sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| so that people in, you know, Shannon Valley Farms and Murphy or another one Michelle mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| they could access those facilities much safer than they currently do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| But right now, let's say Mr. Murphy did not want to sell his land and develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| He's happy to have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| In order for us to create that connectivity and put in a greenway or sidewalk down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| do we have to buy right away from Mr. Murphy and other property owners to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| if we decided that was a capital project we wanted to install?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| Most likely, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Most of the projects we do, we buy just enough right away for the necessity of the existing alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| And once that alignment changes or gets modified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| we would typically need to, you know, purchase additional right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| As we wrap up, Jim, I've got one quick question, then I promise I'll adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| As it current stands, as I understand it, our current sidewalk ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| as I said, a lot of what we've talked about tonight is sidewalks inside of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| and sidewalks outside of neighborhoods related to connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| But as I understand it, our current sidewalk ordinance does not have any teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| or language as it relates to external connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| or anything about making any kind of front footage on collector streets or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| That's not in the code anywhere at all, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| That is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| I would need to look at that a little closer and confer with Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| But that's my understanding correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| It's primarily internal streets only and somewhat excludes the external connectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| So the only place where that language kind of exists, at least in this proposed version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| Just wanted to – I wasn't sure I wanted to – that would be if Amy could please follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| up and look at what we have in our current code about any kind of external connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| I don't think that's clear with this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| So that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| We'll certainly get you a clear picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Do my fellow commissioners have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467200121publichearings?start=5293)|
