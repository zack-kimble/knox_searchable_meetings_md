| 0:05:55| who would like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=355)|

| 0:06:00| have some exciting new visions and would like some time to understand that more fully before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| we consider the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=365)|

| 0:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| My preference would be I'd let this go to its regular part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| I've got some questions I'd like to ask tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| And when you do things at the beginning of the meeting, those are for the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| are just a cursory once over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| So my preference is to let it go to its normal place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| So the motion on the floor is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| The discussion has been joined by Ms. Frost, who said he'd like to at least go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Councilman Hawquist, and then I'll come back to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Well, from a parliamentary standpoint, I think we need to withdraw right now and then make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| the motion after it comes up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| So I'll withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=409)|

| 0:07:49| Knox County Public Library's outdoor movie series will start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=469)|

| 0:07:56| The first date is this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| It's at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| And the first one is the Kevin Costner baseball classic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Field of Dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| And it starts right about dusk, which should be about 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| And it's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| But you might want to bring a lawn chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| And I want to congratulate and thank everybody that did such an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| outstanding job for the city of Knoxville over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| You know, when you have a back-to-back football game that brings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| 100,000 people and then Booms Day, which brings in 400,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| day after day, it means a lot of work from fire and police and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| public safety workers and our engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| You don't get that many people in and out of town without a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| lot of work by people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| And we're really grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| And I think it was a great weekend for our city to show off in a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| And I want to thank all the employees who helped make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| And I think that's it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| Ms. Peelum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Well, Mayor Haslam, I think some of us were able to enjoy today a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| groundbreaking that has been a long time in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Perhaps you'll want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| But I just rejoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| After almost eight years on this council, and it seems to me it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| around seven years ago that that idea was floating about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| And then due to your leadership and the leadership of those on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| council, it appears that Menville is going to become the home to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| homeless folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| And hopefully some lives will be changed and enriched and challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| And hopefully they can move on to much better places and we can then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| continue to bring into that location those folks who so need some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| And I just want to thank you and your administration for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| leadership you've shown in making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| And we also were able to preserve a lovely architectural feature for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| And thanks for council's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| That has been a long, hard journey, but finally breaking ground today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| was a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| And hopefully we're well on our way to adding that housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Other reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| If I have it on my calendar correctly, and somebody in council probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| knows this one way or the other, correct me if I'm wrong, but tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Wednesday the 9th at 4.30 p.m. at the LT Ross building, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| follow-up review meeting on the public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| That's parking and yards ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| So I think that's something worth announcing, the LT Ross building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| in Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| So give us the date and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| It's LT Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| It's tomorrow at 4.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Public meeting to review the ordinance that was passed three months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| four months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| That's a good note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Councilman Villalobos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Well, Councilman Holquist's comments made me remember that on, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| believe it is Wednesday evening at West High School at 7.30, there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| be a forum for the candidates who will be running for the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| council seat, which will be, that election will be in November, early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| voting, I believe it's the 22nd of September, and then the election in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| So for those who are listening out there and those who are here, it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| great opportunity to hear the three candidates who are running for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| council seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| West High School, 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| That's a good note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Okay, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| 8A is a resolution reappointing Richard Jantz to serve as a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Citizens Advisory Committee to the Knoxville Area Transit Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| requested by Councilmember Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| 10A is an appeal by Ion Kocan of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| deny the request for a variance to reduce the north side yard setback from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| 12 feet to 10 feet as per site plan to add a two-story addition to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| one-story residence in an R1 low-density residential district property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| located at 5616 Wallwood Road, in conjunction with Resolution 11R, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| is a resolution approving the appeal by Mr. Kocan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| We do have, let's see, Mr. Kocan is here, and I'm assuming wants to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| to this, and since he is in favor of the appeal, he would speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| So, Mr. Kocan, if you can come down front, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| We do have Mr. Mayor, nobody is required to speak, though, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| Nobody is required to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Mr. Kocan, I made an assumption that you wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| If you don't want to, you do not have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Signed up to speak against is Mr. Dan Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=780)|
| 0:13:13| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| I'm Dan Kidd, 5622 Wallwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| I live two doors down from Mr. Kocan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Since he didn't speak, I won't take up much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| The last time I think we were here, Councilman Frost encouraged Mr. Kocan and I to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| and try to resolve this without the council having to take some action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| and I did meet with Mr. Kocan, and I had had a number of neighbors sign a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=814)|
| 0:13:46| opposing the variance and suggesting some alternate remedy that perhaps if he would remove the third story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=826)|
| 0:13:56| or the third level of his addition, we would not oppose his variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| But he declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| He did not seem interested in that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| So we are still opposed to the granting of the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| I know there's been a lot of, well, council's dealt with this once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| and I know there have been some discussions in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| I've talked to Mr. Kocan on several occasions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| My understanding is that Mr. Kocan knows he has a couple options on how to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| and one is for us, well, his choice right now is for us to not approve this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| and he can move down some other avenues to remedy the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| So I'm actually going to make a motion to deny the appeal just for clarity's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| There's a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| Mr. Kocan, if you're going to speak, you do need to come to the microphone just so it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| You'll give us your name and address one more time, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| My name is Iwan Kocan, 5616 Wallwood, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| About this situation, it's over enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| It's the time out for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| I tell them last time when I was here, I'm speaking with Mr. Tom Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| He was Friday in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Mr. Bob Baker and Mr. Joe Bailey was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| I said, I have to remove the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| I'm not turning down the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| It's everything I'm putting in the paper what I have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| I'm putting the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| I give the paper here because I understand to say the day that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| I like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=957)|
| 0:16:08| I like to ask because Mr. Bob Baker says turn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| They said that they were going to turn down the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| Closer to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Make it clearly for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| Go ahead, Mr. Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| Mr. Kocan, I've had a couple conversations with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| and you've been presented with two options on how to deal with the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| One is to move your side wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| My understanding is that's the way you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| I move the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| To accomplish that, we're going to turn down the appeal here because your appeal says you don't want to move the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| I move the fourth floor down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| You've chosen not to follow that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| The motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| 10B is an appeal by Phyllis Severance of the Board of Zoning Appeals' decision to approve the request for variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| to reduce the Martha Berry Drive front yard setback from 40 feet to 28 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| reduce the Ridgecrest Drive front yard setback from 40 feet to 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| and reduce the east side yard setback from 12.5 feet to 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| As per site plan to construct a residence on the recorded lot in an R1EN established neighborhood district property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| located at 1900 Martha Berry Drive, that's in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| and that is in conjunction with 11S, which is a resolution approving the appeal by Phyllis Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1059)|
| 0:17:48| There is right now no one signed up to speak on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| I believe, both of them, I believe the property owner knew it was tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| I received a letter from Mrs. Severance Thursday of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1082)|
| 0:18:11| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| Okay, Mrs. Severance is here and says she does not wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| May I ask you a question anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| I'm sorry, you'll have to come down once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| You'll have to, even not to speak and ask questions, you'll have to give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| Sorry, I didn't see you sitting back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| My name is Phyllis Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| I live at 1911 Martha Berry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Did you all have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Mason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| We have spoken with him by telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| We did not feel like it was necessary to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| We think that the lady that lives next door is going to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1129)|
| 0:18:59| She has had her loan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| She's waiting on appraisal and that seems to suffice with Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| And Mr. Mason knew we're here tonight, but he did not want to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Based on that, I'll make a motion to approve Mrs. Severance's appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| A motion and a second are to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't hear Mrs. Severance clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| So would you restate for me what she said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| I think I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| The gist was it sounds like the lady that's the adjoining property owner that was here previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| and spoke previously on this is going to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| So it sounds like everything is going to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| And based on that and the prior discussions that we've had, I made the motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| Well, that's what I thought I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| But that isn't a definite, or it is, a definite purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| No, the loan's been approved, but, you know, I guess until closing and names are signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| I guess it's nothing ironclad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Mrs. Severance, do you want to maybe clear that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Thank you, Phyllis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| She's waiting on the appraisal to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| The loan has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| She's waiting for the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| And so you're confident that that is going to, that sale is going to go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Yeah, this is sort of a process question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| And I apologize because I missed the discussion where council talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| and this might well have gotten dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| And I didn't get to ask Mr. Donaldson this before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| But this is a variance in a zone that has specific design criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| And it feels a little out of culture to be doing this before the design work's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| And I'm wondering, Mr. Donaldson, is this how the system should work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| I mean, it almost feels like in some, in the infill house, in the R1IH, this is all done sort of as a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1266)|
| 0:21:15| And is there a better way to get the process done on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| Does that question even make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Because if it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| There is no proper order of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Should the neighbor buy the property, there's nothing that says that she's going to build anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| No, but, I mean, the variance we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| I'm not talking about the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| I'm talking about the fact that we got a variance for somebody to build a house that hadn't been approved by any of the design guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Well, yeah, the variance is to setbacks, which determine the building envelope upon which a house would have to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| and designed according to that building envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| So it makes sense if you're going to build something to know what your outer boundaries would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| So this doesn't seem, it seems strange to me, but you're the expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| So I'm comfortable now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Councilman Becker, tonight is the first time we have heard that there was a buyer who was not planning to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1334)|
| 0:22:25| Because prior, there was at least the possibility and the probability that someone would buy it and develop something on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1345)|
| 0:22:35| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| So it kind of does change the shape of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| No, I think this is a perfect thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| My question would have applied before the buyer came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1376)|

| 0:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Without making a motion, I see Mr. Hunt and Ms. Hummel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Just a couple of general questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| My question, I don't know if others on council had this question and maybe it can get resolved tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| There has been some fund balance spending on this, but every budget that we've had before, you all are following the same guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1443)|
| 0:24:18| and you're using the same criteria and going through the same steps to develop your budget, whether it was you or your predecessor was Joe Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1458)|
| 0:24:29| Patrick and Michelle, if you'd both just give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| Patrick Hunt, 1111 Luttrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Michelle Hummel, 402 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Yeah, Mr. Frost, that's essentially accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| Steve Wise was my immediate predecessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| I was on the board at the time that this current budget, I apologize, was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| And we went through the normal process of developing the budget over about a three-month period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| having one board meeting at which the budget was discussed, and then having a second board meeting at which the budget was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1501)|
| 0:25:12| And so the normal process was followed to develop the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| I seem to remember there's been one other time since I've been on council I think that you all did some fund balance spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| This isn't wholly out of the ordinary for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| That's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| In the past, if we did not spend the entire assessment collection from a particular fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| we carried that forward in a fund balance and then potentially used those funds in that next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| And there was actually several years where the fund balance accumulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| and it gave us the flexibility we needed to participate in financing of the Mass General Store deal to come to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1551)|
| 0:26:00| In addition to, our budget is approved at the end of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| and the assessments for CBID, the property taxes, are not certified until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| So we take a conservative number for the estimate on the assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| knowing that we can amend the budget later throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Okay, so you all will wait on good projects to come along and save up for that and then spend as those projects develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1577)|
| 0:26:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| In fact, this year in a recent strategic planning retreat that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| one of our four strategic priorities was to create a process and a funding mechanism for what we would refer to as catalyst projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1592)|
| 0:26:43| That's a way for us to basically not allocate all of our funding in a line item specific fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| that gives us the flexibility to then act on catalyst projects if they meet certain criteria that are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| We plan to establish that criteria through an annual stakeholder survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| where we survey property owners that contribute the assessments that fund our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| as well as non-stakeholder groups, consumers who visit downtown, work downtown, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| through a review of our recruitment efforts for businesses in the prior year and other criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| to then proactively establish what should those catalyst projects be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| And we want to make sure that we have the financial resources to fund those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Okay. Now, I don't pretend to know everyone on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Is the city represented by either Mr. Martin or Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| Actually, we have a new one. It's Hannah Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| We've had in the past Madeline Wild and most recently Ann Wallace and now Hannah Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| Other questions on this? Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| If there are any other questions, I'll go back to my motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Okay. The motion and second is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Additional discussion? Mrs. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| I understand, I think, your rationale for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| because you'd like to spend some time discussing pertinent details with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| But how are we going to agree that you'll be in touch with council to set up those appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| or what do you envision as the way in which you will reach all of us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Yes. I sent an e-mail this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Many of you may have gotten it. Others may not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| And I apologize that it came so late before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| indicating that I would be contacting you to set up individual meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| In fact, Michelle and I already have a meeting scheduled with Councilwoman Roddy next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| So we will take the initiative to make those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| Additional? Okay. The motion is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1729)|

| 0:31:41| Well, it's noteworthy that this is a follow-up to an item that this council spent a lot of time discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| and debating, the Kroger across from Gibbs Drive on Broadway and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| I think it shouldn't just pass by without making some note of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| This is actually the working out of a lot of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Good point. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Neighbors are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Yeah, I'd just comment that I had a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| The grocery store this week with some folks that were quite out of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| They were Gibbs Drive people down west, and they were saying how excited everyone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| and how pleased with the way they got worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1935)|

| 0:32:22| and everyone for working with those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=1942)|

| 0:33:49| Councilman Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| I wanted to ask someone from Community Development to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| Eight foreclosures in a HOPE VI project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Is that high? Is that low?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| And whether it's high or low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| didn't we have a program in place to help people to enter into homeownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| Yeah, this is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| I don't really know whether that's a high number or a low number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| I do know that the economy has caused a lot of foreclosures everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| And the HOPE VI site is no different from a lot of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| The program that was in place to assist families primarily assisted them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2068)|
| 0:34:36| to get into homeownership through training classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| and the down payment assistance, the subsidies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| But all the homeowners got mortgages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| whether they were through a bank or a mortgage company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And, of course, they were required to make those payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| Are there any lessons learned that you could share in terms of why we have this level of foreclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| outside of just the economy being bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| The only thing I can comment on that I'm aware of is the fact that when the houses were sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2108)|
| 0:35:17| it was easy for lower income families to get a mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2117)|

| 0:35:27| You really just had to have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| If your credit was bad, you could still get a mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| And some families got adjustable rate mortgages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| And they anticipated financing those at a fixed rate in a year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| after they'd made their payments for a year and established a good credit history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| And at that time, that's when the economy sort of bottomed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| and they weren't able to refinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Do you feel like we gave people a good product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| In other words, did they get in over their head because the maintenance costs on the houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| No, I don't think that's the issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2167)|

| 0:38:20| Councilman Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| I did want to ask if Officer Husky would come down and explain from an enforcement standpoint what are the changes that you think are worth noting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2302)|
| 0:38:34| Because it's more than just housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| There's quite a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| And as we know, vehicles have changed over the years also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| There's a lot of minivans in use now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Taxi cabs there weren't back in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| And most of our ordinances seem to be from the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| You might just go to the one there where Steve is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I don't think there's feedback there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| We're not sure what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| Most of the ordinances seem to be from the 1960s and needed a little update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| And we've been getting a lot of complaints from owners for such things as they have a high turnover with drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2356)|
| 0:39:25| And currently they have to come in and get fingerprinted and go through a process which can take two or three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| And we do not have a system set up to issue any type of temporary driver permits to allow them to work based on certain checks until we receive the TBI and FBI checks back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2371)|
| 0:39:41| So we put that in their form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Also the age of the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Currently our city ordinance is eight years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| After that they cannot be used as a taxi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Most cities go past eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Nashville is nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| And then they allow them to get a two-year waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| We've proposed to go stay with the eight years and allow a two-year waiver based on an additional mechanical inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| some additional checks on the vehicles to allow them to go to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| Also we want to be consistent throughout our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| There's a lot of sections that currently kind of contradict each other, so we want to be consistent and clarify some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| A lot of it talks about a director of public safety, which has changed some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| We also met with the KTA ground committee and then we went to the full KTA board where our complaints go with tax and limo complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2431)|
| 0:40:40| And they passed it by resolution to send it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Spoke with some of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| There is a lot of changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| I think I provided a summary of the substantive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2456)|

| 0:41:34| Just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| The motion is by Mr. Frost, who is one of those originally voting no, which means he can make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| The reconsideration will mean we can actually consider the substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=2500)|

| 0:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Sit right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you for the chance to speak, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| This is the old AJ Broyles property on the corner of 17th and Ehler that I bought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3019)|
| 0:50:27| a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| And I bought it with the intent to develop it into either a nice climate controlled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| one of these big nice climate controlled storage facilities, which I'm in the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| or potentially a Holiday Inn Express or a nice hotel or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| And over the past year or two with banks and loans and funding the way they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| I've not been able to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| And in the meantime, had a contract on the property to sell it to a group who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| as I understand it, would want to build an office building on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| After they went to contract, they hired Joe Huey to do a title search on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| And one of the title objections that showed up was, I believe in 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| city council passed an ordinance to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| There was an alleyway that ran through the middle of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| and city council passed an ordinance to close that alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| I understand there was some difficulty with the prior property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| and I'm not exactly sure what all happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| but in any event, the ordinance was passed and the alleyway was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| There's a chain link fence around my property right now with which that alleyway runs right through the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| So when this title objection came up, I was made aware of it several weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| and so I went to work on trying to cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| Met with the city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| They pretty much told me that they didn't really feel that they had any future needs to that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3121)|
| 0:52:12| and asked them to give me a letter stating that, which I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| But as I understand it, the way that these ordinances were worded back then is different than they're worded now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| I think the city gave up their rights to ingress and egress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| but not to any future utilities that might be located within that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| There is an AT&T fiber optic telephone line that runs through that easement right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| which I have been in contact with AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| We know it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| They've agreed that if and when we develop the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| that they would agree to have the easement relocated as long as we pay for the relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| They would agree to have the easement redirected so that one building could be built on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| And so the reason that I have requested this is that my buyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| we have a due diligence period that runs out on the 16th of September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| and I'm afraid if I can't get this language corrected, they may walk or they may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| I'm just trying to get my title cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| But I don't want to sit here and promise council that if you all pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| that you all are going to get a brand new office building by these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| because this is just one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| This is just a stepping stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| I've still got the AT&T that we've got to get cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| So that's why I'm asking, and I know it's not standard practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Further questions for Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Well, no, I was about to suggest we ask Mr. Smith to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| I'll hold until later if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| This is, I guess, for both Mr. King and Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| The alley is presently closed, and it was done so in 1980, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| That we are just simply addressing the easement provided for South Central Bell telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3239)|
| 0:54:09| and nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Well, the South Central Bell, it was South Central Bell, now AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| Their successors and interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| I believe, Mr. Swanson, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that AT&T is a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| What we're dealing with with this language to amend the ordinance would be just any rights that the city would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| as far as any future utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| We know that there's no utilities right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| There's no storm drainage, and there's no water or sewer lines there at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| And so I believe what this one sentence does to amend the ordinance would just be to do away with any present utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3288)|
| 0:54:59| that are there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Am I right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| It will deal with both present utilities that are there now and any future utilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| It will do away with the city's right to locate future utilities in that same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3307)|
| 0:55:17| And obviously you're going to have to deal with the currently existing AT&T easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| And if you can't deal with that, then all of this is probably an exercise in futility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| It's a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| But as to the alley, it is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| We're not reopening it or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| I'm going to go to Ms. Pell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Do you want to go next or do you still want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Because if you recall, this was a very contentious discussion a couple of years ago when the property was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| I think Joy of Music requested the closing of that alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| And I believe Mr. Boyles did not want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| And so I thought Mr. Smith might want to comment that he had been in contact with Joy of Music School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| And there's agreement that this would be very satisfactory for both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| And that was another issue that came up in this title opinion Mr. Huey did was that any surrounding property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| would have to release any potential rights that they may have to the easement within my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| And so I believe that the Joy of Music was we actually have drafted a quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| And I think the Joy of Music was glad to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| So that's another one of my stepping stones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| But we've got three issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I've got this one with the city's rights to utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| I've got the AT&T issue and then the Joy of Music issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| And I believe if I can get those issues solved, whether these guys build a building on it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| this will have to be done before that property can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| I'm sure that everyone wants to see it developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| I'm going to go to Councilman Hall next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Well, it brings up the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| I want to comment about similar to what Councilman Pelo was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| Is this the alley that runs behind the Joy of Music that we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| It runs between the Joy of Music building and their parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| If you drive into the Joy of Music School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| actually their drive into their property is right in the center of the property in this parking lot on the Euclid Avenue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| And then on the interstate side is the building right against the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| And so actually this, and if you recall, it ran directly from Red Cross Street all the way over to, what is it, 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3459)|
| 0:57:50| I've got a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| I'll be glad to show you if you want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| I think Councilman Hopeless has got something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| This won't disturb the Joy of Music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Well, guess what I'm wondering is, is this the same alley we were discussing back a year or so ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| And at that time that alley wasn't closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| The other half is not closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| The half at Broyles is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| The half here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| This does not affect Joy of Music's parking or egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| That's all I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| I believe it protects them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Councilman Hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Well, I'm going to go back to my previous remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| I'm sort of torn on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| But at this point, because it's so clear cut, I think I'm going to withdraw my objections and vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090908?start=3520)|
