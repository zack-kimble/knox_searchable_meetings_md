| 0:08:30| And last but not least, I want to take a moment to thank the brave men and women who work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| to protect and serve our community every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| The last few weeks have been particularly challenging and emotional for our entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| There are a lot of people hurting in our community, and that includes those at KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=522)|

| 0:08:52| to keep us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=532)|

| 0:08:57| people they're trying to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=537)|

| 0:09:04| I appreciate their compassionate and professional way that they approach their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=544)|

| 0:09:13| recruit and retain quality, well-trained officers committed to service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| Despite these staffing shortages, our officers are working around the clock to address and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| respond to crimes, especially the violent crimes that cause so much harm in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=561)|

| 0:09:31| and protests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=571)|

| 0:09:36| healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| The relationship between police and the community only works when there is trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Building and maintaining that trust is critical for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| So again, thank you to KPD officers and to community members who are working towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=586)|

| 0:11:22| Islander Heritage Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=682)|

| 0:11:34| So there's kind of a gap in when a lot of Asian Americans or Asians were able to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=700)|

| 0:11:51| When I heard about what was going on with COVID in India, one of my first thoughts was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=711)|
| 0:11:59| does this mean that people who look Indian are going to experience violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| And that should not be anybody's first thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| So I just want to bring some awareness that there are a lot of people of that ancestry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=732)|

| 0:13:34| Seeing no further discussion or questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| all those in favor, please say I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=815)|

| 0:13:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Nine A is an ordinance to rezone property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| located at 4821 North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| from the CG2 district to CG1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Eric Garcia Salas, applicant, 5th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| There's someone's hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| May I have chair for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Okay, the motion's been made to approve and seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| and there is someone who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| Mr. Benjamin Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| There are three people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Two, four, and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| So, Mr. Mullen, please, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| for stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Ben Mullen, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| I'm here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| We've talked about this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| This, I guess, is the third time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| It was postponed the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| This is a rezoning for a small parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| on North Broadway from CG2 to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| And the entire reason the rezoning is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| is because we have an investor wanting to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| and put a business on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| on a piece of property that's been underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| and want to make an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| for a Take 5 service station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| which is a drive-in, drive-out, stay-in-your-car concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| which this would be the second type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| of this type of development in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| And the entire reason the CG1 is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| is because the uses are allowed under each zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| CG2, CG1 both allow the same use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| both allow this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| However, because of the size of this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| because it is small and it is narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| there is, it's not appropriate to develop under CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| because you just can't get a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| that works with the turn radiuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| for the vehicles coming off of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| off of the side alley into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| The property owner is also here and signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| as well, and representative of Pfizer, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| and they can talk more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| But they're going to continue to own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| They own the shopping center behind the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| And this is an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| It's going to be a ground lease for a total of 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| It's a 15-year initial term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| and with renewals, it is up to 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| And there's been emails that have gone around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| to all council members that should show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| what the concept looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| should show what the building looks like and the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| which is already being considered by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Now, I understand the need for walkability in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| and the intent behind the original idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| for this to be CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| This fronts North Broadway very close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| to its intersection with I-640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Vehicles are coming off I-640 and going to their residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| And these types of businesses are intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| to be in that area because it is more vehicular-oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| than it is pedestrian-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| And that is evidenced by the other types of businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| the other types of vehicular-oriented businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Other similar service stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| other drive-through restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| And there's this stretch of North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| has 45,000 daily trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| So this concept is uniquely situated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| for this type of property in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| And I understand there's been a lot of debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| about changing CG1 and CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| This did get the recommendation of Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| after a very, very thorough conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| And we've had very thorough conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| both here and people have reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| and spoken to individual commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| So while I understand Mr. Thomas's objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| I think this is one of these situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| where reasonable minds can differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| And I think we're both reasonable in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| But at this point, when we have a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| that wants to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| and actually make a piece of property useful again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| put the property back on the tax rolls in a meaningful way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| this is what we need to be encouraging in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| So I would respectfully ask that you follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| the recommendation of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| in what they recommended to approve this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and pass this on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| And Mr. Osborne is here at Pfizer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| and I'm sure he can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| from the owner's perspective as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| So thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Mr. Osborne, if you could state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Yeah, my name is John Osborne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| and my address is 132 Sherlock Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| I've got handouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| I don't know if it's appropriate to get them out to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| but it's a visual of the proposed site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| and the visual of the site plan existing in CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| And here's why I would like to hand them out if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| We take one each for me, you can hand out the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| Here's this one too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| We've been part, and by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I appreciate Mr. Thomas's objections as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| We've been part of the district since the mid 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| We do own, the Pfizer family does own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| the Food City Center behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| immediately behind this 4821 parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| We also developed the parcel immediately north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| of the Dunkin' Donuts in Chipotle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Had we owned this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| when recode was coming down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| we probably would have taken the matter up then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| because we've got a few reasons why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| we feel it should be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| but I want to focus on just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| As Mr. Mullins already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| the use for this property is permitted in both CG2 and CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| but the permitted use is not functional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| is not safe when executed in CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| which is why we're seeking the rezone to CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| which as Mr. Mullins said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| MPC recommended and by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| or in which city council initially voted eight to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| to approve on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Second, and as important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| we feel this rezone request does not undermine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| the spirit of the CG2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| So if you could just look at these images,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| start with the existing CG2 image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| It shows the compromised functionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| of this permitted use due to the CG2 dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| the build two zone in specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Upon leaving the stalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| if you build it to 20 feet as CG2 stipulates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| there isn't sufficient turning radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| to exit or enter safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| But even more pressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| given the size of today's SUVs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| if you build it within 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| the second you leave that stall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| you'll be virtually protruding onto North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| and in the way of the 40,000 vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| maybe 45,000 vehicles that access that highway every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Now, if you look at the CG1 exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| that will show you that it remedies both these problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| with a very slight and modest setback modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| And if you compare the two site plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| to me, there's very little difference aesthetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| And that's because the CG1 site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| the proposed site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| it doesn't call for some huge setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| like you might see in the old C3 or in the current CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| like that center I just talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| that's immediately North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| that the Pfizer Incorporated Group developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| That building is set back 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| That's designed to park in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| That is a very big setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| But that's not the case with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| 4821 North Broadway is not parked in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| It is parked in back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| You can see it on the site plan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| There will always be parking in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| This means that future users will be free to convert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| the front to any number of pedestrian friendly uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| There are garage doors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| It could be an indoor outdoor cafe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| with a smattering of tables to provide terrace seating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| it strikes me as very pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| So the long-term vision of walkability is not jeopardized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| The spirit of CG2 zoning is honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| Also, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| I believe this is the exact same user,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| the exact same use in the exact same rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| that city council voted to approve in Bearden recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| The only difference in that case was the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| did not get MPC, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| that that site did not get MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| for the rezone, this site did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| If I could boil down everything I just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| in one little pithy paragraph, it would be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| All we are asking is that you allow a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| that is permitted in both zones to be executed in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| that provides greater functionality and greater safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| yet does so in a manner that still honors the spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| and the intent of the original CG2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Thank you, Mr. Osborne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| One person signed up to speak in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Mr. Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Mr. Givens, you could approach the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1374)|

| 0:23:09| Since we're discussing rezoning for a business owner here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| and since the other gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| have covered a lot of the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| I think it's appropriate to discuss the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| of zoning in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| I'd like to read some selections from an essay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1398)|

| 0:23:27| Mr. Givens, that's not germane to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| This is an agenda item about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| and I'm discussing the history of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| and its implications on modern governance, policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| You'd have to make it specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| to the agenda item before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| which is the specific property and agenda in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1418)|
| 0:23:49| I'm gonna just continue talking, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| because I don't know what your ruling means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Well, the agenda item, I'll read it for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| is to rezone property located at 4821 North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| from CG2 to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| That's correct, and I'm gonna discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| the history of zoning by cities in such locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| and the history of zoning in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| So what's the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Well, try to make it relevant to the agenda item before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| I believe that it is, so I'm gonna go ahead and continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Okay, I'll allow you to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Oh, that's very generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| The introduction of zoning in the early 1900s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| launched a revolution in American land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| regulation, and planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| beginning with the height regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1466)|

| 0:24:59| principally as a way to shape the built environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1499)|

| 0:25:24| looked to zoning as a tool for social reform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| as well as land use control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1526)|

| 0:25:30| not only to exclude incompatible uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| from residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1532)|

| 0:25:44| and excluding undesirables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| The two interest groups that were most often regarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| as undesirables were immigrants and African-Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1548)|

| 0:25:59| as a mechanism for protecting and enhancing property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1559)|

| 0:26:06| Southern cities persisted in seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| a legally defensible way to use zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| to control black residential change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| In the place of race zoning per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| many cities turned to expulsive zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| which permitted the intrusion into black neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| of disruptive, incompatible uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| that have diminished the quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| and undermined the stability of those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| If this change makes this neighborhood less walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| in favor of more oil change facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| to be used by people not from this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| it seems like expulsive zoning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| Now we're talking about the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| This is the same type of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| that has thrown District 6 into a 42% poverty rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| the same type of zoning that led to high crime rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| near Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| This type of expulsive zoning is further enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| by over-policing and harassment of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| while not actually preventing the gun deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| of five children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| This type of systemically racist policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| is what led KPD to allow officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| to kill a child in a bathroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| arrest the cops that killed Anthony Thompson Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| That concludes public forum on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| City Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| you have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Yes, Mayor, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| For Mr. Osborne, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Yes, Mr. Osborne, you've owned, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| a good deal of that property in the area for since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| did I hear you say from the 70s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| The family's been in that area since the mid-70s, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| That parcel is new to us, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Have you ever done a pedestrian plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| or a landscape study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| The bulk of the property is one-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Kind of you go down 8A where that food city is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| and there's only one parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| that's actually on besides this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| That's the one with Dunkin' Donuts and Chipotle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| And before Recode was even coming down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| yes, sir, we did add a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| You added a sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| We did, to the parcel immediately north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Right, so is that the only pedestrian-oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| improvements you've made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Again, it's the only frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| but yes, it's the improvements we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| to the area that was fronted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| I believe it was an old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| I can't quite remember the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| It was a Cancun's restaurant, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| I don't think there were sidewalks in it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| It's been four or five years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| but we did add a sidewalk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Have you ever engaged the city at any point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| to try to do perhaps a master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| or something that would make it more pedestrian-friendly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| No, sir, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Any, oh, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| This is for Mr. Osborne also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| We had a really good conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| and I was saying to you that I couldn't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| cafe tables right there at the edge of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| that that was the most convincing argument that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| I have done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| This has been a really difficult issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| in trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| I have to lean towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| if we don't ever start doing pedestrian-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| how will we ever get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| That's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| The other question, what is right behind the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Is that yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| What's right behind 4821 North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| is the city, or the center anchored by Food City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| which is our retail center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| So can this not be redesigned in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| to use more of your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| We actually already gave some of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| to do just that, and no, it couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| without impeding any more ingress and egress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| but we did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| We did, I don't wanna be misquoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| but I believe it was about a quarter of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| We made it from .3 acres to .5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| In fact, if you go to KGIS and click on it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| it shows the way it was before we had it replanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| by, again, deeding from the other entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| that owns the center behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| I just, I really have general comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| I might have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Okay, I'll step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| You can relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I appreciate the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| and I appreciate the comments from those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| both in for and opposed to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| For me, there are two issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| that have brought me to my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| The first one was the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| of this similar project in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| and then also getting some feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| from some of the work that's happened on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| and folks feeling trepidatious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| about cars pulling out onto Cumberland from garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| and you can't see the cars approaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| and feeling like that's impacting their walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| And so for me, I feel like we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| a little bit more discussion about walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| I find these drawings convincing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| imagining if it were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| if the project moved forward under a CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| it could move forward, but it would send cars out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| onto the street, across the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| with less visibility for pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| to see that car approaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| And that's one concern that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| I do think that we can have a mix in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| and still maintain a commitment long-term to walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| And so that's what really helped me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| reach my decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Council Member Testerman, and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| I really do appreciate my colleagues' concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| and thoughts as we've really talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| I guess the one thing I wanted to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| is that within the code, all of the CG properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| regardless, are designed to promote walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| a walkable environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| So be it CG1, 2, 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And so in this case, and given how narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| this particular parcel is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| and the fact that there have been pretty treacherous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| ins and outs of this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| I feel like that CG1, in this case especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| is that we need to give landowners the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| for the highest and best use of being able to use their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| And so, again, kind of going back to what RICO states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| as you look at all of the commercial zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| it's all designed to really promote walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| And so I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Yeah, I wanna thank the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| for an honest conversation this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| and y'all's input thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| And I agree with Council Member Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| that this represents a departure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| from the development plan that was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| I actually think CG1 is okay in this scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| and I wanna make sure that we're as flexible as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| to anybody that wants to open a small business in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| With that said, I don't think spot rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| for an entire, instead of precedent for an entire corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| is the right way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| I do think this is something that the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| should revisit holistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| both for, specifically for this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| but for others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| And so I don't think I'd be supporting the rezoning today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| but only because I don't wanna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I don't think we should spot rezone entire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| instead of precedent for an entire corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| But I do think long-term that CG1 is a flexible use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| that we can include here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| And I do think that it can be walkable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| So that's how I came to my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| I appreciate your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Yes, the problem here is that the applicant is selling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| trying to sell a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| that's too small for the intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| And it's not zoned properly for the intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| So that's why we're kind of at odds with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| The owner hasn't bought the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| So has he just now done it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| No, no, we've bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Okay, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| And we made the property as big as we possibly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| We did buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| The last information I had was that the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| hadn't sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| We bought it in March of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| we may have closed later than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Excuse me, Mr. Osborne, you need to go to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| if you wish to answer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| That's fine to answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2122)|
| 0:35:22| we just need to be able to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| I'm sorry, we had it under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| I believe, don't quote me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| but sometime early, or late first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| early second quarter of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Well, it still is the fact that the property was sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| is too small for the intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| And the buyer knew that it was too small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| without a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| And then the other point I would like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| is that you've had the property for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| since 1970, and you've never done a pedestrian plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| You've put in maybe one sidewalk or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| And a vote to rezone this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| is basically a vote to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| as business as usual for this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| And we are never going to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| This is, the question is whether we want to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| that that area is okay as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| And it's brutally anti-pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| And that is why the vote to rezone this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| is gonna be maintaining the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| And I think we can do much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| And I think we should have a vision to improve this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| And it's not gonna be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| You haven't done it since 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| And rezoning this is going to just follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| right into the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| And I think as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| if we want to move forward in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| we should at least take some incremental steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| And I'm sorry, I just don't see you being that damaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| by not being able to sell this particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| or put this particular use on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| As far as the city goes, I think it would be much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| if we had a little patience and had someone to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| who would have a use for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| that fit the amount of space there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| and it was zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Everything around that is zoned CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| And CG1 is not pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| It has no standards, no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| And what we're gonna see is a domino effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| where developers are gonna come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| on that section over there and continually ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| to rezone from CG2 to CG1 because it has no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| And if we go down this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| we are not going to improve that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| If people think that it's okay as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| then that's the way you should vote to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| But if you want to start making some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| with some vision, we will vote to not rezone this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| and keep it as the planning staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| And the planning staff rightly said that the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| for rezoning this property has not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| It may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2323)|
| 0:38:43| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| I want to start off with saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| how much I appreciate my colleague's comments on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| We've had this discussion several times now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| I think it's important to review that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| One point that was brought up just now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| was the issue of the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Mr. Roberto, I think your mic might be muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| Pull it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Is it still muted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Pull it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| And maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| How about now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| That's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2360)|
| 0:39:20| Well, I was saying that I really appreciate the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| from my colleague and that I have a lot of respect for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| and his thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| One of the things he mentioned at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| was the standards in CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| That's something that council has taken up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| and started to notice and actually passed a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| to have that looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| Director Brooks, can you tell us how we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| on looking at those standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Obviously, it's a recent addition to our work program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| so we have not begun the process of looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| but it definitely is on our work program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| to look at including design standards in the CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| And I would take this opportunity to agree with my colleague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| that we need to get that taken care of right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| The issues of walkability that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| and I know Bearden came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| the concerns that have been discussed today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| in our previous meetings were the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| that I had about walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I've been an advocate for walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| and I certainly wouldn't want to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| that would impede that progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| But if we think about the most walkable parts of Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| they're all zoned CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| And I think that the walkability in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| should not exist only in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| it should exist all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| And so if those most walkable places are CG1 in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| then it makes sense to do that in this zoning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| CG district is designed to promote mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| in a pedestrian-oriented environment, all of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| We talked about, or we heard about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| how it's brutally anti-pedestrian in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| I would remind everyone, the state controls traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| on this major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| which is oriented for vehicular use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| I think we want to encourage investment and improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| and build in walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| So I went back and looked after our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| and took a look at this exact area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| So from Cedar Lane to Adair, there are 17 parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| all of which have front parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| which would not be allowed in CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| That means that each of these are legal nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| So as they're currently zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| if the owner was to do a 50% improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| of the value of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| they'd have to move the building up, demolish the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| That's not incentivizing investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| That's a way of not having investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| We have a zone that was appropriate in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I think it's appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| We all want to see walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| We all want to see investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| We none of us want to see blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| And I think that making this change is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| I would completely agree with my colleague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| that the standards in CG1 need to be fast-tracked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| as quickly as possible because that is an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| and it needs to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Yeah, I just, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| wanted to point out when we talk about walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| and I know that's why we did recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| and put a lot of effort into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| I just feel like we can't achieve that strictly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| with the zoning that we put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| My concern, and I've said this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| when we've discussed this agenda item before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| is that the zoning that we're talking about with CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| reflects kind of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| that you see along Cumberland, downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| some little small pockets in Bearden, Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Those are small pocketed areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| And when you look at the map, you see all of Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| which is a smaller route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| It's not quite the same as Broadway or Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| Anyway, the length of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| all the way from Broadway and Central up to Hotel Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| is zoned CG2, and pretty much nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| that is built there now would meet the CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| The CG2 was put in place to foster walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| but walkability includes factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| like including more mixed use with residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| which we don't require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| And I think that's one of the things we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| There's no percent proportion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| We had a rezoning where someone asked for CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| to be able to do mixed use, but there's no requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Once we give that rezoning, they can do all commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| They could do all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Same thing with CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| And so I feel like there's some pieces we need to tweak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| to try and get what we were going at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| But walkability, when you look at factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| that go into walkability, they talk about pace of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| And if you look at places like Happy Holler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| or Downtown or Hotel Road there in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| those are stretches of road that have slower-paced traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| and create a conducive area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| where you have two-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Some of those buildings built in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| used to be the residences above, historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| and the commercial down below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| So I'm meandering around, but the point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| is that there's a difference in those pockets where there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| And I believe there are pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| where that's appropriate on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| I'm just not sold on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| that it's every place along Broadway all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| And I just don't know how we can foster development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| and investment when we've rezoned everything CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| along Magnolia, Cumberland, Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| and huge parts of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| When we see people do reinvestment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| we're going to be at odds with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| So I think we need to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| if walkability is what we're going for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| then we need to put that in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| in terms of making them do part residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| because that's what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| That's how you get your walkable districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| with your cafe shop down below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| You have your residences that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| You increase the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| That's what we were going for, but we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| We're just zoning for commercial, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| And there's no requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Some people are squinting at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| So I feel bad that we're at odds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| I just don't feel that that entire stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| and swath of roadway is to be zoned exactly the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| and that all of those existing uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| can't happen again and should go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| And so that's why I'll be supporting the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| OK, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Yes, I am an admirer of Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| They've really done a tremendous amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| over many, many years to try to make it more walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| But there's different dynamics there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| and CG1 zoning is not the only dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| In Bearden, you had many years of an active neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| association that partnered with businesses and developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| And that, and I used to help build Greenway out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| back in the 90s and after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| So I'm an admirer of Bearden, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| don't think we can use that as a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| here and say that allowing a CG1 here where there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2819)|
| 0:47:07| for an oil change place, where there's no standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| is going to create anything similar to Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| And in all due respect to the owner of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| we don't have that kind of partnership in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| that we had in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| And unless we start enforcing some standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| this area is going to remain much less than its potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| Let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| And I'm not asking for drastic change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| I'm asking for incremental change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| will slowly improve the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| If we don't start now, this is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| to be just the same standard of walkability, of livability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| and access as we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| And so I am strongly against rezoning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| I really think it's not the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I think the planning staff had it exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| I don't think the criteria have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| met as far as there being a change that justifies it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| And the surrounding area is CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| So I think that you all are good listeners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| And you've heard my points made over two other sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| And I don't think that I need to cover other points that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| already made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| And if this was just one meeting, I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| But I appreciate your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| And I know that you've heard what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| And I would hope that my colleagues will vote with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| to deny this rezoning and start the process of making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| this area a better and more livable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| I just want to say that I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| my colleagues in the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| and the speakers that came up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| One of the things that I always want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| to take into consideration is the council member who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| represents a district, because that person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| closer to the district and the voices of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| that they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| And so while we look at zoning and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| it's not necessarily an easy conversation to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| When we talk about walkability, the drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| when we look at the proposed CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| does appear to provide additional space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| But when we're talking about safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| when we're talking about the desires of a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| and what their vision is for the future of that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| I do take the council person, the district representatives'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| recommendations into strong consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| and also feedback and comments that I have received as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| And so because of that, I will be in opposition of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| So the motion on the floor would be to approve the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| and the motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| All those opposed, please say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| I think we need to do a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Councilman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3038)|

| 0:51:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| The motion carries 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3070)|

| 0:53:09| Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Mr. Givens, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3190)|
| 0:53:21| You'll have up to five minutes to address council on the resolution in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| My name is Tyler Givens, 1823 Explorer Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| I had a lot of questions when looking at this particular item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| There didn't seem to be enough information in the printouts that were provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| So I'm going to ask some questions, not really expecting an answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| but I'm just going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| I'm curious what the city is paying per square foot for the easement that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| being purchased here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| It looks like we've got half a million dollars paying for a few feet of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| so that the lots in question get a better sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| And it was a little confusing to me how this location was chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| and how the land was appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Track two, for instance, sold for about $78,000 in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| assuming it got a twelfth of the half million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| It's getting $46,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| It seemed like it was confusing how those numbers made sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| for the appraisal and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| And that wasn't really included in the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| So I checked out the Google Street View to try to figure out better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| why this spot was chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Doesn't seem to be anything outstanding about the homes or their owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| And the sidewalk is about to be built across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| from an abandoned parking lot from an empty church, it looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| But then I saw that the new owner of the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| bought it for about $850,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| and is building a luxury live-work-play condo complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| So then it made sense that the city was going to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| a half million dollar gift to Baker Creek Bottoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| so they could build their overpriced condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| and staff the theater and coffee shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| with low-wage workers who can't afford to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Half a million dollars that could have been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| helping people and businesses that are already here survive the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| It could have improved the economic conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| imposed on black neighborhoods by urban renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| or systemically racist policing or systemically racist zoning policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| It could have been used to help any of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| But instead, it's another gift to a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| who's going to make his profit and socialize any losses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| and continue the cycles of poverty that inevitably lead to violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| and the fear of violence that will be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| to justify shooting children in bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| instead of solving the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Arrest the cops that killed Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| That concludes public forum on this item, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| I just want to say that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Anthony Thompson Jr., the father, the father, sister, brother, say his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| Please refrain from speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3342)|

| 0:56:06| You say that the shooting was justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| The killing was justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| You say there's justice, but there is no justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| OK, council members, I'd like to call a recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| We're asking you to please remove...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| If you cannot...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| I'm calling a 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| We'll reconvene in 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| No justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| OK, council, I'm calling this meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| It's been 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| We're back on item 11D, and I just want to say that this sidewalk connection is a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| important investment that will support neighbors and businesses in South Haven and South Woodlawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| which are both low- to moderate-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| It's going to promote walkability between Baker Creek Preserve and the intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Lancaster and Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| It's a great area of our community, and I hope that you all will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| I'm encouraged about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| Are there any further questions or discussion on this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| I would like a few of the speakers' questions answered if possible, particularly our schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3430)|
| 0:57:21| of projects for the use of the citywide sidewalk funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| Do we have anyone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Mr. Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| The question is about our sidewalk plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| Yes, Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Go ahead, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Council Member Parker, we have a sidewalk plan in draft form right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Frankly, we've been waiting for the opportunity to meet in person so that we could lay maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| out for you all to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| There's a support document with that, along with estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| We have taken, I'll say, a preliminary look at the priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| Obviously, the priorities are based upon what budget monies are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| Before we go forward with that formal plan, we do want Council's input in your specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| districts and also citywide, because you may know things, candidly, that we don't as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| as where areas need sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| Under this particular one, this was a part of, I will call it an unofficial sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| It is one that had been communicated with Council, as well as other departments in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| That's why it was included as part of the sidewalk plan under the 2020-2021 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| I hope I'm answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| If I'm not, please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| I spoke with engineering last year about a sidewalk project that the city began but has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3536)|
| 0:59:05| not completed, and continuation of that has been delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| I was told by engineering that that was on the list of priorities as soon as funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Now, I'm unsure if there's a list that it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| If we can have a better understanding of the order of priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| Councilmember Parker, David Brace said he could answer some of these questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Yeah, great question, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| I think, Councilwoman Parker, sidewalks are one of the number one things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| I know that Councilmembers receive requests for new sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| The resources for new sidewalk construction are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| They're very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| And so, the previous administration had initiated a comprehensive sidewalk analysis and plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| that's in draft form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| We need to roll that out to Council and get feedback from Council on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| This is actually a project that this administration, the Kincannon administration, inherited from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| the Rojero administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| It was important to tie in on that road the existing park facilities and then the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| park facilities at the Gateway Park along Lancaster to a commercial corridor there near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| Sonotaco, the Roundup, the Kenjo, and a bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| And so, these projects take some time to do the design work and actually start the appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| work and the property acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| And so, this is a project that is being completed from the previous administration and prioritized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| during that administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| The long-term sidewalk plan, we do need to roll out to Council and to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| It's in draft form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| I will say that it will require significant new resources to try to actually execute on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| But I am anticipating we'll work with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| Mayor Kincannon had suggested discussing with Vice Mayor McKenzie a sidewalk, greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| and bike ped workshop because all of those are connected so we can come in and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| all of those plans comprehensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| We now will have a plan, a comprehensive plan for each of those types of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| And so, we'll work with Vice Mayor McKenzie and try to get that on your workshop schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Mayor, with your permission, may I expand on that just briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Councilwoman Parker, I apologize and regret the information that you did receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| That plan has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| We're referencing it as a draft only because we want Council's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| But it is actually in two volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| One is what I would call an executive summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| The other is a detailed listing of how we rank the priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| And we want to go over that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| You know your constituents best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| We think we've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| But for us to call that final without your input would be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| I believe we announced it earlier this year that we didn't want this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| Finally, we're going to be able to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| And so, I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| And I do apologize for the misinformation you got that it was not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| The only portion of that that is not complete, which I guess is technically true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| is that we definitely want Council's input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3739)|
| 1:02:30| I'm concerned that we're moving forward with extending from the new sidewalk fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| without a plan in place for how to spend those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| And I would prefer to see that plan in place so that we can ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| that the money that we are spending this year and in future years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| is done so in an equitable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| And I'm concerned that's not the case currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| I would prefer that we have a plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| and so I'm not able to support extending from this fund at the current time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| I want to thank Director Cannon and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| They've reached out to every neighbor on Lancaster, every business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| In a packet, we have noted back in 2019 that this Land Acquisition Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| voted to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| And there's not as busy intersections as the one that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| There's a lot of foot traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| And the neighbors have been waiting this for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| And I know the South Haven neighborhood will be extremely excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| It's a very walkable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| It just needs a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| And we just spent a good bit of time talking about walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| And I think this is really important for that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| And I'm really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3849)|

| 1:04:13| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| 11E is the resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| on behalf of the City of Knoxville necessary to acquire easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| by negotiated purchase within CSX Transportation Railroad property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| for $23,000 as part of the Amherst Road Slope Stabilization Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3873)|

| 1:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| I would just like to ask Mr. Cannon again about that road really needs this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| It's falling apart and getting pretty dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| But why was this acquisition necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| And how is that moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| In order for us to properly stabilize the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| I believe, at least I hope we had in the packet last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| we talked about a gabion retaining wall that would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| constructed on railroad right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| That is part of why this easement is having to be acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| Both a permanent easement, and I believe there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| a temporary construction easement associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Without the retaining wall, we really cannot stabilize the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| And I know that road is being used more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=3928)|

| 1:06:55| should not be allowed a foothold in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| The claim that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| The claim that charter schools provide greater options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| for families is often countered by the accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| of exclusionary enrollment push-out practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| that are viewed as common to many charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| Many participants in the 2017 NCAAP Task Force report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| on charter schools testified about students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| with special needs, those perceived as poor test-takers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| or those who pose as a behavioral challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| are either not accepted or once enrolled are disciplined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| or counseled out by many charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Hilary Shelton, the director of the NAACP Washington Bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| noted that it is our unfortunate experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| that in some cases charter schools are being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| to perpetuate discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| While public schools are required to take every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| it is the option of charter schools to admit Johnny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| but not Jamal or Jose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Witnesses explained that while a charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| may claim to be open to all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| between reserving seats prior to any lottery process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| selective enrollment, the use of exclusionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| discipline processes, or counseling out of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| they may actually be exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Most studies have found that charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| are more racially and economically segregated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| than public schools generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| including underserving English learners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| and special education students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| relative to the public schools in their districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| A study conducted by the UCLA Civil Rights Project in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| found that black males are over three times more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| to get suspended or expelled from charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| than their white peers and that nearly 50% of black students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| attending a charter school were enrolled in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| where the suspension rate for black students was about 25% annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| One of the central tenets of charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| is that they are closed if they do not deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| on the educational commitments outlined in their charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Since the 2016-17 school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| approximately 211 charter schools have closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Since 2001, at least 2,500 charter schools have closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| affecting nearly 300,000 American children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| enrolled in primary and secondary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| School closures disproportionately affect black students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| In 2013, one analysis in Chicago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| found that black students composed 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| of the student enrollment in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| but accounted for 88% of the students affected by closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Similarly, in Philadelphia, black students composed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| 58% of the district's enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| but made up 81% of students affected by closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| During the Memphis hearing, the director of the National Education Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| described how school closures especially hurt black students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Black students are particularly susceptible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| to being impacted by school closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| While the majority of black students are 29% of all students enrolled in charter schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| yet 45% of all students in charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| that closed during those years were black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| While school closures are sometimes seen as evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| that charter schools are in fact more accountable than public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| charter school closures can seriously disrupt students' learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| especially when closures occur during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| The director further described the effects of school closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| on family and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Charter schools offer more stable schooling options for communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| than traditional or magnet schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| 40% of all charter schools opened in 2000 were no longer operating by 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| School closures are touted by charters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| as evidence of high accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| but beyond the disruption they create for students, families, and communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| a study of three cities found that students in closed charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| typically do not move on to higher performing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Charter schools are just one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| market-based solution to a non-market problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| Education is a public good, and for the good of society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| it should be high quality for all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| regardless of their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| We should not be donating land to private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| We should be reimagining the tax system that funds public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| to get more money into schools like Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| so that those students will have good hopes for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| so that this violence will stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| and so that more and more frightened children in bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| fund public education, defund the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| and arrest the cops that killed Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Councilmembers, that concludes the people who signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| The other person who signed up to speak to this withdrew his request to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| There were originally two people signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| and the second person no longer wishes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Is anybody here from Emerald Youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| David Wells, I believe, is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| There's Mr. Wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| And I believe Chip Berry has sent you an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| and I can obviously provide details as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| Mr. Wells, if you could approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| I think a councilmember may have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| Ms. Singh, you have a question for Mr. Wells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| Yes, David Wells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| Address 1026 Clover Death Circle, Friendsville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| My question has to do with the parking lot space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| Is that something that's used by the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| on the weekends or the nights when school is not in session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| To my knowledge, that parking lot is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| to anyone who chooses to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| It is adjacent to the school, so it is very convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| I think it has about 15 spaces in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| so there's no restriction for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| And that will remain no restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| I see no reason for that to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| I believe there was an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| that came before City Council before I joined City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| involving the transfer of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| from the city to Emerald Youth Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| And there was a lot of concern in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| about that transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| And in the end, I believe it was a purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| ultimately, rather than a transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| And in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| I also do not feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| with a transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| I feel like we need to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| public property for the public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| And I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| many of the points made by the public speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| honestly, my experience has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| that charters are a threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| to our public school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| and is what needs our public investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| And so anything outside of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| I am opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| This measure, in my opinion, would be outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| If they would like to purchase the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| that is another situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| But I do not believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| since we acquired the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| we acquired it for the public good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| that the transfer does not meet those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| Thank you, Ms. Parker. Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Just for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| the charter school is under the auspices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| of the Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| so it is a public school. You get into it differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| but it is not a private school. It is a Knox County public school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| Just one question about the transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| My understanding was that this should have happened sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| about the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| Ms. Juneau, I believe you sent us something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| Mr. Brace, can somebody speak to the history of how this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| Mr. Brace? Or is Chip Berry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Either one of you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| Very quickly. Good question, Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| In 1995, the property was transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| to the Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| including a small utility infrastructure piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| for the school that actually crosses over the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| That parking lot has been used by the Boys and Girls Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| during their use of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| The Boys and Girls Club, and it really should have been transferred then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| It was for their use the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| It was then transferred to and sold to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| Emerald Charter School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| which is separate from Emerald Youth Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| It really is a cleanup right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| The city is responsible for maintenance and liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| Emerald will take over that maintenance and liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| and, as Mr. Wells stated, is open to public use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| in the evening and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| Those are all public uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| It actually is used by the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| whoever has owned the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| but the city never actually transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| this particular lot that went with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| We're just wanting to transfer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| to release ourselves from liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| and let Emerald Charter School have the liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| but it is still available for public use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| is what I heard. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| Thank you, Ms. Fuca. Thank you, Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Any opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| Motion carries 8-1. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| 11H is a resolution authorizing the submission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| of the 2021-2022 Annual Action Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| to the Five-Year Consolidated Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| for Housing and Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| and authorizing the Mayor to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| any required documents under the Community Development Block Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| Home Investment Partnerships Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| and Emergency Solutions Grants Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| Mr. Givens has signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4628)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you very much. Tyler Givens, 1823 Explorer Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Again, my discussion is wide-ranging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| but I believe it directly relates to this HUD grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| as this HUD grant is integral to undoing years of damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| by Knoxville government policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| including exclusionary zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| Back in the day, Louisville, Kentucky had a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| that prohibited a white man from selling his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| to a black one if that neighborhood was already majority white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| This HUD grant is part of fixing that kind of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled in Buchanan v. Worley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| that what Louisville was doing was unconstitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| but that the city might have a legitimate interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| in promoting public health, safety, welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| but that did not justify the direct violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| In what would become an enduring American tradition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| white homeowners found other ways to keep their neighborhoods segregated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| such as the neighborhoods are segregated in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| which this HUD grant helps to make a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| As Buchanan was being argued in the nation's capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| there were only eight American cities with zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| 20 years later, there were 1,246, according to economist William Fishel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| While previous attempts at zoning had to do with safety concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| like fires or light and air regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| the new feature rights that zonings from 1910 onwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| represented an important break with the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| The new features were the comprehensiveness of its map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| and of the law's presumption that single-family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| were to get the most protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Comprehensive federal protections for housing discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| wouldn't come about until 1968,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Congress passed the Fair Housing Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| which would not only discriminate due to race, color, national origin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| religion, sex, familial status, and disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| but the government also had the obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| to affirmatively further fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| Despite this mandate, zoning laws proliferated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| that have entrenched a de facto discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| Instead of explicitly barring people due to their race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| these laws have taken the form of regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| like minimum sizes for new homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| that make the cost of development so exorbitant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| so that the only profitable types of homes to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| are large or luxury units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| which we can see happening all over Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| Exclusionary zoning laws essentially trap many black families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| into low-income neighborhoods by pricing them out of the richer ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| Ending residential segregation using these grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| would allow Americans to move from poor neighborhoods or cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| to richer ones and allow low-skilled workers to find better-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| To put a number on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| exclusionary zoning has artificially inflated the price of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| so much that one paper estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| that from 1964 to 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| it lowered aggregate growth by more than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| These HUD funds are a tiny step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| in the right direction for justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Obviously, these racist zoning codes have had a major impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| on the distribution of property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| as well as the impact on the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| of majority black public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| while giving land away to charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| Perhaps if education and poverty were directly addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| we would not need police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| who break multiple policies and shoot scared students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| in the bathrooms at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| arrest the cops that killed Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Do we have any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| Seeing none, all those in favor please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I'm sorry, Ms. Parker, I didn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| Or a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| Just a comment because I don't feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| I have the power to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Just a comment to put it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| I feel that this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| and our funding thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| has focused too much on neighborhood stabilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| and not on the housing needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| of the very low income in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| And that's what my main concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I did bring this up at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| you know, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| significant portion of some of our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| going towards owner-occupied rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| and smaller number of our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| going in other areas of great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| And as I've said before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| there are many areas of great need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| but to ensure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| are creating an equitable budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| we have to prioritize those with the most need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| And I'm not seeing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| without shelter prioritized in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| those lacking income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| those that are in that very low income bracket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| I know that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| additional funding, federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| that we'll be discussing soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| I hope that's one area where we can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| those portions of our population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| prioritized because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| there are commitments proposed in the budget to celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| but some of them I think, man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| this is similar to what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| during the empowerment zone money time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| when we had new federal dollars coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| but we have such an exponential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| amount more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| coming in now than we did 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| and so we should be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| go above and beyond 1.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| We should be able to go above and beyond what we're committing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| transitional housing and these other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| where we truly need affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| more immediately than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| And so I just want to keep pushing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| that's where our focus needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| during a pandemic as we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| ending hopefully a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| rather than as the discussion was during the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| you know strategies for increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| the home value of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| through the use of these dollars. I do not think that's the urgent need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| in our community at the moment. I think getting folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| actually into housing is the urgent need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| at the moment. Thank you that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Thank you Ms. Parker. Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| Seeing none. All those in favor please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| Aye. Any opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5038)|

| 1:24:06| 11-I is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| to execute a subgrantee agreement with Knoxville Area Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| to provide an amount not to exceed $90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| in HUD CDBG-CV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5055)|

| 1:24:27| and seconded. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| Okay we have someone signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| to this agenda item. Mr. Gibbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5076)|
| 1:24:49| Tyler Gibbons 1823 Explorer Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| and I speak to support the motion but agree with Ms. Parker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| assessment that we could do a better job of apportioning the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| I'd like to further discuss how these grants can help undo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| damage done by the city of Knoxville in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5101)|

| 1:25:13| keynote speaker of a United Way virtual event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| and explained how racial neighborhood disparities are a systemic problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| To understand what we are seeing in Knoxville today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| the separation of neighborhoods, I think it is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| for us to start all the way back to post-Civil War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| Knoxville, Elliman said. The answers aren't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| sitting there for us to grab them. We have to sit and talk about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| together to get results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| In the post-Civil War era, Knoxville wanted to get back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| a sense of normalcy and an industrial boom hit the scruffy city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| in a big way. During this time, black people made up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| about 30% of the population. Employees and employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| often lived in the same area and neighborhoods like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Mechanicsville were mixed and integrated. When the Great Depression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| hit and industry started to fade away, the Roosevelt New Deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| entered the nation. A federal effort to provide housing to low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| families started but caused segregation to expand in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| Knoxville. Government housing was built in separate neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| to cater to black and white populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| and areas like Mechanicsville were no longer integrated because of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| Knoxville has burned in boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| where people of varying social status and color live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| It's called a red line map and it was created in the New Deal era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| Banks giving out loans in that era declared neighborhoods like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| East Knoxville, quote, red. That's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| low-income whites, immigrants, and black people live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| The red designation signified to banks in that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| those people might default on their loans, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| in reality their rates were not higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| For people who were in the red zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| it made it impossible for them to rebuy or refinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Elliman said. But in areas like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| West Knoxville, closer to the water with rolling hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| where the population of homeowners is majority white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| that area was declared green and safe to loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Those neighborhood disparities and housing trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| still exist today, but that doesn't mean the inequities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| have to be there in the future. These grants can be a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| step towards justice, if applied appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| but further steps are needed, like arresting the cops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| that killed Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| Okay, council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| there's no further people signed up to speak to this. Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5240)|

| 1:28:23| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| Thank you, members. As I mentioned earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| I'm really excited about this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| It invests in our community's recovery. It invests in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| It invests in innovative new programs that can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| address big challenges while also addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| root causes. Council will be holding budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| next week on May 13th and 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| and I and my team will look forward to sharing more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| and responding to council's questions about specific programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| I'd like to also mention quickly for those who may be wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| the budget does not include any federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| from the American Rescue Plan Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| We are still waiting for final guidance about what those funds can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| and cannot be used for. As we learn more, we will share more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| information about that to council and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| amendments as necessary to the adopted budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| Any further questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| or comments about this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| We have some people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| Okay. First person who signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| in opposition is Moira Connelly. Ms. Connelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| could you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5372)|
| 1:29:42| Hey, everybody. My name is Moira Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| My street address is 5726 Briscoe Circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| The mayor says that this budget reflects her values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| If that's the case, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| fair to ask if the mayor really values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| community-based violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| And I have three things to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| And I understand the limits that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| council members have in this mayor's strong government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| So I would really encourage these issues to be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| to council members and members of the public as the hearings roll out next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| So the first one is, why is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| more money being put forth for new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| violence interruption measures in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| We're not talking about refunding programs that already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| We're talking about a new commitment of 4 to 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| million dollars, something approaching 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| of the KPD budget that would indicate a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| investment in our communities, especially to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| those programs flourish that already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| We have people who have lived experience, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| already act as mentors, who help with career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| development, who help with tutoring, who help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| with after-school programs and access to art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| activities and enjoyment in outdoor activities like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| fishing. These people have lived experience. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| in our community. We don't need Cities United to tell us they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| We know they're here. Let's get those people some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| to do their programs. Let's get a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| program from the City funded with 4 to 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| million dollars to roll out community-based grants to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| who are already in our community. Let's offer them technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| assistance to apply competitively for City grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| So that's one thing. So we need new money for violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Second, Crimestoppers is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| violence interruption. Crimestoppers is law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| So to my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| Crimestoppers, funding that is a way of rising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| the KPD budget outside of the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| line item. That's disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| It's essentially giving KPD more money. It's a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| bribe community members, to attempt to bribe community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| because our community members are so smart, they're not going to take the bribe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| So it's an attempt to bribe community members to engage with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| law enforcement, and that erodes trust in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| So if Crimestoppers is absolutely going to be funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| it needs to be funded on KPD's line item with no new money added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| out of the current KPD budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| The real reason I'm here is because we have a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| that's rolling out across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| that Knoxville should embrace, which is an alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| team that pairs a medic and a behavioral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| health specialist to respond to non-violent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| health crises in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| We need to, many, many people across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| across the political spectrum, can agree on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| that we need to be reducing the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| times that members of the community have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| encounter and engage with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| So KPD has a co-responder model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| that is currently budgeted, I believe, for about $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| This new budget not doubles down, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| quadruples down on the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| co-responder model. This is literally throwing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| good money after bad. The $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| that this budget has for the co-responder model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| should be moved to a new program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| that would be an alternative response model that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| Denver is doing, that Eugene, Oregon is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| that Austin, Texas is doing, that Los Angeles is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| that New York is doing. This is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| engagement and reimagining community safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| is headed in our country, and Knoxville is going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| We need a community response model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| that has community oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| but community health professionals engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| in things like suicidal ideation calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| wellness check, houseless issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| addiction care, mental health that does not need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| engage law enforcement. So my three takeaways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| We need brand new money for community-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| violence interruption so that our people who are already doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| this work can get paid for it instead of doing it by volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| Second of all, Crime Stoppers is not violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Third of all, you need to get on board with a community coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| called HEART, Healing East Tennessee Alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5642)|

| 1:39:13| A black family of a child murdered by KPD comes in. Black folks speak loudly to advocate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5953)|
| 1:39:20| justice, immediate arrest, and disrespect to the family. Almost as disrespectful as this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5960)|
| 1:39:30| y'all put in front of us. This budget fails our communities and fails to address the root causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| that could have saved the lives of young people like Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| It guarantees tragedies like Ant's death and all the deaths of the young folks who died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| unfortunately. It guarantees that those will continue. Now, all of my friends in red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=5985)|

| 1:40:03| take it in, you will be committed to justice for all. Now, if you look at the budget over the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| few years and you look at the total department spending from this year to last year to the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| after that, you will see there's been no significant changes. It's the same thing, the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6016)|
| 1:40:24| status quo. Not in O'Hara, in Lincoln Canyon. Our people are being killed in the streets the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6024)|
| 1:40:34| We passed around this paper. I think everybody in the audience should have one. If you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| make sure you don't leave without one. Let's talk about what it says. The city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| proposed budget is bad for communities. This budget would prioritize policing communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6044)|
| 1:40:51| over funding social services and affordable housing. It would give 81 million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| 81 million dollars, 81 million dollars to the police who are killing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6057)|
| 1:41:05| And yet, only giving 8 million to an affordable housing trust fund? Only 8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6065)|
| 1:41:12| It would provide an affordable housing trust fund that's actually funding gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| 8 million, almost half of that money is going to Austin Homes, which is a gentrification project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| at this point. Saying we don't want to prioritize low income, we want to prioritize medium income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Think about Austin Homes used to be East Knoxville. It is now downtown. Y'all notice that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| Gentrification, downtown expanding, pushing black people, pushing working class people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| That's what this affordable housing trust fund is supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| Subsidizing and gentrification. This budget will continue to underfund the community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6104)|

| 1:42:00| people working in that neighborhood, in that office? I want to see neighborhoods that are strong. I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| to see neighborhoods that control the development in their communities. That's what I want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| What we can't do about being underfunded. Police accountability continues to be underfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| Affordable housing, as I said, continues to be underfunded. Now, I thank the folks at Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6136)|

| 1:42:33| this crumbs, y'all. We got to fight for more than this crumbs. We need something real that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| to change our communities. This fund isn't doing that. The CAC doesn't even get a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| maybe just barely. Education, hardly anything in this budget. Community organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| hardly anything in this budget. Economic development, that benefits the few, but most of us is left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6169)|
| 1:42:58| And moreover, lastly, this budget continues to fund and provide killer cops in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6178)|

| 1:43:47| Are you going to leave any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6227)|
| 1:43:55| That's a, that's a difficult question to answer because I'm for a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6235)|
| 1:44:02| but I indeed think that there should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| major modification to the budgets that Knoxville have advanced. Knoxville has advanced over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6247)|
| 1:44:14| years. Can we stop the clock? I don't think. Mr. Montabu, I just, before you, before you proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6254)|
| 1:44:23| if you could just pause for a minute. So I just want to just let council members know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| according to your own rules, there's a limit to the speakers, three on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| So if he's speaking in favor of the budget, then there's, there's no change of rules needed. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| you're speaking against the budget, then we need to change the rules. If I must say, I am speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| against the budget as, as written. Okay. But I do think Knoxville needs a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| Okay. Just, if you could just pause for just a second, Mr. Montabu. So council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6293)|

| 1:45:59| With that said, I think this budget should correspond in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6359)|

| 1:47:15| that this is the city's ambition because we have this section of the city that's been neglected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6435)|
| 1:47:23| for generations and the deterioration is constant and insidious. We must in concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6443)|
| 1:47:33| move in a comprehensive way to mitigate this and this is the policy of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6453)|
| 1:47:42| And when we look at the budget, we can see many of the things that have been spoken to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| Knoxville has a way of avoiding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6467)|

| 1:48:17| When Knoxville was spoken to about the welfare, the empowerment zone, and how it would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| positively impact our community, Knoxville ignored us. And now we're faced with a panacea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| called the baseball stadium that is supposed to elevate again East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| So what we need in this budget is the funding of a Title VI office whose charge would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6517)|
| 1:48:49| to implement those recommendations coming from a disparity study one and a disparity study two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6529)|
| 1:49:00| We do not need $400,000 going to an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| in disparity study. This is a redundancy that is simply overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| We have the information. We need to act on it. We need $10 million annually for at least the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6551)|
| 1:49:21| 10 years going to the task force that has been developed to look into our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6561)|
| 1:49:31| That task force should not operate depending solely on money coming from outside sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| Knoxville should put its thumbprint on it. $10 million each year for at least the next 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6577)|
| 1:49:45| to mitigate the problems of which I've spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6585)|

| 1:50:18| effort on the part of Knoxville should be taken to use eminent domain to return to those who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6618)|

| 1:50:48| I thank you. Thank you. Council members, I just wanted to give a few more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| points of information about the budget. First, I am proud of this budget, and I do think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| reflects my values and reflects the values of the city. It includes a disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6660)|
| 1:51:06| Excuse me. Please be quiet. We're trying to conduct the city's business. We've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| public forum. The disparity study is included in here. We haven't had a disparity study conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| by the city since the 1990s. I listened to the Diversity Business Advisory Council, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| unanimously recommended that we do another one, and I agree, and that's proposed in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| This budget includes $100,000 to help get the African American Equity Restoration Task Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| started, staffed, and facilitated and moving forward. I'm looking forward to that. This budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| includes $2 million to invest in the Burlington community, and we're moving from, we've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6699)|
| 1:51:45| the community, we've listened, there's been enough studies, and we're moving forward with actions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| $2 million in this budget. This budget also includes evidence-based efforts to improve public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6709)|
| 1:51:57| safety. As you all know, you approved a pilot program for a co-responder model, where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| a social worker who goes with a police officer to help people who are having mental health crises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| and they're also having criminal dangerous activities at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6729)|
| 1:52:15| Guess what? It works. It has been working, and excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6735)|
| 1:52:24| thank you. This budget proposes to go from one person to four social workers to go along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| our KPD officers, and that means there would be someone seven days a week to enhance our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6750)|
| 1:52:37| efforts to increase public safety. I also fully support community-based violence interruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| models, and you know that you already supported money for this, $1 million, $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6763)|
| 1:52:51| We've gone from zero to $1 million. Thank you for doing that. We're moving forward now, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| moving forward in an evidence-based way, and we're going to tap into the capacities of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| It doesn't happen overnight. One thing this budget also proposes is a staff member that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| under the Community Empowerment Office, so someone's full-time job would be on violence interruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| and building up and tapping into those capacities. So it's hard work, and we need someone whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| full-time job is waking up every day thinking about how to do community-based violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| So in addition, I'm really proud of the affordable housing investments at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6805)|
| 1:53:32| moment because we talk about the needs of this community, and we all agreed, and at least most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| of us were at the meeting last night, that affordable housing is a crisis in Knoxville, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| this budget commits $50 million over 10 years, and this one, not just a floor of $5 million, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6823)|
| 1:53:51| $8.1 million, including $1.5 million towards permanent supportive housing, which we all know is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| effective way to help the people who need that extra support to live and be safe in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6836)|
| 1:54:04| So that's just a few points. I know we're going to delve into it more during the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| hearings next Thursday and Friday, but I did want to just mention those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| Any discussion? Council Member Singh. Thank you, Mayor. I'd like to discuss procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6853)|
| 1:54:21| At the last meeting, I felt like there were some things, when we were voting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| resolution I had put forth, there was a lot of confusion in the procedure. So I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| that we've got it right this time. Okay. So this is mainly to the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6873)|
| 1:54:41| Being a strong mayor system, if all nine of us voted against the budget, would it still go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| effect in July? Yes, it would. So to me, I would like to see more of a check and balance. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6887)|
| 1:55:00| isn't an issue with this budget necessarily. It has to do with every budget. I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6900)|
| 1:55:08| more feedback and more checks and balances, and I'm hoping that we... So I'm going to be voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| no because this feels like a performance. Well, I appreciate your comments, Council Member Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6913)|
| 1:55:27| and I do also appreciate that I had the opportunity to meet with every single member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| of City Council and hear your thoughts and proposals, and many of those are incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| into this budget. And of course, we can't always incorporate all of our ideas because we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| fiscal constraints, and I'm not proposing a tax increase, so we have to work within our means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| And yet, this budget does include incredible innovation and investments that are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| help the people of the city. So I appreciate your comments, but I do also think that I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6953)|
| 1:56:00| working with Council Members to get that input from you and your constituents. I'd like to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| to that. This is more about the procedure. You did meet. We had really good conversations about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| this, but if the basic idea is that we're having a vote that doesn't matter, that's what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6971)|
| 1:56:20| saying. Thank you. Council Member Parker. I just wanted to echo what Council Member Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6980)|
| 1:56:28| just shared and say that that is also the reason why I'm unable to vote in support of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6988)|
| 1:56:39| Thank you. Council Member Hewitt. Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Swanson, would you give us the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=6999)|
| 1:56:46| basis for the charter that conducts the city's business and how long that charter's been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| effect and how this happens to be? You're a little older than me. I thought you might know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7012)|
| 1:56:59| I'm not as old as the charter is. I know that I look older than the charter, but I'm really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| So I'm not exactly sure how long the charter has been in effect, but the charter has been in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7023)|
| 1:57:09| for longer than I've been around, and that's a few years now. And what the charter requires in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7029)|
| 1:57:16| terms of procedure is a two-reading part of the budget, and at the first reading, under Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7036)|
| 1:57:26| 901.3, I believe, of the charter, it requires that the Council adopt the Mayor's proposed budget on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7046)|
| 1:57:34| first reading and then that the Council hold its study of that budget and hold its own public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7054)|
| 1:57:42| hearing with regard to that budget, and then the budget comes up for second reading. The budget can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7062)|
| 1:57:51| be amended, but it can only be amended by department or account. It cannot be amended by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7071)|
| 1:57:59| line item issues. It can only be amended by department or account. So, for example, you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7079)|
| 1:58:06| reduce the Recreation Department's budget by $50,000 and add $50,000 to the Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7086)|
| 1:58:14| Department's budget, which can't say we're going to do away with the tennis program and add that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7094)|
| 1:58:23| pipe program, you know. So that's what your limitations are. And then it comes up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7103)|
| 1:58:31| second reading, and if the Council doesn't affirmatively adopt a budget on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| within the time limit required, I can't tell you what that date is right now, but we'll get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| the second reading on time. If the Council doesn't adopt and agree upon some budget by that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7123)|
| 1:58:53| then the Mayor's proposed budget automatically goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| Thank you, and I feel confident that that has to do with so that the City does not default on its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7138)|
| 1:59:06| bonds and all the obligations, because then the City government would cease to function without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| a budget. But I assume that is why the law was written that way, that if the Council cannot agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7152)|
| 1:59:19| to a budget by second reading, then by default the Mayor's proposed budget becomes the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7159)|
| 1:59:27| Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Singh. Thank you. I've been trying to do the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| on when an amendment to the budget has ever passed. Does anyone have that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| I don't have that information. It seems like it was back in 19...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7179)|
| 1:59:50| I think it was in the 1980s is the last time I remember a budget amendment passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7190)|
| 1:59:57| It's not that it couldn't have, it's just that that's how long it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| And I know that there have been many, many, many attempts for that, and there are a lot of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| It's difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| There are other cities that do not have the strong Mayor system where, I mean, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7212)|
| 2:00:19| it is important that we have a budget. It's important that we not shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| But I think that as a responsible Council, we would not allow that to happen, but I think some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| conversation and some negotiations and some line items or adjustments, amendments need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7231)|
| 2:00:39| available for Councils, for Council Members to be able to speak more on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| Thank you, Council Member Singh. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7245)|
| 2:00:52| I initially turned on my light because there was discussion of the Charter and I didn't mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7252)|

| 2:01:19| I see no reason for that to be a closed meeting, so I will reach out and let's bring an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7279)|
| 2:01:26| forward. The other thing that I wanted to do is I believe in previous meetings when we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7286)|
| 2:01:37| about how we are able to impact the budget or not, there was discussion of even if we were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7297)|
| 2:01:48| move funding from one area of the budget to another, the Mayor has the ability to, through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7308)|
| 2:01:58| transfers, to kind of undo what we may have done. Did we not have a discussion about how those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7318)|
| 2:02:06| transfers give the Mayor the power to, you know, even if we removed funding from KPD's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7326)|
| 2:02:14| the Mayor could then move funding back? I can't remember the particular discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| you're talking about, but any transfers would have to come to Council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| I'll have to, I'd have to go, I'll check the tape. I'll have to go check the tape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7345)|

| 2:02:36| cutting funding from the budget or adding funding from the budget. It seemed like there was a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| around City Council action from the Mayor's perspective that essentially even made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7360)|
| 2:02:49| something we're unable to do, you know, the discussion. I, yeah, still I'm not, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7369)|
| 2:02:59| have a specific thing in mind, I mean, I don't remember what you're talking about exactly, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| it's based on the law director's, former law director's opinion that you referenced at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7384)|
| 2:03:11| previous meeting. I don't, I do not remember that discussion where, when funds are directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7391)|

| 2:03:35| You're talking about John Roche's opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| John Roche's opinion really deals with the line item issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| And can you just restate that opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| Ms. Parker, could you speak a little closer to the microphone? It's sort of hard to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7426)|

| 2:04:13| It doesn't really talk about transfers. And the opinion is the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| is required to make appropriation by organizational unit, purpose or activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7458)|
| 2:04:24| and may not amend the budget document by deleting or amending specific line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| That's the opinion that's given there. There's several pages of analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| Surely you don't want me to read that. That's what the opinion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7476)|
| 2:04:44| Thank you, Ms. Parker. Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7484)|

| 2:06:02| where you decide how much you're willing to spend on it, and this is the part where you ask us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7562)|

| 2:06:18| chamber like a cudgel when it's in her favor and entirely ignores them when it is not. As I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7578)|
| 2:06:26| mentioned before, the person funded by this bill, to keep it relevant, the chair of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=7586)|

| 2:25:42| If you could speak a little bit more into your microphone, I think everyone could hear you better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| So I believe it's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8746)|
| 2:26:01| yeah, page 643, if you're looking at your packet. So under the definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8761)|
| 2:26:10| it has a definition for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8770)|
| 2:26:17| which is, you know, which is defined as housing for occupants with a certain gross income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8777)|
| 2:26:26| and then down below we see eligible use and that is defined as a program, project, or activity that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8786)|
| 2:26:36| develops, operates, preserves, rehabilitates, redevelops, or replaces affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8796)|

| 2:26:51| What I wanted to get a better clarification on is how the administration is defining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8811)|
| 2:26:58| perhaps housing or housing related services that would allow it this fund to be used towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8818)|
| 2:27:07| infrastructure alone and not that. Thank you, Ms. Parker. I'm going to ask my deputy policy chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8827)|

| 2:27:21| Absolutely. Thank you, Ms. Parker. So I'll be just very candid and say that we have intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8841)|

| 2:28:14| large-scale and small-scale supportive housing and non-supportive housing for those who are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| all levels of income, especially those extremely low and very low income in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8900)|
| 2:28:26| We also wanted it to be able to be used for tools such as, to the extent state law allows it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8906)|
| 2:28:32| community land trusts and land banks and co-ops and a variety of these other smaller tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8912)|
| 2:28:38| that our community stakeholders recognize were very intriguing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| and we wanted to ensure that we had the flexibility through this fund to support tools like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8922)|
| 2:28:50| So specific to your question around infrastructure, again, we look at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8930)|
| 2:28:57| kind of broad definitions in such a way that we can provide support to strategic initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8937)|
| 2:29:04| that would use city funding to fill gaps in a larger funding pool that support affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8944)|
| 2:29:11| housing projects and so to that degree, to the extent that that city funding is filling a gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8951)|
| 2:29:17| in terms of the portion of a larger project that would be required for infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| that would be allowable under this ordinance. Thank you, Ms. Gil, Ms. Parker. Well, and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8963)|
| 2:29:30| concerns with that interpretation of the definition because, you know, I can imagine any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8970)|
| 2:29:37| low-income, very low-income community that needs a sidewalk, well now we can pull from this fund to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8977)|
| 2:29:44| you know, bring a sidewalk to that community and I think that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| is not the intended purpose of this fund. The intended purpose of this fund should be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8989)|
| 2:29:57| increase our affordable housing stock and to do it in a way that is sustainable, which is why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=8997)|
| 2:30:03| need to invest in strategies like land trust, etc. so that these are sustainable. I had another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9003)|
| 2:30:14| question. There's, there is another section about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9014)|
| 2:30:29| oh, affordability requirement. This says when, where a disbursement and support of rental housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9029)|
| 2:30:37| is also funded by low-income housing tax credit, then the affordability term would be 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9037)|
| 2:30:47| Why the need to include the low-income housing tax credit funding? It's a, it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9047)|
| 2:30:55| So there's a couple different elements and this was a place where, again, we wanted to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| that we were allowing appropriate levels of flexibility to accommodate a wide variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9060)|
| 2:31:05| different functions that this fund might support. That said, our committee, both our stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9065)|
| 2:31:13| and particularly I want to give credit to Justice Knox for continuing to work with us on this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| because we recognize that the imperative here is that when we are supporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| for example, through our affordable rental development fund, large-scale projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9082)|
| 2:31:28| those are leveraging low-income tax credits. We don't have a state income tax credit in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| so those tax credits are exclusively federal right now. Federal tax credits do not have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9092)|
| 2:31:39| to provide much of a, a clawback, if you will, after a 15-year term, and so there is a risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9099)|
| 2:31:46| that those large multifamily properties could cease to be affordable after a 15-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| We felt extremely strongly that we wanted to ensure that those were at least affordable for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| a 30-year term, and so that allows, again, that leverage of the private sector capital to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9115)|
| 2:32:02| support for projects such as those on GAP and these other larger-scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9122)|
| 2:32:07| multi-unit initiatives while also, again, allowing ourselves the flexibility to recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9127)|
| 2:32:14| hopefully, a stretch toward permanent affordability where possible and whenever possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| but recognizing that many of these projects, when we're trying to get to a scale and address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| urgent need for more, more homes in Knoxville, that we can do that in a way that leverages funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| while also ensuring the affordability term will be there for a long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9147)|
| 2:32:35| It, yeah, it seems to definitely target an area that we need to target to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9155)|
| 2:32:44| long-term affordability, but I can imagine other uses of this fund where we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9164)|
| 2:32:50| also want that 30-year period, and I imagine there would be an expectation in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9170)|
| 2:32:58| for that 30-year period to be in place. Is there a reason why you didn't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9178)|
| 2:33:06| include language that would allow this affordability period to be prioritized for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9186)|
| 2:33:12| projects funded by this fund? So, I'll also emphasize, I think you're hitting on an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| point and one that we really wanted to focus on as well, and again, our goal here is to stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| toward permanent affordability whenever possible. In no way does this ordinance constrain our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9201)|
| 2:33:25| ability to require that 30-year or permanent affordability when that is viable and when that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9205)|
| 2:33:31| is appropriate. So, this ordinance does not tie our hands in that regard and in fact pushes us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| to ensure that we are maintaining that minimum while at the same time giving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| flexibility to make those additional long-term requirements wherever we can find it appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9220)|
| 2:33:46| and I think that's an important consideration that the guidelines, that again, we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9226)|
| 2:33:52| bake all of our rules into ordinance. We want to give ourselves administrative flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| and so that is again going to be an important role of the advisory committee in working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9236)|
| 2:34:01| the city to confirm the guidelines that would apply to any number of different programs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9241)|
| 2:34:06| might be supported with this fund. Okay, and then my last point of clarification is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9246)|
| 2:34:14| there are income limits set for the distribution, the first one of the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9254)|
| 2:34:19| and it says 65 percent of the appropriations and contributions disbursed should benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9259)|
| 2:34:34| households earning 60 percent AMI, and then any remainder of such appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9274)|
| 2:34:43| should be for those below 80 percent. However, a few points below that, it says that the director of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9283)|
| 2:34:58| yeah, the director of housing and neighborhood development shall set annual goals for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9298)|
| 2:35:04| um disbursement of funds for those at or below 50 percent of AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9304)|
| 2:35:12| What is the expectation there if we have 65 percent under 60 percent, the rest are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9312)|
| 2:35:22| to be under 80 percent, but I guess that that remaining amount that's allowed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9322)|
| 2:35:29| within 80 percent, we really need targets for within 50 percent. So I think what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| cuing on is again the ordinance intentionally being structured such that we prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9335)|
| 2:35:41| by code a certain level of minimum funding that must be allocated to support what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9341)|
| 2:35:46| consider very low income groups that fall below a 60 percent AMI threshold. So again, this was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9346)|
