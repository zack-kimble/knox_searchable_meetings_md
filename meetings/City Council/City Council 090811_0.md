| 0:02:15| Councilman Roddy did ask if we would let you know she's sorry she can't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| She has a medical situation involving one of her daughters and expressed her regret about not being able to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| I'd like to vote to approve the minutes of our meeting of July the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Any additions, corrections, deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| Mayor Haslund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Yes, I would move that item number 11-I be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| Just a moment, a bit of explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| I believe that that is not quite ready for our council to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| And so it's going to be withdrawn until it's ready to be presented at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| As opposed to a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| It's a withdrawal as opposed to a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| It's going to require a little bit more time, I think, for preparation is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| I don't think there's a date certain when we could, so we'll withdraw it and bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| Is there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Okay, 11-I is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| Any other items withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Any ayes for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| And I don't believe we have any consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| So that will take us to item 6-A, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| 6-A is an application for renewal of a certificate of compliance for Arthur C. Ely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=222)|

| 0:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| First, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| First, I would like to remind people that this Saturday is Happy Hollerpalooza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| Things start at 10 a.m. down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| but starting at 4 o'clock will be the street fair component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| And North Central between Baxter Avenue and, well, East and West Scott Avenue will be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| Then there's going to be two different stages with music on each stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| There will be Tai Chi demonstrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Restaurants will be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| And I'm sure the Friso will be at full tilt serving up good desserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| I remind folks to come out for that this Saturday, August the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=395)|
| 0:06:42| I've got something else, but I'll mention it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Ms. Pilum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Well, I just wanted to remind everyone, perhaps people were not even aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| that on Friday, the 21st of August, is Bearden Heritage Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| It's been very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| They have spent a couple of mornings receiving comments and information from people who know a great deal about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=420)|
| 0:07:08| Bearden history and heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| And that is the day to celebrate the heritage and history of the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| So I just thought it might interest a number of people who might be listening to listen a bit more for information about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=436)|
| 0:07:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| I think council knows that the Ridge Top and Slope Protection Task Force has had a series of meetings, public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| that have followed an extensive amount of work by volunteers and supported by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| Councilman Pilo was at the meeting yesterday evening at Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| That eight meetings so far, those were all that were scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| We've added an additional public meeting due to requests from folks in the far west, including county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| So there will be one more opportunity as far as this series of public meetings go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| And that's on Monday, the 17th of August at 630 at Farragut Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| So anybody that's wanted to be a part of that or hear the discussion or the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| hasn't had a chance to make a meeting yet, but we do have another opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| Again, that's Monday, the 17th at 630 p.m. at Farragut Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Second item, this past week, Mr. Swanson emailed people on council his opinion and that of the city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=509)|
| 0:08:39| concerning the present issue of whether or not guns are to be allowed in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| It's a matter of a scheduling issue since we have a workshop presently planned for Thursday, August the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| with an item that Vice Mayor Becker has on the agenda for August the 25th, two weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| At this point, I'd like to call upon Mr. Swanson to discuss this topic, where things stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| and his apparent conversation with the Vice Mayor earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| Well, as all of you know, the state legislature in this past session adopted a statute which essentially provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| that it would be lawful for persons who carry permit holders to have guns in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=565)|
| 0:09:35| but provided a provision within that statute for localities to opt out of that legislation if the locality chose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=575)|
| 0:09:46| And you have pending before this council a resolution that was sponsored by Vice Mayor Bob Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=586)|
| 0:09:56| to opt out of that particular legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| Late in July, after doing some legal research, the metro attorney in Nashville offered an opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| a formal opinion, which pointed out that in the legislation where the state took over the field of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=609)|
| 0:10:19| or not you could bear firearms in parks, one of the things that the legislature did, or in that statute they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| was they exempted any ordinance that was valid before June the 8th of 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| So if you had an ordinance that was valid that prohibited the possession or use of firearms in parks before June the 8th of 1986,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=632)|
| 0:10:43| it remained a valid ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| And in Nashville, they did have such an ordinance, as a result of which it was the opinion of the metro law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| that it was not necessary for Nashville to adopt the opt-out resolution because they already had a valid ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| which was an enforceable ordinance that would prohibit the use or possession of firearms in the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| We looked at that opinion and looked at it fairly carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| And the city of Knoxville also has on its records section, Knoxville City Code Section 20-60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=671)|
| 0:11:21| which prohibits the use or possession of guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| And that particular ordinance was valid and in effect prior to June the 8th of 1986, well before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=686)|
| 0:11:35| As a result of that and looking at both the legislation and looking at the metro opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| it's my opinion that we are in the same situation as metro Davidson County in that we don't have to adopt the opt-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=701)|
| 0:11:53| resolution in order for the possession or use of guns in parks to be prohibited by our ordinance, Knoxville City Code Section 20-60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=713)|
| 0:12:03| So having offered that opinion to you and sent it around to you by e-mail, Mr. Becker, Vice Mayor Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=723)|
| 0:12:13| is out of town, out of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| But he called me today from out of the country and in a very short conversation because he told me it was a very expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| conversation, but in that very short conversation, he thanked me for forwarding that opinion to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=741)|
| 0:12:29| And he expressed his opinion in terms of scheduling to let you all know that he was perfectly happy to withdraw the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=749)|
| 0:12:39| that he is sponsoring with regard to the opt-out provision of that state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| And that in his opinion, he would also support that if he's not going to sponsor that resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| that it would not be necessary to have a workshop with regard to that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| And so he wanted me to pass those words along to you with regard to the scheduling of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| So at this point, Mr. Swanson, what are our options considering he's going to withdraw that resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| The basis of the workshop was the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| If the resolution is withdrawn, you can do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| And if you do nothing, then the possession and use of firearms in parks will be prohibited under Knoxville City Code Section 2060.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=800)|
| 0:13:30| So one option you have is to do nothing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| One option you have is to do both of those things, have that valid ordinance in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| and adopt the opt-out resolution if you desire to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| And I guess another option would be to sponsor an ordinance that would repeal Section 2060,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=823)|
| 0:13:52| which is a valid ordinance prohibiting the use and possession of firearms in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| As best I can tell, that's about your three options that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| And considering the next legislative sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| there are probably going to be a further refinement of the guns in parks issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Well, I have heard through the grapevine that there are some issues related to that legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| where some folks have some questions about whether they actually did what they intended to do with that legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| and whether or not there might be some holes in that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| And they're going to be cleaning that legislation up at the next state legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| So that's certainly a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| And what you all may wish to consider, and this is entirely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| It's a policy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| It's a legal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| But you could consider also just waiting until that legislation is addressed at the next session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| and then deciding what you're going to do after that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Let me just ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| How do other folks on council feel if this is going to get addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| and Vice Mayor Becker is going to withdraw the resolution, which was the basis of the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| I mean, considering it's set for next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| and this is the last time which we'll gather before then as a matter of fairness to the public, what do folks feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=905)|
| 0:15:18| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| I guess one option we have is for the city recorder's office, Ms. Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| to poll the council members to see if we want to go along with the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| I, for one, think that at some point the workshop would be beneficial and productive and informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| And to hear that debate, I think, is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| Not knowing really what Councilman Becker is going to do yet and or if he does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| if any other council member would move with a repeal of the current ordinance or a revision of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=948)|
| 0:15:57| Knowing that the state legislature has found that this has a number of holes in it, problems with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| inconsistencies with it, that they're going to review this in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| You know, I think I don't know if we're going to want to try to have a workshop with this council or the next council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=971)|
| 0:16:19| It's probably not necessary to have a workshop this coming Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| I think in terms of the public, we probably ought to make that known as soon as possible because I know there are a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=984)|
| 0:16:32| that want to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| So, at this point, I would be in favor of canceling the workshop and seeing what happens with Councilman Becker's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=994)|
| 0:16:43| and if any other council member wants to move in some other direction and deal with the current state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| But I think at this point there's no real reason to move on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| I'll go to Councilwoman Pelo and then I'll come back to this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Well, I would just comment that in light of the information that was forwarded to us earlier in the week by e-mail from Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1018)|
| 0:17:06| and in light of the fact that apparently the state legislature has determined that it's necessary to return to the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1026)|
| 0:17:15| and do some clarification on that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| I would think that at this point in time we're just better served as a city council not to take any action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| until we know how the legislature is going to eventually come down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| And I realize that that is going to mean that five of us would not be here to pass judgment on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| or to cast a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| And I really think it would be much wiser, in my mind, for us just to cancel the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| and to await the beginning of the new year when it's clear what it is that council has to, has before them on which to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1070)|
| 0:18:00| And then I think the workshop would have a lot of validity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| And I imagine a lot of us would want to be here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Well, I have some mixed feelings about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| I actually think that it would be good, beneficial to have the workshop because there have been a number of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| that are very concerned about this issue, and actually I think it would be beneficial to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| Whether we, there's any action taken or not, we would get a good feel for what the public at large think about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Councilman Hoekstra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Well, I hear what Councilman Hall is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| And I tend to agree that we need, that this body, before it takes any action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| really needs to initiate an adequate process to get input from people that have varying opinions on the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| or issues, if you will, related to what we thought we were going to vote on at the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1136)|
| 0:19:05| Given that there's certainly a lot of uncertainty, other than it appears that the present resolution will be with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| probably be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Beyond that, there's uncertainty in terms of any proposed action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| I think my sense is that a workshop on next, to be held next Thursday would be premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| But I think we need to make that decision, and I don't see why we can't make it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| So I think we could do that in the form of a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| And, Mayor, since you're in the chair seat, you might be the best one to conduct that straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| But I think maybe that's the way to address it to see whether or not we should proceed ahead with the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| You didn't actually make a motion, but you had first said to have the city council office poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| Is everybody okay with doing a straw poll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| I mean, I'll look for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| That way, the media, well, some of the media is here, and certainly Hubert Smith is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1196)|
| 0:20:06| People are watching on Channel 12, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| It's more likely that that word will get out sooner and more effectively this way, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| than if we poll council members later, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| I will throw out one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| I do think Councilman Hall makes a good point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| I do think there are a lot of people that want to be heard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| It is, obviously, a very contentious issue with arguments that need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| So I do think there's some value in having the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Now, I understand your arguments that it may come up next year and the law may change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| It might not, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| So I do think there's some value to having that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| and I know there's a large crowd of people that are ready to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| You've probably gotten their e-mails, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Then I'm going to do this, and I'm going to take a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| I'm going to ask you to raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| If you're in favor of canceling not having the workshop on the 20th, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| Raising your hand means you're in favor of not having the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven in favor, and then one would like to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Is that right, Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| You know, I just want to go on the record say I am very much for a workshop, just not this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| I think, you know, we need the nine of us to move forward, and they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| So in terms of the public, I think we need to cancel it Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| I mean, something might come on the agenda at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| But like I said, the basis of Thursday's workshop was what was going to be on Tuesday's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| If it's going to be withdrawn, something else could be put on at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Councilman Holquist just correctly corrected my math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| That would be six in favor and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| And there's only seven, and my seven and one would be impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| You're not going to have anything to do with the state budget, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| I do think, like I said, there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| One of the values in the workshop, there is some difference in whether we stay under the city ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| or the state ordinance in terms of the penalty for carrying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| So there are some differences in things that need to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| So staying with the city ordinance and not opting out, there is in Debbie or Charles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| you all can correct me if I'm wrong, but there are some differences even in that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| One of the key differences is under the city ordinance is it doesn't criminalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| And so, yeah, it prohibits it, but it doesn't turn somebody that has a carrying permit that's carrying inside a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| city park into a criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| That is the key difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| For right now, we stand with the workshop for the 20th has been canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| And did Councilman Becker say that he was going to withdraw the item for the 25th, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| If that was the will of council, that's what he intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| It appears to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| It appears to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| So I would encourage you then in your e-mail correspondence to let folks know that accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Well, no, I just think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| I think our vote was with the understanding that that is going to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| My vote might have been different had I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| That's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| To me, yes, that's an extremely important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| That's a great, great, great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Ready to move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1408)|

| 0:24:14| property located at 1900 Martha Berry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| It's in the 4th District, and it's in conjunction with Resolution 11N,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| which is a resolution approving the appeal by Phyllis Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| There are several folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Actually, all of those signed up to speak are in favor of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| So, I'm going to go ahead and take those as is council's habit unless somebody directs me not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1478)|

| 0:24:46| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| And Melissa West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| And Ms. Severance is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| And if all of you will come to the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| and start by giving us your name and your address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1492)|
| 0:25:02| Mr. Mayor, members of City Council, I'm Phyllis Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| I live at 1911 Martha Berry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| I am here representing my neighbors, some who live on Ridgecrest Drive and some who live on Martha Berry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| We are here to ask you to overturn the decision of the Board of Zoning concerning the property that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| Kenneth Mason owns at the corner of Ridgecrest, Martha Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| and across from Nottingham intersection with Ridgecrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| This is an old established neighborhood in Fountain City known as Bell Carroll Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| which was established in 1953.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| Mr. Mason has owned this property since 2006 when it was zoned as R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| In 2007, our neighborhood acquired zoning of R1EN in order to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| and preserve the integrity of the prevalent building character in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| Mr. Mason told me that he does not plan to build a home on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| He just wants to recoup his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| However, in a meeting in the Board of Zoning office, I was shown a map of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| and Mr. Mason had drawn house lines on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| I asked Mr. Mason if he was not going to build a house, why did he draw lines on the house for a house on the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| He told me that was the only way he could get an application for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| In my opinion, his representation of his intentions has neither been honest with the zoning office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| nor with us, the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| With respect to Mr. Mason, we appreciate his desire to sell and recoup his investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| We recognize and respect an owner's right to develop his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| However, he has told us he does not plan to develop this property, only to sell his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| We do not have a personal vendetta against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| However, we do question his commitment to the neighborhood and have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| First of all, the granting of the variance was for personal reasons, citing a hardship for the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| rather than being based on the objective facts of this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| We, the neighbors, those who actually live in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| see this as a blatant disregard for the neighborhood's will and voice with the result of compromising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| and lift the aesthetic and construction requirements stipulated in R1EN zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| Secondly, R1EN regulations apply to new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| Thus, we cite the following specific concerns related to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| and any potential development that would occur as a result of the zoning variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| In Article 4, Section 2C of the Knoxville Code, page 2622, it states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| R1EN zoning establishes dimensional regulations that can complement the prevalent development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| and residential design requirements that reflect the prevalent building character of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| The district is intended to provide for neighborhood stability while allowing continued development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| that is in harmony with the existing development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| Section 2E, dealing with dimensional and density regulations, states that for each primary use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| except duplexes, there shall be a minimum lot area of not less than 22,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| Mr. Mason's property is only 13,527 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| Section E3 states for each house or duplex, the minimum depth of the front yard shall be equal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| to the average plus or minus 10 feet of development lots on the same street within 500 feet of the subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| but not less than 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| The variance granted to Mr. Mason reduced the street frontage on Martha Berry from 40 feet to 28 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| To allow the frontage of 28 feet, which Mr. Mason desires, could hardly complement the prevalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| and well-established development pattern in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Therefore, we are asking you to please overturn the decision of the Board of Zoning regarding this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Ms. Minnette, sorry, you can tell us the right way to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1729)|
| 0:28:57| Give us your name and address, and you also have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| Mr. Mayor, you did very well with my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| It's Paula Minnette, and I married a southern boy from Buckhead, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| He and I live at 2104 Martha Berry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| And I would like to speak on behalf of our neighborhood for the safety of the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| I have some pictures that I'd like to give out to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| because I have -- I'd like for you to visualize with me our children trying to catch the school bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| in the neighborhood, early morning traffic with a three-way intersection, and a proposed driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1771)|
| 0:29:41| And Mr. Mason surely wants to put a driveway in to reach the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| or the new buyer of the property would want an access into the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| So may I bring these pictures up and dispense with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| If you'll give them to Mr. King there, he'll make sure then you can have your full time allotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| Oh, it won't take me long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| I'll just wait a minute until you all get your pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| We have around ten children on Martha Berry and probably six or seven over on Ridgecrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1818)|
| 0:30:26| And the school bus stops at the intersection going to Gresham at Martha Berry, Nottingham, and Ridgecrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1826)|
| 0:30:39| You all just tell me when you get a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| This is a staged photograph because this is summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| The bus, the school is not in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| And we rounded up some children from the neighborhood to go down to the bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1854)|
| 0:31:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Go ahead, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I think we're all --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Everybody got a picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| You can see this is the three-way section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| And Martha Berry, Ridgecrest, and Nottingham is over beside the blue van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| The children are waiting at the bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Mr. Mason's property is on the left side of the photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| And his property is a triangle property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| One side is on Martha Berry and the other side is on Ridgecrest for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| The third side joins the property with Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| And she'll be speaking next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Now, whether the future owner of the property puts an access drive on Martha Berry or on Ridgecrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1904)|
| 0:31:53| look at the photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| There's a car coming down Martha Berry, a car coming from Ridgecrest, a car coming toward Ridgecrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| And there's one obvious thing missing in the photograph, the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| We staged this during the summer and we, of course, don't have a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| So when you think about the congestion and then add in the morning walkers who are doing their walk for exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| add in the morning dog lovers who are taking their dogs out for a walk, add in the traffic speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1940)|
| 0:32:31| There is speeding problems on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| It really is very congested in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| And I know this because I go to work every morning and I see the school children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| I see the school bus and I see all of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Now, if you add another access road, whether it be on Ridgecrest or Martha Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| I think it would just be a safety issue for the children trying to get to their school bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| and to get on the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| And that is my plea and my argument that you all uphold our side of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1987)|
| 0:33:16| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Not right now, but I bet they might later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Ms. West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2004)|
| 0:33:37| Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Melissa West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| and I am the property owner at 1906 Martha Berry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| My property is adjacent to the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| and I support the appeal of the variance that was granted to Mr. Mason on June 18 by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| There is a discrepancy of more than 10 feet at the property line facing northeast on Martha Berry Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| and 9 feet to the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Mr. Mason's request is not based on an official recorded survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| which may offer the actual setback lines on Martha Berry Drive as well as the actual square feet of the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| Mr. Mason has made threats to my property in regard to the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| and has also made false statements to the Zoning Board in regards to my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| without a proper survey to prove his statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| I would like to provide the City Council members with a copy of my property survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| which has been accepted by the City of Knoxville and is on file with the Registrar of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| Also, Mr. Mason has requested the zoning appeal due to a hardship of being able to sell this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| because of the R1EN zoning of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| I do not feel that this is a hardship for Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| I know that there has been at least one party interested in personally purchasing the property from Mr. Mason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| without changing the R1EN setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| I also feel that the hardship is due to the present state of the economy, his asking price for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| and a real estate agent other than zoning restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Due to the topography of the location of the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| I feel that reducing the setback on Martha Berry Drive could pose an unnecessary danger to vehicles exiting my driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| on to Martha Berry Drive by permanently hindering the ability to observe oncoming traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| if a dwelling or even a privacy fence is erected at 28 feet from Martha Berry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| I would also like to say in closing that I'm very disappointed in the Board of Zoning chose to grant Mr. Mason the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| against the voice of the people who are residents of Knox County, the City of Knoxville, and Bell Coral Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| I feel that we, as residents of this neighborhood, are responsible for protecting the character of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| from developers whose only goal is to make a profit with no regard to the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| I sincerely hope that you consider my concerns as you make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| I'd like to provide you with a copy of my survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| You can bring them up and we'll pass those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| That's all the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| I don't think there's anyone signed up to speak against the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| There's no one signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Is there anyone in the audience that wants to speak against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| I do know Mr. Mason contacted me and said he was going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Oh, he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Mr. Mason, would you obviously have the right to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| And you also have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I'm Kenneth Mason, and I live at 729 Deerfoot Drive in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| And I thank you very much for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Yes, this does create a hardship on me and my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| As you can see, I'm not a young man anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| We bought this in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Yes, I was going to build on it, but as you know, the economy has turned sour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| And I couldn't borrow any money to build if I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| But let me tell you what we will be missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| The economy is not, in my lifetime, has been this bad since I've been born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| There's more people out of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| The city would lose the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| The county would lose the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| All the people that would be working on this project would lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| And we have a lot of people don't understand what's in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| First you apply for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| That would be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Then you go and get a grading contractor, laborers, carpenters, painters, electricians, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2256)|
| 0:37:46| All these people would be losing because the neighbors are not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Now, I'm sorry, but this property was on R1 when I bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| And I bought it from a friend of mine that's owned it for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| And I didn't buy it with the intention of ever disturbing the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| I've never met Ms. Severance in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| And she says that I told her that I wasn't going to build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| I may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| I talked to her on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| But, you know, it's my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| I can build on it because the zoning board has approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| I request that we let that decision stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| And I'd like to ask Ms. Severance what age her children are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| And if this alleged bus stop is really there, how do we propose me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| or anyone else that ever builds on this property to get to the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| I mean, every piece of property has to have access to a city road, county road, or a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2325)|
| 0:38:54| And I request that you would stand by this decision by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2334)|
| 0:39:03| Not only this, I've got a brother that I've had the lot, yes, for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| But as you can tell, there's no buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| But you put a piece of property on the real estate market, if it don't sell, they don't get any money either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| So, anyway, we're hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Me and my wife are in desperate shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I don't work anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| And I'm sorry that the neighbors feel the way they do about me, but we really need to stand with this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Those speaking in favor have two minutes for a response if you would like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| One representative does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2381)|
| 0:39:53| The neighbors are split on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| We're not really against a house being built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| We would like to see what kind of house is planned to be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| Two weeks ago, I spoke with Andy Mason, who Mr. Mason referred to as your brother, the realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2405)|
| 0:40:15| He told me he would have the builder call us and come to meet with all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| and show us the house that's been drawn up to be put on that property by a lady who apparently wants to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| That phone call was never made back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| We have no vendetta with Mr. Mason whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| We just are very interested in the type of home that's going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| Also, regarding where the driveway was drawn on the map we saw at the Board of Zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| it's right there as you see at the very tip end of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| That's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| The driveway possibly could be moved somewhere else, but right there at that tip end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| and that big yellow bus trying to make that turn, that's a very narrow road, Marthabury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| And they come up Marthabury to get to Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| So that is also an issue, that and what sort of home will be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| It's not that we're against a house being put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| It's just we'd like to see what they plan to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Comments from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| I would like, if Ms. Cash is prepared to comment on this, I would call hearing this at the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| And if you are prepared to comment, can you, Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| We did receive a request for the Board of Zoning Appeals from Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Move a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| To reduce the setbacks on Marthabury and on Ridgecrest and in the rear yard setback or side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| Unfortunately, because this is a corner lot, he does have to observe the front yard setbacks on both Marthabury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| and Ridgecrest, which does reduce his square footage buildable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| I think, first off, I should tell you that this property is zoned R1EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| And anything that is built there, in addition to getting approval from our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| also has to go to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for review, which he has not done yet, I do not believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| The driveway that was shown on the plan that was submitted at the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| we did advise Mr. Mason that that driveway was probably not going to be approved, not only by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2543)|
| 0:42:32| but also by the City Engineering Department and that it would have to be relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| This property, as Mr. Mason said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| the map that was submitted at the Board of Zoning Appeals indicates that in 1971 this property was zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2560)|
| 0:42:48| And the R1EN zoning regulations were only created a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| So the zoning was changed by the Metropolitan Planning Commission and by the City on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| But, again, he would have to go to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for approval for anything that he built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| Well, that was my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| I just appreciate you clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| I'll let Mr. Hall go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Well, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I don't know who it would go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| With the variance that he's been granted, he would still have to change the driveway location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2603)|
| 0:43:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| He did not get a variance for the placement of the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| and there are requirements within the zoning ordinance that do not allow you to place a driveway within so many feet of an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| On a lot that's like this, and I've been by this piece of property, it so he would probably have to come from either close to the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2626)|
| 0:43:59| of this piece of property substantially back from that corner location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| But before this was zoned, this R1EN, he could have built the house that he had sort of sketched out here without the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2646)|
| 0:44:23| in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| He wouldn't have needed the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Let me follow up on the driveway issue that Councilman Hall raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| He still, the R1EN, the city engineering had to sign off on the location of the driveway due to its proximity to the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2676)|
| 0:44:45| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| The city of Knoxville Engineering Department has to sign off on every driveway that's installed regardless of where it's placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| There are provisions in the zoning ordinance that require it to be so far away from the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| So that's not a function of zoning, that's a function of traffic engineering, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| No, it is in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| It is a provision in the zoning ordinance, and it is signed off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Well, maybe I misheard, but what Councilman Hall got to was R1EN zone would not allow the present location of the driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2710)|
| 0:45:21| but R1 zoning would allow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| No, he said without the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| He wouldn't have needed the setback location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| That's what I understood him to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Councilman Hulkos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Mr. Donaldson, under R1EN, what review authority would the MPC have over proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2736)|
| 0:45:46| and would that be a staff review or would it have to go to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| MPC staff would review the front elevation of the house to make sure it complies with the design requirements that are in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2752)|
| 0:46:02| But it is a staff review of the front elevation only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Only front elevation, not footprint, not number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| Would that include the height or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| The height is the same as R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| So the review of the front elevation would encompass what then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| The orientation of the elevation to the street, the percentage of window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| and door fenestration on the front facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| Some design elements have to be included on the front elevation from a menu that's included in the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2796)|
| 0:46:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Would you care to comment any further on the driveway review process when it comes to city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| and what your guidelines are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| Well, I think they've pretty much described it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| But the zoning ordinance requires for a residential zone that the driveway be located a certain distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2826)|
| 0:47:15| from the intersection of two right-of-way lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| And in addition to that, we look for safe locations for driveways to be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2838)|
| 0:47:26| although there isn't a specific regulation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| We do evaluate that and try to locate driveways in safe locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| But there is, like Ms. Cash mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| a specific regulation about the driveway from the intersection of two streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Mr. Mason, would you mind stepping back up to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| Would you say that this lot would be unbuildable without a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| It would be unbuildable without the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Totally unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Because of the deed requirements of 1,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| Well, you couldn't get 1,000 square feet on this piece of property without the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| You heard a comment that someone that's related to you, his last name is also Mason, was going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| There was a statement that this person was going to try to set up a meeting between perhaps you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2908)|
| 0:48:37| perhaps you're certainly the builder, I believe, or a proposed builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| I don't know who that would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| You don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| I have no idea what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| It wasn't me that said it, and I don't know who they talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| I don't have a buyer for the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| You don't have a buyer for the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Do you see any value in meeting with your neighbors to talk to them about what could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| or could not be built on the parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| I haven't because I have never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| I've just rough sketched what I thought I could get on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| I have no plans right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| It's possible that if a variance were, if the appeal were denied and the variance was upheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| that this council could uphold it in its entirety or in part or even condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Could we further condition a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| You could, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| So if you were to meet with your neighbors, the neighbors there, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| the folks in the neighborhood on Martha Berry Drive that are opposed to this variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| and work out something because Ms. Severance said that they're not opposed to something being built on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| They just want to know what's going to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| So would you be willing to meet with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| and have a discussion to see if you could find some middle ground or some acceptable agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=2999)|
| 0:50:09| some level of agreement or place of agreement where everybody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| you could say, okay, I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| That makes it buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| And they say, we can live with those pieces of the agreement that define what can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| Because this council can then approve, if you all can come to an understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| this council could approve that understanding probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| Well, I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| I definitely wouldn't build nothing that wouldn't make the neighborhood better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| I certainly wouldn't try to build something that would dissatisfy the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| I'm glad to hear you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Does that mean that you're willing to meet with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Well, then I think perhaps this council should consider a postponement as we often do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| in these circumstances to let them, let the parties talk it out and see if they can come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| I have nothing at this time on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| I don't have any drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| But the variance, if it were granted, could be conditioned based on an agreement that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| and the neighbors to that property struck, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Yes, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| And I'm not saying it is possible, but it's worth exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Would you not agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| But what I couldn't possibly satisfy the neighbors and MPC probably at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| But I don't want to be stretched out and can't do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| Well, we're not talking about the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| We're talking about the neighbors, you, the neighbors, and this city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| Those are the three parties that are engaged at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| The driveway is not important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| And I did have a city engineer when I went up with this little sketch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| And he redid the driveway for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| I didn't have nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Send material to me if I come off of Ridgecrest or Marthabury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| It sounds like you're willing to talk about it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Well, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Well, I don't represent that district, so I'm maybe not the best person to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Well, I'll just go ahead and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| We have the folks who filed the appeal that are here tonight, how they asked one of their representatives to step forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| and discuss their feelings on that issue, whether it's Ms. Severance or Minahat or West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3142)|
| 0:52:46| Ms. Severance, I think the question is there's been suggestions that there be a postponement to let both sides talk about it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| And I think Councilman Frost is saying, does that seem like a good idea to you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| We're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| How long do you all think it would take to get together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| The next meeting is August the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| Why don't you step up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Like I said, I have no plans whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| But what I told them was Andy Mason does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Well, Andy Mason doesn't own this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| And neither do you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| But Mr. Mason told me that he had a buyer and they had to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Mr. Mason didn't tell you anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| I'm Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| No, Andy Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Are you willing to sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Can you all meet in the next two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Do you need four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| What we're trying to decide is I think there's a general sentiment I sense and to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| and not decide tonight to let the two parties see if they can come up with something that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| The question is do you need two weeks or four weeks to have that conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| I don't think that you could ever please this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| Well, but I think Councilman Holt was asked if you were willing to sit down and meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| Basically, Ms. Severance, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| She didn't answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Well, we can't solve that argument here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| I asked you what age your children were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| I think there's a general, I think what Council is urging both sides is can you sit down and have a conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| see if you can work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| And I would just, Mr. Frost, would you like to suggest either two or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| I'll let you make that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Do you think you can do it in two weeks or four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| And Mr. Hall has a question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| I can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| We can do it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Mr. Mason, are you planning on building something on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| or are you going to sell this piece of property and you'll be up to somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| I may do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| I don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| I have no plans to build in any time in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| But any building I ever built is going to look better than anything in that property, in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| And I guess that's the reason for my question was if he sits down with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| and they agree on something and then he sells it to Rob Frost, Rob Frost may not agree to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| And if we condition the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Mr. Hall, you have made the point that seems to be the point that needs to be made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| And my question and the question is, if I think I understand this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| if Mr. Mason is granted his variance, I mean, we deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| That doesn't mean he can go tomorrow and build anything he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| He still has to go before EMPC and get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| That seems to be where the problem would lie with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| Because at this point, there is nothing to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| It's just a matter of whether you can build something on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| Is that pretty well true, Mr. Mason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| So, I mean, anything Mr. Mason, it's different if Mr. Mason is going to be the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| He's going to build something versus, you know, he's got a piece of property for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| There's no telling what an owner may or may not want to build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| Mr. Donaldson, would you like to add something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Keep in mind that that approval at EMPC is a staff approval and not by the planning commission itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| So it's not subject to a public hearing with the notice that everybody's used to as far as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| So it is just a staff approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Do they meet the requirements or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| If they meet them, then they go upstairs and get a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Councilman Hall, I didn't mean to cut you off, but anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| I'm just wondering at this point, based on the conversations and that we do not have a present house plan in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| it's not being considered, he's not ready to go building, pull building permits or anything like that or submit to EMPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| Is there a reason to postpone this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| I mean, Mr. Mason, you seem to indicate that, I mean, you seem to be a strong-willed individual, which, of course, is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3428)|
| 0:57:16| Is there a, I mean, are you willing to sit down and talk to these folks and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| I can place my driveway elsewhere or maybe I don't need this big of a setback on the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| on the front yards and the side going down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| I'm not going to, Mr. Hall, I think MPC should approve my drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| If they approve it, then it's up to the neighbors to disapprove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Anita, Ms. Cash had something she wanted to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| I just want to say that variances are approved based on a site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| So the site plan that he got his variances on is the site plan you have in your packet that looks just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3483)|
| 0:58:11| If he changes his site plan and he needs another variance or a different variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| he has to go back to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| This is all he can build on this law with these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| At this point, you know, I've talked to Mrs. Severance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| and some neighborhood representatives on the phone and outside the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| I'm not sure if there's really going to be any common ground to be found in a meeting as much as I, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| like to ask people to sit down together and break bread and see what they can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Other people can certainly feel free to disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| That's the feeling I'm getting from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| I know Councilman Bailey has his light on as well as Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| I'll go with Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Go ahead, Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Well, I hear what you're saying, Councilman Frost, but I think it's worth a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| So I'm going to make a motion to postpone this for four weeks so that the parties can see if they can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3551)|
| 0:59:11| And if they can't, then this council can decide in spite of their ability, disability to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| There's a motion to postpone it for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| I'll come back to you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Mr. Bailey, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| Well, I just wanted to say, you know, we hear these appeals and these variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| and we listen to neighborhoods and we've got several of them that are pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| One in particular, Mr. Kochen, coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| And then we talk about the character of neighborhoods and we talk about upholding, you know, the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| And if you've been out there and you look at this piece of property and you look at that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| what he has sketched out here is not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| It's really, you know, these lots are large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| They're spacious, big setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| And you can't, this is just not consistent with the character of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| But having said that, Mr. Mason, you know, you eventually can build something on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| and you're going to have to go through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| But in order to get some type of variance like this, you know, you really need to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| and demonstrate what you're going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| And what Mr. Hall is talking about is if you get this variance, you can go sell the variance to a builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| And then it's out of everyone's control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Although, you know, I guess it would have to go through that process, but it goes to the staff of the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| So there's little elected official, you know, we're elected to hear these appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| And so I think, you know, from where I'm sitting over here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| you either need to show them what you're going to do and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| you can only build so much on that lot in terms of compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| So, you know, I'm over here looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| And I always try to support people's property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| But, I mean, you can only, when you're asking for a variance, you can only do so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| If it's not compatible, I'm sitting here saying I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| Well, how can I be compatible when I've just got so much property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Well, I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| It was approved in 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| Now it's disapproved just because you've changed the zoning on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| I know you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| That leaves me and my wife in a pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| And I'm all for you getting your money out of it or making money or profiting from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| But when you, you know, when this is what we're looking at and I look at the R1EN zoning, it's not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3702)|
| 1:01:50| And that's what I'm up here to decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Right now the motion on the floor is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| There's a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| All those in favor of postponing for four weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| I heard a Mr. Frost with a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| I heard six in favor of postponing for four weeks and one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| So, the item will be postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| I think the strong sense of counsel is that both sides get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| and understand the issues and have a good discussion prior to coming back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Let me respectfully request the Friday before the meeting, each of you all independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| or each side independently communicates to counsel by that time whether or not they've met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| and whether or not anything has been worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| So, hopefully we can have a streamlined process for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| and D&D Developers, Inc. to provide empowerment zone funds in the amount of $521,500 to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3775)|
| 1:03:04| in the construction of neighborhood retail lease spaces and improvements to an existing convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| and to provide up to $80,000 in additional EZ funding for improvements to make the project sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| and energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Mr. Pruitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3801)|
| 1:03:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Mr. Frost, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Question for Director Rojara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| And it applies for both of these because they're 11A and 11B is what I mean by both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| After we talked on the phone this afternoon and you said one property owner bought some leftover land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| from part of the TDOT land that they didn't need for the interstate improvements, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3819)|
| 1:03:46| we found out that once the work is complete, the property owners are going to have a nice new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3826)|
| 1:03:55| and they will retain ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| I looked up on KGIS and 3208 Rudy was bought March 30th of 2009 for $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3837)|
| 1:04:15| Do you think that what's being proposed is a potential in excess of $600,000 on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| I mean, is there, you know, everybody up here, including yourself, wants to have wise spending of empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| zone funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| I mean, is this reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| I am going to defer to Roger Stoudy on our team who's been working on this project and Don Peterson from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Councilman Frost, I'm not absolutely sure I understand your question, but let me describe what's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| They did purchase property from TDOT and it was part of the right-of-way between the existing parcel and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3895)|
| 1:05:04| and the interstate ramp and the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| And that was .28 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| What's being proposed is a subsidy for the overall project, which is over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| We're putting in the $500,000 that is essentially 48% of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| So, what I'm saying, 3208 Rudy was bought, like I'm saying, on April 30th of this year for $35,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| and $524,200 of empowerment zone funds plus up to $80,000 for energy sustainability will be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3932)|
| 1:05:44| I mean, it just seems like the dollars aren't working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| I mean, for the property owner to have is going to be the community is going to be getting a big benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| but it sounds like the property owner is going to be getting a real big benefit of having this spent on one parcel of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| property and on the other parcel of property in October of 2002 they paid about $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| and it's about another up to about another $600,000 of empowerment zone monies being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| I mean, you know, obviously everybody is supportive of redevelopment and improving Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| One of the things that the community told us during our public process was that they wanted economic development to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| in Lonsdale and we looked at other locations and they did just plain didn't work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| but I think we'll have a significant benefit for the community in terms of changing the overall impression as people come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| into the community off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| We're also going to create 26 new jobs for that area, many of which will be local jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| in the empowerment zone and this property is set there for quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| and it's present condition without any real activity occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| I think it's part of our role is to try and make that activity occur with the empowerment zone funds that are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| available for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| So how much of private dollars is being put into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| I have the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Actually, if you look in your council agreement, it speaks to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4036)|
| 1:07:24| For the first one, we're considering the D&D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4044)|
| 1:07:33| The developer will contribute $564,902| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| and the empowerment zone funding will be $521,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| And then the same, it's a similar ratio for the second one, for 11B, which is the developer will contribute $567,863| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4065)|
| 1:07:59| and empowerment zone funds are $524,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| So each of them, it's over a million dollar project on each of these two different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Where will the city be in terms of or will the city have priority rights concerning deeds of trust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4089)|
| 1:08:22| I'm going to defer to our lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| There's not any deeds of trust involved with the empowerment zone funding because that's the federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| So, I mean, potentially if, you know, we've had the unfortunate situation in five points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| where we had considerable funds spent and, you know, most unfortunately didn't succeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| I mean, is taxpayer's funds as well as private funds potentially at risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| The obligations that are provided for in the agreement is if they are unable to develop the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| the funds are to be paid back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| That's the recourse provided under the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| I just, Mrs. Rojero and I talked late this afternoon, and like I said, I got on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| You know, I don't live that far from here at all, so I'm, you know, familiar with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| And, you know, improvements anywhere are nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| I'm just, you know, was wondering about the commitment based on the recent sale price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4155)|
| 1:09:24| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| Mrs. Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Thank you, Mr. Doughty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| To follow up on Councilman Frost's comments and questions, actually, in each of these cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| I think you said that the developers, both with D&D and with Triple M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| the developers are investing in excess of $500,000, but in the $500,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| $160,000 plus each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| I'm sorry, say again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| $560,000 plus each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| So, but if you look at the total investment of federal empowerment zone dollars by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| it's actually a hair over $600,000 because of the sustainable and energy efficient improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| which are still capital investment into the real property, so that's part of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| It doesn't matter what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| We're investing into that real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| So, what that is doing essentially is making the city the majority investor in each of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| The developers are actually the minority investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| They're investing less than 50% of the total capital investment in the improvements in each of these pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| Now, I realize that that's not including the value of the land, the raw land itself undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| So, that may mean that they are indeed the majority investor if you include the value of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| But in terms of capital improvements, the city is taking the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| We're investing more than the private investors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Actually, it's an $80,000 total to be shared by the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| So, it's unlikely that we would actually be the majority on either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| Okay, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| It reads 80, potentially 80 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| It reads it's up to 80,000 total in the pot that the developers, the two developers together will have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4279)|
| 1:11:28| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Sorry, I didn't get into the language on the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| I'm sure you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| I was just looking at the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| So, roughly split 50-50 then in terms of capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| And again, as Rogers mentioned, this is something that the community that we've worked with a couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| several years really with the community to find investment in Lonsdale when the, you all I'm sure will remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4306)|
| 1:11:55| many years ago when the original plan was to have commercial development more in the middle of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| and there was an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| This was prior to the five points or around the same time the five points was finishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| The RFP that went out for commercial development in the middle of the neighborhood had no takers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| Basically, there was no interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| And we did a feasibility study and it was clear that for any commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| it needed to be on the edges of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| We had a couple of public meetings and the general consensus from that was that we still want commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| Where we need it would be at the high school exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| We've worked very closely with Vice Mayor Becker in the last couple of years on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| We were pleased, and I think he was quoted in a recent article about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| that we could have gone in and just tried to bring in a big outside developer to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| but we had local property owners and local business people who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| who have committed to that neighborhood, have been around that neighborhood for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| who have wanted to try and expand, in one case expand an existing business that's there and add some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| We've spent quite a bit of time working with these small business owners in this neighborhood to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| neighborhood commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| If it was something that without public sector support something would happen, it would have happened already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| We've got both of these developers have banks that have committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| They reviewed the process and they're committed to being there with them on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| So we feel it is a, yes, it's a larger investment than we would make maybe in other locations, but considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4410)|
| 1:13:40| We're in better economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| We're in better economic times, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| And so we are, you know, this is an investment that is committed to the Lonsdale neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| We are committed to making this investment in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| And certainly the city has made good investments in other parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| and in for other kinds of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| And we are working hand-in-hand with these local businesses and local folks to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| and make these small businesses work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| And we think we'll add value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| The fact that Cisco recently opened and the employees that they have there, a lot of their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| and the traffic will, you know, exit at this interstate and will go right by these establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| So it will serve the workforce locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| And as we try to expand the workforce along I-275, we'll have some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| some commercial businesses there to serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| So we think that, yes, and, you know, the whole, you all know, you've been with us for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| working on the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| The whole point of the empowerment zone is to invest dollars where the private sector doesn't invest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| And to work with local people, local businesses, the small men and women who are trying to make these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4490)|
| 1:14:58| neighborhoods work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| And we feel that it hasn't been easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| We've worked with these two different, we call them developers, but they're local folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| I mean, they're local businesses and local folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| And we've worked hard to get to a point where we could find something that would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| that they're able to invest in, and they can serve the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| I appreciate all the hard work that's gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| I think we're definitely on the right track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Ms. Poplin, going back to Councilman Frost's questions about the city's exposure here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| and options to protect the city's investment, you say the only stipulation is if nothing is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4532)|
| 1:15:40| then the city has the opportunity to recover its funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| If there's any default under the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| the recourse would be to recover the empowerments on funds that are expended up to the point of the breach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| Are we, in your opinion, do we have the same level of exposure that we had with the development at five points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4553)|
| 1:16:01| here and take the same level of risk that it could just go under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| and the city would essentially have no ability to recover any of its investment at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| The only investment that would be losing to that extent would just be the amount of the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| But those taxpayer dollars would be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| The federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Potentially, but there are means of recovery for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| Upon breach of agreement, breach of contract, there's remedies and ways to try to collect that money from the assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| But if the business simply fails, which it probably won't given what Ms. Rejero said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| it's probably a much better business model in location given Cisco, et cetera, but just wondering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4604)|
| 1:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| I would like to just stress that, first of all, these are reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| We don't just give them, you know, half a million dollars and they walk away and we wait to see if they build or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| We are following with KCDC as our agent on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| We follow them all the way through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| They submit requests for payment, the payouts, basically, as they move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| We have it structured so that the bank loan and our portion are prorated basically as we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| as long as we believe it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| So we don't put all the money in first and then something fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| They are in for the money along the way with the rest of us as we go along in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4652)|
| 1:17:40| Remember, it is taxpayer dollars and we will be investing what we will have even if the individual, in a worst case scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4660)|
| 1:17:49| if the individual business failed, we will still have development for future businesses to come in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| We will have address some blighted issues that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| You will have new buildings and a new construction and the potential for future retail to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4680)|
| 1:18:08| But, again, we've got bank partners in this that the developers have brought in that have looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| and feel confident enough with our leverage to invest in this development at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| But if the city doesn't have any lien rights and, you know, unfortunately, developments are failing daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| I mean, there's the foreclosure notice, unfortunately, for City View at Riverwalk today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| If the city doesn't, if the property is built and the worst case scenario plays out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| the bank will own the property and the improvements on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| You know, I feel better about 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| But 11B with a $35,000 land cost and up to about 60, over $500,000 in taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4730)|
| 1:19:02| I'm a little less comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4742)|
| 1:19:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| President Frost, I think it's interesting that you picked City View as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| In the case of City View, the city's investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| and therefore exposure was entirely in public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| But it was through an agreement, a development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| with the developer who has subsequently not fulfilled the entirety of that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| But we were able to protect the city's interest in that case through a dedicated letter of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| that the city has been able to fall back on or is able to fall back on, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| So there was a mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| But that is much different from this in that all the improvements are, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| I believe to be made strictly as improvements to the private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| No other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| I heard seven ayes and no noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4809)|
| 1:20:09| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| with Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| and Triple M Property Management LLC to provide empowerment zone funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| in the amount of $524,200 to assist in the construction of a neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| and retail center and to provide up to $80,000 in additional EZ funding for improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| to make the project sustainable and energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| I saw I heard six ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| 11C is a resolution approving a tax increment financing amendment to the Northside Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan to support the redevelopment of real property located at 710 East Hill Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Yeah, I think it's great that we've got this proposed investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| We realize that the city is we're looking at the city investing in the form of a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4869)|
| 1:21:18| a little over 2 million, 2.2 million roughly in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| And I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| I appreciate the fact that we have a developer slash investor that's willing to certainly in this real estate market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4885)|
| 1:21:35| invest in what should be a very high-quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| I think it's probably going to be rental rather than condo, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| That's what's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| But that's probably the only thing that can be financed right now, so that's understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| The only concern I have, and this is not this property is not within the South Waterfront redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4908)|
| 1:21:57| and does not come under the South Waterfront development regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| is embodied in the form-based code and the design guidelines, which we've, I think, we're going to have to tweak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| But we've gone to a lot of trouble to develop to make sure that the development that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| on the South Waterfront is of a consistent character and quality that we know that it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| we have confidence that it will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| A, and B, the others that want to invest there will also have that confidence that they're not going to develop something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4944)|
| 1:22:31| And or buy a piece of property anticipating development and know that what happens around them is not going to be compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| I suspect that the proposed development will be of a quality that it will be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| with what we're anticipating on the South Waterfront and what we're seeing downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| Downtown also has design guidelines with a downtown design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| This is not within the CVID, so the boundaries of the CVID, so it does not come under that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4976)|
| 1:23:05| those design guidelines and the responsibility of that design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| And what I would like to see is just as a check to make sure that it is, that what's built there is compatible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=4990)|
| 1:23:21| is a stipulation that the downtown design review board be given the same review responsibility for this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5001)|
| 1:23:31| that it has for the rest of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| And I don't expect that would be a problem at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| I expect I haven't seen the drawings and elevations on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| Nothing has been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| My understanding is that senior staff in the city has copies of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| I have not seen it as of yet, but I expect that there would be no conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| But the only thing that gives me pause is looking at what happened with City View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| City View was built under a redevelopment agreement and with a development agreement struck with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5042)|
| 1:24:12| that really addressed the public improvements in conjunction with the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| But they were, because they came in ahead of the form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| and the guidelines that were embodied in the form-based code for the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| they weren't subject to any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| And there are a lot of people, including myself, that regret that that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5069)|
| 1:24:37| We wish that they had been subject to those design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| And so, again, I'm thrilled that this investment is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| And what we're talking about here is primarily gap financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| although there will be some public improvements that will be funded in part out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| So the TIF dollars would go some to private development, part of it, and some to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| And I think that's all fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| I don't have a problem with any of that because I think it's consistent with what we've done downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| But I would like to see some opportunity for review just to make sure that we don't have happened to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5111)|
| 1:25:20| what happened with CityView.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| And I will remind council, or I assume council knows that the original developer that struck the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5122)|
| 1:25:30| the development agreement with the city for CityView was Camden Management out of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| And we thought that's who we were dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| And then Camden brought in a lead development partner called Focus Development, also out of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5140)|
| 1:25:48| Focus ran the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| And I need to be careful what I say here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| We did not get what we expected, both in terms of the development product itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| and in terms of the development partner, if you will, that the city had to work with in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| And so my point in all that is to say that I am excited about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| but I would like to see a stipulation that requires some level of review before the TIF funds are released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5175)|
| 1:26:24| It could be as simple as one meeting of the Downtown Design Review Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| but I'd like to see something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| I'm not going to make a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| I'd just like to hear what council members say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| Councilman Hawkworth, I'm just going to cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| I understand your concerns, and I have been made aware of those concerns from some other constituents of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| And I believe, if I understand correctly, I'm very excited about the fact that this north section of the riverfront is going to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5208)|
| 1:27:00| And I have a lot of confidence in those involved in this venture, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| And I believe the adjacent property owner is also somewhat involved in this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| and I'm sure he wants to protect his property value there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| And I have every confidence it's going to turn out well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| But I think what you're wanting to do is to have a condition that it be reviewed by the Downtown Design Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5239)|
| 1:27:31| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| I think if that's what we want to do, and I believe, if I understand correctly, Mr. Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| I think that has been agreed to this evening in a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| On a review by the Downtown Review Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| That the developers are willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| That's not quite correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| Let me just jump in here twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| Well, three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| One, I'm not sure that the Downtown Design Review Board has the authority to review this at all because they design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| there's boundaries for that, that they have authorities and they have guidelines that they rule on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| We do think we have, after Councilman Holquist and I talked this afternoon, I talked with Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| we talked some more about this and thought we had a legitimate point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| So maybe Dr. Lyons could talk for a moment about how we think we can handle this without going through Downtown Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| Mr. Holquist, we do appreciate the point that you raised, but I think the better way to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| and we discussed it with Mr. Bush and Mr. White here prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| is that in the development agreement that the developers will sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| and it's with KCDC subsequent to purchasing the property that they agree that the plans be approved by city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5312)|
| 1:28:40| and KCDC staff that they build according to what they propose to build, which is what the concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| And we do have the sketches and drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| We want to look at them, but both the height of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| and the fit of the buildings are very consistent with what would appear on either side of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| So that would give us a review built in the development agreement, which is the way to bind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| That's the way we usually bind projects rather than, it's really not possible to bind it through the TIF itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| but through the associated development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| And Mr. White is willing to come speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| but they're willing to adopt, to adapt the KCDC agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| and agree to require city review that they build what's consistent with what the plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| If I understand you say that senior staff within the city administration would have to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| Final design, what's actually going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| Is there a way to engage on a consultative basis design professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5380)|
| 1:29:47| or those that are perhaps members of the design review board that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| that bring those professional capabilities to that board or someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| I'm looking for making sure that we have good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5397)|
| 1:30:05| not to say that the senior staff doesn't have those capabilities, but you're not an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5405)|
| 1:30:13| Don't pretend to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| And neither am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| But that's why I like to lean on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| You know, people I see, just as an example, I'm not going to pick him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| There's somebody that ought to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| But we've got a very accomplished architect in the audience, Glenn Richters from Benefield Richters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| There's a lot of people like that here in this town that can contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| Let me respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| They have made a proposal and submitted drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| And I think the question I got from a couple of calls today was how do we assure that they build what they've proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| That we're willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| I don't know that they would be, and I don't know that I feel comfortable saying that in subsequent to this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| that third-party architects would have to, without a significant standard, anything there, any basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| We have no design guidelines that apply there, bring a subjective judgment into whether these are, quote, unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| quality plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| I think basically, and I would, all we would be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| and I would bring in professionals to do this was assure that when they submit plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| those plans are consistent with what they proposed in their detailed sketches that they have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| which I know they'll be willing to share with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| And I'd certainly like to see those sketches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| But I haven't had an opportunity to see them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| And perhaps that's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| This is a great investment, 24-plus million dollars, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| But we're hoping for hundreds of millions of dollars across an investment across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| And so, hopefully, we'd see some level of compatibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| not necessarily that they would look exactly alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| Because things that are built across the river are going to be of a variety of designs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| But within the guidelines that have been laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| And so, that's my main concern is that it reflects what we're hoping to see happen across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5519)|
| 1:32:07| Because there's a tremendous amount of investment that we're anticipating as the economy recovers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| and over the years on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| And I'm fairly confident that that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| But I'd like to have someone in there, someone in the process say, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| that really is going to be reflective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| Now, Dave Hill is not an architect, but Dave Hill is so immersed in the South Waterfront Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5547)|
| 1:32:34| that I would hope that he would be a part of that review, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| But I would also hope that there is some way to review other than to say, build what you said you're going to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5557)|
| 1:32:47| to go one step beyond that and ask the question of not necessarily the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| but ask the question of perhaps some people who have those design awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| and design skills and understand what we're trying to accomplish on the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| Is this compatible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| And if they say no, it doesn't mean senior staff wouldn't say, well, we disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| But I think it would be helpful to get that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| Mr. Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| We've been tap dancing around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| But Jim Bush is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| I'd like to ask him a couple of questions considering he's the developer or one of the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5602)|
| 1:33:29| Mr. Bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| Mr. Bush, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| If you could give us your name and address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Jim Bush at 6208 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Now, you were one of the developers involved in the condominiums, loosely speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| near Volunteer Landing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| You were one of the developers with the proposed complex, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| I am working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| My involvement goes back to the start of Volunteer Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| I was a part of the development package with Volunteer Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| and have been working continuously to complete the Volunteer Landing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| This is the last parcel to be developed, and we've worked diligently to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5650)|
| 1:34:17| Not a very nice piece of property to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| A really good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| It's been used as a dump, and we have to manage through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| And we've been working on it quite a while to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| It's really important that we don't delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| We do have a plan to work from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| And Mr. White with Core Development, who has put together this plan, will proceed according to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5681)|
| 1:34:51| A part of the agreement is prior to his purchase of the property and working through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5691)|
| 1:35:00| the plans have to be approved in that they do match the development we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| I brought a few copies of what we're planning in conversion to those of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| It will be complementary to the condominiums that are presently there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| They will be of the same quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| I didn't bring enough copies for everyone, but maybe you can share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| I brought six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| There's seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| We'll be glad to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Ms. Pilo, is that an old letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| There might be five there, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Well, I was, I may be cutting off debate, but I was prepared to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| I think there's actually a motion already on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| Council's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| There's a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| It's been so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| The pictures are being passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Maybe I'll wait just a second until some more folks get a chance to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| I'm ready to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| This is either for Mr. I don't know, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| Mr. Hill is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| Mr. Donaldson or perhaps Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| I understand and am somewhat sympathetic to Councilman Holquist's concerns about the proposal of, you know, guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5766)|
| 1:36:17| However, what is the approximate time frame we are talking about to get those guidelines created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5777)|
| 1:36:26| get them heard and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| I mean, this is a multi-month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Now, which guidelines are these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Well, if he was wanting to do something along the lines of the South Knoxville Waterfront guidelines over on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5793)|
| 1:36:41| north waterfront piece of property, there would be a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| How many months approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| For us to develop a separate set of guidelines would be quite a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| We'd probably be in the next year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| I think the idea that he brings it to the downtown design review board and use those guidelines would be the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| But we don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Those guidelines don't deal with this particular type of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| Even though it's C2, it's not within the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| So it's not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Ms. Pelow called the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Was there a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| I'd like to hear what Mr. Holquist said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| I'm prepared to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| Well, I'm pretty confident that what's going to be built is going to be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5844)|
| 1:37:34| Knowing Mr. Bush and what he's done in the past, I don't think we have the level of exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| and uncertainty that we had with City View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Of course, we didn't quite know that when we went in, but we were dealing with an unknown party we'd never dealt with before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| So I don't think we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| I think I've stated my concerns, and I want to see the project happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| I want to see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| And I think it's going to happen in the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| I hope that the concerns that I have articulated will, that everyone will keep those in mind as we go through and review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5885)|
| 1:38:15| And I hope that Mr. Hill will be involved in the review process, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| But what I would like to say is I'd like to see us move beyond being put in this kind of position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5901)|
| 1:38:31| And I know there's been some conversation within the administration, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| about how do we handle waterfront development on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| And I know the mayor's thought about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| Mr. Hill's thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I hope that as council we will encourage a comprehensive look at north waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| And what I would like to see is not just have a south waterfront development department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5931)|
| 1:38:58| excuse me, can't talk, south waterfront development department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| but move from that to a waterfront development department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| And because I think it's very difficult to say, well, we're only going to deal with one side of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| and then somebody else is going to deal with the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| and we're not going to worry too much about how they relate to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| So I think that's up to the administration as to how they structure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| But I would hope that this council would be supportive of anything along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| And with that, I think I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| No other comments then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=5969)|

| 1:43:09| It's a nine-mile section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| And just last month, the Third Creek Bike Trail averaged 350 individuals a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| and the James White Greenway along the river was averaging over 250 individuals a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| So it's by far our busiest greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| We're hoping to take advantage of this new greenway ranger program to allow this individual to be our ambassador| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| on the greenways and help deal with maintenance issues as well as dealing with the users of the greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| and the neighbors of the greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| And if you don't mind, I'd like to ask Carol Evans if she would step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| and tell a little bit more about the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| and recognize some of the individuals who have made this become a reality through their partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6220)|
| 1:43:50| Carol Evans, 3505 Kesterwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| With Legacy Parks Foundation, I just want to say we're really very pleased to be working with David Brayson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| and Joe Walsh on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| This is a pilot program that Legacy Parks is supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| So there's two prongs to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| One is we raised the funds to fund the half-time AmeriCorps position who will become the greenway ranger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| And the project really came out of a volunteer who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| I'd really like to enhance the experience on that greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| So one of that is putting a person out there who can be an ambassador| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| or help with maintenance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| The second prong of that is, and actually Glenn Richters is here at the track club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| and Glenn is really instrumental in getting that $10,000 to fund that vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| The second part of that is we're going to take on fundraising for beautification along that greenway all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| from the downtown all the way to Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| So what you'll hopefully see over the next coming months is involving corporate businesses along that greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| individuals and groups to adopt that park, working in junction with Joe's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| and we'll raise those funds through Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| What we hope is this can be a pilot program that we can help extend in cooperation with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| to the other greenways throughout the city and really get a lot of eyes on the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| and really enhance that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| So we really appreciate the ability to work so closely with the parks department on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| Mr. Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Ms. Carol Evans or Joe Walsh, either one, I just have a couple of questions about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| You can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| I've gotten in the habit recently of riding my bicycle from island home to Bearden to the New Earth Fair store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| and shopping, and it's been a wonderful experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| It's a little challenging at times riding through mud on the section of the Third Creek Greenway close to West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6335)|
| 1:45:44| and several sections through there where a lot of mud washes across the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| And when it's real dry, you're just kicking up dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| When it's wet and if you don't have fenders on your bike, you're slinging mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| And then this past Saturday, actually, the section I believe is going to be maintained by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| I believe that's part of the agreement for this new development on Hill Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| They hit a rock and got a flat tire where rock had washed into the greenway from that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| And so, you know, some personal experience that says I'd love to see better maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| The question is, will these rangers be carrying brooms and shovels, and will they do any cleanup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| And, of course, some of that's pretty substantial cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| But I'm just wondering what this is going to do for those of us that use it and would like to see better maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| I'll speak to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| I know Carol and I are both users as well, and I share some of your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| But, yes, this greenway ranger, he'll be driving his gator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| and it will be well-equipped with maintenance equipment to deal with small issues like gravel and mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| But also, he'll be a facilitator to make sure that the work order gets turned in in a timely fashion to the service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| who then will do more of the larger projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| So this individual is going to wear many hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| He'll be an ambassador.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| He'll be dealing with individuals, but also dealing with hands-on maintenance issues because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| this is by far our busiest greenway, and some of those issues need to be addressed fairly quickly after a heavy rain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| and you get that wash off onto the surface, which causes some safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| And, of course, they won't be carrying a gun now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Can I just say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| This other gentleman must be from the Knoxville Track Club, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| I just think this would be a great opportunity to thank the Track Club for the efforts that they put forth to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6457)|
| 1:47:45| in so many city events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| And the West Hills Community Association sponsors the gazebo run every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| And it's a good time to thank you because we could not do that without the Track Club's assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| And we raised $4,000, which will go to the Greater Tennis Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| and the city of Knoxville to start to defray the second phase of the tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6485)|
| 1:48:12| So, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| I don't know if your folks know how much they are appreciated across the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| and how far-reaching their efforts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| So, now you're helping with the greenways, which is just terrific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| and helping us to raise some funds to further the tennis court expansion there in West Hills Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| And I'll return that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| I think the last time I thanked the mayor, he was not quite as well rested as he is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| But we appreciate very much all the support that we have in putting on the marathon, the covenant marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6521)|
| 1:48:49| Without your cooperation and your help, that wouldn't be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| And it's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| 11K is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the Helen Ross McNabb Center, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| to provide $200,000 in funding from State of Tennessee House Program Income for the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| and operation of permanent supportive housing at 1010 and 1020 Cox Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| I was going to make the motion with a statement first, but that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| I had the opportunity to go out and look at this project on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| And I was extremely pleased with the apartments, the way they arranged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| And I certainly was mesmerized by the trees surrounding this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| So, I do want to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| Please take the name off that motion and add Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| Mr. Councilman Hawkins, real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| I agree with Councilman Booker completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| And I would go on to say that I think, Council, this is an example of how permanent supportive housing should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6588)|
| 1:49:56| I talked with Mr. Smeltzer at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| He's here tonight about this project a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| Sixteen units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| They have a full-time manager who has a degree in psychology, is already a staff member of the Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6604)|
| 1:50:13| and is experienced in working in these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| He's going to be an on-site live-in manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| In addition to that, they're going to have a full-time caseworker there during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| My understanding is every day or at least every weekday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| And that's for 16 units, meaning 16 clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| And I think that's the example of how to do permanent supportive housing as opposed to doing it perhaps some other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6630)|
| 1:50:38| And I'll leave it at that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| But I want to flag that for Council as an example of how it can be done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6640)|
| 1:50:51| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6652)|

| 1:51:35| Mr. Mayor, Donna Buckman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| I don't know if she wants to speak to it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| I can almost guarantee you this is why she's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| She said she's fine, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| A lot of good work went into the complete streets program through TPO and the Gresham and Smith's consulting work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6706)|
| 1:51:53| that happened around that, both for Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| And, of course, there was a, because it was TPO, they had to look at another area within the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| So they also did Washington Avenue or Washington Pike and Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| But great work and great conceptual framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| And I hope council will support this as a conceptual, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| framework or guidelines for moving forward on the street redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| 12A is an ordinance setting a certified tax rate as required by TCA and amending ordinance 08509 to adjust the tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| from 281 to 246.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| I want to, what you just voted on is a result of a lot of work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| We're about to pass over something that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| This is the lowest tax rate in at least the last 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| We don't have recorded history before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| And that is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| So, along the way, this council, some of you for almost eight years and some of us for six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| have made lots of hard calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| And that result is, like I said, the lowest tax rate in recorded history for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| So, thank you and good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| That should be a good headline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| Is anybody listening here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| 12B is an ordinance to close the portion of Ramsey Street from Western Avenue to Blackstock Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| subject to conditions and authorizing the mayor to issue quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| Gary Mitchell, applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| I heard from, I mean, there's a number of letters in the packet concerning opposition from different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| about this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| I heard from a nearby property owner at A.G. Hines Company expressing concern over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6820)|
| 1:53:52| Did anybody else hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| Any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| Just, you know, we've got the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| It's totally discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| And, you know, considering I'm hearing from nearby property owners, a large property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| I'm not sure that I can support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| And we have, you know, there's the letter from T. issues concerning T. issues concerning engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6855)|
| 1:54:24| I'm not sure this is the best idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| Mr. Hoffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| Just to follow up on Councilman Frost's comments, I also heard from A.G. Hines Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| And I also have noted that there are a variety of concerns about this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6877)|
| 1:54:44| And I'm not sure that I've heard any clear rationale or argument in favor of the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6884)|
| 1:54:53| So I'm reluctant to support it without further information or rationale also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6893)|
| 1:55:03| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| The only objection I heard came from somebody in the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| And they called back and withdrew the objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| Mr. Haslund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| Mr. Campbell may be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Would you like to speak to this, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| I didn't sign up because I didn't realize there were any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| And you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| We had a couple issues with the fire department wanting some things striped a specific way to make sure they had access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6927)|
| 1:55:34| to a hydrant in a part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| There was also an issue with a turnaround that was needed in front of the building that was worked out a couple weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6937)|
| 1:55:45| I believe, with city engineering and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| And as far as the A.G. Hines, I have not heard anything from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| The reason we're doing this is because the Valerian, and I have Mr. Mitchell behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6954)|
| 1:56:02| there's a parking lot adjacent to this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| They have several outdoor events, which requires that they close the street from time to time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| It also provides them the handicapped parking accessibility that they need to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| because they have that in the parking area across the street from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| Without this road closure, you'd have people that would walk across a city street, potentially a handicapped area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6983)|
| 1:56:30| and there's no other good parking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| So those are the two primary reasons that we're asking for this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| We're not taking the road out of service, per se, because as far as deliveries and those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=6997)|
| 1:56:45| and as well as with the fire equipment that may or may not need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| But it's not like we're going in and digging the road up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| putting the fence down in the middle or anything because it's still needed for traversing back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| And, again, for deliveries, as it were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| You're saying that it will continue to function as a private street, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| A driveway, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| A driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Mr. King, we've got a letter from Floyd Smith in city engineering saying they cannot support the closing of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| right-of-way and gets into issues with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| What's changed since Mr. Smith wrote that letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| Actually, you have two letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| That's part of the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| There was a letter dated June the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| And Mr. Campbell referred to a letter a few weeks ago which dated July 6th, if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7061)|
| 1:57:48| The engineering department recommends approval based on the three conditions in Mr. Smith's letter on the July 6th memo to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7068)|
| 1:57:58| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| I heard a hall, Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| Any other nos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| And Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| I actually didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| I think we have to have five for it to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| Fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| I can only vote in these cases in a tie vote, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| So, unfortunately, the way that we're missing two council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| and you have to have five affirmative votes, and two folks can't be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| and there's only four affirmative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| So even though it passed in numbers four to three, it doesn't pass by our bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| You have to have five affirmative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| So this does not come back for a second reading of any kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| If it fails on the first reading, no, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| It has to pass on the first reading to come back the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| Can I address them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Go ahead if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Gary Mitchell, 110 Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Mr. Hall, Mr. Holquist, and Mr. Frost, I'm not aware of anything that the neighbor that you said had an issue with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7151)|
| 1:59:21| A.G. Hines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| I can't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| I mean, it has no effect on their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| And Mr. Hines would have called us if we bought all of our products from there, our building materials and everything from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| And the straight is actually unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| When you make that corner, tractor-trailers hit our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| There's almost a dead-end turn around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| And the thing is, is when we do events in the parking lot, my insurance, our licensing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| and everything will carry over to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| So it will just be an additional expense that we won't have to incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| But it doesn't, what we're trying to do has no effect on their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| And they're not, I can't, I've never heard from them about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| I didn't know they had any issues with it whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| So I would ask you please to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| And if you have any questions for me, I'll certainly address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| But I've never heard from Mr. Hines about why they would have any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7205)|
| 2:00:10| And like I said, it just allows us to carry our insurance and everything because that's our parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| and we own the entire block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| And that little street, which is not used, it's basically impassable for trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7217)|
| 2:00:23| It's just what separates us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| And so now our insurance, license, and everything can carry on into our parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| And that's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| I'm surprised there wouldn't be any questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| And Mr. Woodhull has seen the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| I think, by our rules, it has to be brought back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| It would have to, you'd have to have a motion reconsidered by one of the people who voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| So at this meeting it would only take five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| At the next meeting it would take six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| So hearing nothing, we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| 12C is an ordinance adopting the Magnolia Avenue Corridor Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| and amendments to the Central City and East City Sector Plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson a couple of questions about this that I asked him before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| I just want to get it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| Buildings that are non-conforming would be brought into this with a non-conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7288)|
| 2:01:36| a legal non-conforming status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| Did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| Keep in mind that this is merely a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| And the plan makes some recommendations as far as future zoning along the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| some of which may be a form-based type of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| In the event that the zoning is changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| any existing building would have legal non-conforming status that would continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| until the property was redeveloped, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| In the event that we do adopt a more form-based-like code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| it's likely that the land uses would become less important so that a property owner could, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7334)|
| 2:02:21| change land uses within an existing building and be compliant with the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| and not have to come back for future rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| In the event that we did proceed with creating a zone district to fit these various sub-areas along the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7353)|
| 2:02:42| it would be after a period of study and public meetings, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| very comparable to the Cumberland Avenue corridor where almost two years ago now we adopted the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7367)|
| 2:02:55| and we are still working on the zone district to implement that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| It's just the first in many steps before we have to deal with legal non-conforming issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7381)|
| 2:03:08| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| Council, you'll note in the packet, if you page about a fourth page back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7391)|
| 2:03:20| there's an interdepartmental memorandum from Brent Johnson, a series of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| It's actually from I sat down subsequently and talked to Mr. Johnson about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| and he gave me a list of folks within the engineering department who had contributed to these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| Mr. King, it's my understanding that Mr. Johnson, this is what's in the packet because that's what was submitted to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| But, in fact, Mr. Johnson has revised that memorandum since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| I have not seen a copy, but I've been told that his memorandum was revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| and some of these concerns are no longer in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7435)|
| 2:04:03| I don't think the memo was revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| I think there have been some discussions with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| I guess I misunderstood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| Well, I know when I sat down and talked through Mr. Johnson, like number one, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| I don't think that is necessarily an engineering concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| I think that's an opinion, and he agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| And some of them are clearly engineering concerns and would, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| be addressed in a subsequent effort to rezone the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7467)|
| 2:04:32| I just wanted to follow up on Mr. Donaldson's comments and say that my understanding is this is very much a dynamic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7472)|
| 2:04:41| And, of course, if form-based code were developed, there would be an extensive public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| and then it would come to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| So enough said about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| Any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| I think Mr. Hall, I'll wait until this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090811?start=7503)|
