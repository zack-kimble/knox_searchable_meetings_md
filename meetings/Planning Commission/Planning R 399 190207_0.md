| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Okay, it's 9 o'clock, so I think we'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| I just want to actually make a couple of announcements at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| So go ahead and call this meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| And the first agenda item is approval of the January 3rd meeting minutes, which you all should have in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=46)|
| 0:00:53| I hope you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| If not, it's up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| Anybody have any corrections, additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| Make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Yeah, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| Okay, we only have one application before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| And the applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| So this is 3121 Johnston Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| You also should have that in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| It doesn't look like anybody's here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| I'm going to open the floor to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| It is a new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| Knoxville Habitat for Humanity is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| Let's go down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| I did have one question, Bill, because I know you've developed several in this vicinity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| Is this roof pitch, I know we've gone back and forth between the six and the eight, but is this roof pitch the same as what's been built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=118)|
| 0:02:06| Is it next door or maybe a couple doors down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| Is it the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| I wasn't sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| I turned this in so long ago, which was probably only three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| I believe it's the same as the two or three we built towards High School Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| Bear with me for a minute while I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=143)|
| 0:02:33| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| Same side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=159)|
| 0:02:51| So this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| Are these the ones you're referring to, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Yes, we built the second and the third one down, and I believe they're all 512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=178)|
| 0:03:07| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| That looks like the proposal for that one, 3129.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| I did go back in the minutes and it's 612 roof pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Oh, it's a 612?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Okay, so this is pretty identical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| I mean, very similar, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| I'm sorry, what does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| It says 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| I just wanted to make sure we weren't doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| Okay, so it is steeper than our normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| It's a 612.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| I guess, first of all, we turned in a ranch on the entire lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| and then it was told probably better off using the 50-foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| so we're subdividing it into two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| It's not really 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| It's a little bit less than 100, but it's close to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| So we'll build another one eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| Can we see the door on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| This one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Yeah, just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Maybe your intent is to do one sort of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| You can see it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| It's the same style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| It has a window, a small window on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| It just has a screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Yeah, I mean, it looks like this proposed house is identical to that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Yeah, except for the windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| The windows, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| It looks like you've got prairie windows on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Is there a reason why you went with the three windows on the front of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| house instead of four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| It just kind of creates a big gap in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| I didn't like it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| I can change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| There's a closet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| It's a bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| We're going to put a window in a closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| I could probably move the closet, though, if you don't want me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| and put another window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| I think it would create some symmetry to have that fourth window so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| matches this house, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| I've got to give you all something to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=300)|
| 0:05:10| The house is kind of wide, so the way that those porch works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| it would be hard to make those windows closer together so you could make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| work without moving the closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| It would probably be easier to move the closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| And, Bill, it's up on the screen, too, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| Yeah, we can make it symmetrical in the front and add another window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| Would you be able to do the same door that you did on Springdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| or was that one more expensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| I'll have to get the pictures out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Is it not the same as this one, or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| What was that, Kay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| I was wondering if you could do the same door you did on Springdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| I don't remember what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| I think it's attempting maybe to be Krasman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| but the proportions aren't right on the drawing or on that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| But if you can do the one we did on Springdale, that one is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| We would be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=387)|
| 0:06:39| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| The parking, did we get any comments from the engineering staff you talked to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=408)|
| 0:06:57| We don't have any problem with the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| Will you wind up needing any kind of attic vent at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| I mean, in the front or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Functionally, maybe you don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| We can add one if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| Kay, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| I didn't hear the question that you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| I was wondering about an attic vent on the front if it's needed functionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| There is one showing on this house across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| I think that would be appropriate if you could add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| We will add a vent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| I think that might be something that maybe is not within the purview of infill housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| but if you would want to voluntarily add it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=463)|
| 0:07:53| I need my mouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| It's hard to control with that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Coming down the wrong side now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Does anybody want to see the vent on the house across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| He does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Well, I meant for everybody to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| It's a small square vent, the one down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=498)|
| 0:08:35| So that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Can you all see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=518)|
| 0:09:00| I think this looks like you're showing the guardrail on the porch being 36 inches high, which is code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| It doesn't need to be any taller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=548)|
| 0:09:23| I guess as part of this application, we're also approving the flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Do you plan on platting this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Platting do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| You're platting the property, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Yeah, the surveyor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| I'm not sure if we're needing to look at the flat today or if that comes in as a separate application later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=577)|
| 0:09:49| This is more of a, I guess it has all the certificates on it, so I guess it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| It looks like it could be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Yeah, or submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| If we're going to be approving the lots, we just need to make sure we're doing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| Splitting it 50-50 like it is seems appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| It seemed like that was the lot style anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| The setbacks, it looks like you're pretty much sticking with the setbacks of the R18 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=613)|
| 0:10:24| You're pretty close to it anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| You've got about nine feet, almost ten feet on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=630)|
| 0:10:39| That would be okay with doing side setbacks for both lots at a seven-foot minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=639)|
| 0:10:48| and then no less than 15 feet combined or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| You can't do 20 feet but 15 feet combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| That way you've got a little bit of wiggle room with placing the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=659)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=676)|
| 0:11:26| I assume the other lot you would just be pretty similarly located in the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| the new house would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| No need to come closer to the road or anything on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| We don't even have a family for that lot yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=697)|
| 0:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=709)|
| 0:12:04| We have a list of, I guess we'll approve it, make a motion to approve contingent upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| The fourth window on the front, the door matching the Springdale house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| the vent similar to across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| Did I leave anything else out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| Is that vent across the street or just down the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Previously developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| I'll put in the house number in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| Square gable vent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| I'll make a motion to approve contingent upon those action items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Did we add the, I didn't hear a condition about the plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| I'm not sure if we have the condition as part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| I guess it's sensitive to submit it as part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| But if we can just go ahead and just state that we are approving the layout of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| That's what's being submitted right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| And I'm perfectly fine with it, but Mike made it a 15-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Yeah, I just mentioned that Mike has an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| the seven-foot side minimum and then 15-foot total between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| It's a seven-foot side, which is still a one-foot difference anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Make it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| It's good where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| The house on the plot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| It's hard to get a machine on either side if you, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Yeah, the house is fine where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Just give you a little bit of wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Yeah, that's submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| We have a surveyor set the pins too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| We don't do it, so it's exactly where it's plotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| So we don't have any conditions for the plot then, I don't think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| No, we don't need it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| Okay, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| And there's nothing else on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| so if anyone wants to make a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| I'll make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190207?start=863)|
