| 0:27:56| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've thought a lot about what I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| and I know my words will not convey my complete feelings for Wanda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| or what she meant to Knox County and me personally. From hearing the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| you can see what a great and incredible body of work her life was. An educator, an administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1695)|
| 0:28:23| and a legislator. But what it doesn't convey is the inspiration and influence she had on others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| I had the pleasure of knowing Wanda for several decades, watching her take action for causes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1711)|
| 0:28:40| seeing her analyze and research issues, talking with her about her love for this community in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1720)|

| 0:28:56| When I first pondered the idea of running for commission back in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| Wanda was one of the first people I talked to to get advice from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| And I know without a doubt that if she didn't believe in me and have confidence in me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| I would not be sitting where I am here today. She impressed and influenced me to be a bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| part of our community. She helped me to see we can all make a difference. I miss Wanda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1758)|
| 0:29:28| I miss Wanda in our conversations. She was a great leader and a wonderful woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1768)|

| 0:29:43| and he would like to say a few words also. Congressman Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you, Randy, Commissioner Smith, Mr. Chairman, and all my friends on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1788)|

| 0:30:00| into this short amount of words, but the reality was Wanda was just a dear friend. When I was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| little boy, she was with me, you know, close to me when both my folks died when I was older,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| and she's been a complete inspiration to me. She really messed up the good old boy network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| on commission. When she came to commission, she was no pushover. She knew her facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| and if she thought you were wrong, she'd let you have it. She didn't care about the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| If you've ever read a book called The Millionaire Next Door, maybe no secret to anybody, but Wanda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| was fairly wealthy. She basically did it on a school teacher's pay. I was at her house one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1837)|
| 0:30:47| at the end of the month, and it was close to election time, and I asked her, I said, I looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| at all these stacks of checks that she had, and literally, I think it was 17 or 18 checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| and I said, Wanda, all these contributions, she goes, no, it's end of the month, Timmy. All these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| people are paying the rent, and she, you wouldn't have known it, but actually, in reality, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| actually ran cattle down Middlebrook Pike, if you can believe that. Her family, her mom and dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| grew up over there, and Wanda followed in their place, and she did a whole lot with very humble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1873)|
| 0:31:22| beginnings. She worked under Lamar Alexander's administration, and she was just an incredible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| lady, but politically, she was a political dynamo. In my very first race, I remembered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1890)|

| 0:31:43| and 90s, 90s, when I first ran for the state house, they were almost unheard of, but it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| public record. She got a hold of them, and she figured out a way to put those numbers together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| and when I went door to door, just like you do now, you don't think much of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| there's services that provide that, and I remembered, I went to, when I first got elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| on the night of the election, I wasn't supposed to win, and I was driving down Winston Road in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1925)|

| 0:32:21| I want to thank you for everything, I said, but we lost, and she said, by how many? I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| lost by about 12 votes, and she, I remember these exact words, she said, Timmy, get home and get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| shower, you've won this thing, and she knew, the old saying about politics is local, she knew it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| she knew it precinct to precinct, street by street, and people would call her continuously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| when she was in office, and she took care of the details, and that was Wanda Moody to a T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| and she called me shortly, shortly before she died, and I was in D.C., and we were just talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| about old times, and it was a very, very sweet conversation, and she's called me Timmy, and she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| said, Timmy, she said, you just do what's right, and don't worry about anything else, and I take those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| words to heart, and she was a wonderful lady, and I'm sorry I've talked too long, it's a pleasure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=1989)|

| 0:37:28| longtime reserve firefighters, John Howe Cliff from the Carter community, passed away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| complications from COVID, we laid him to rest on January the 10th, and what I want the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| to know is that this virus has affected even the first responders in your county, John responded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2260)|

| 0:37:52| doing now, all in East Knox County, particularly in the Carter community, we were honored to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| known John Howe Cliff, proud that he represented us so well over the last 35 plus years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| and served the Carter community faithfully, we want to ask you to remember the Cliff family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| our fire department as we travel down this road of healing, moving forward, as I've said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| please remember that our fire stations are open to you commissioners, and you're always welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| to stop by at any time, as always we solve a lot of problems around the coffee pot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| and I'll entertain any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you, Mr. Bagwell, do we have any commissioners that have a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| our team at Rural Metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| I'm not seeing any hands up, but please accept our condolences for your loss of your team member, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2321)|
| 0:38:50| it's not getting any easier, but we appreciate their service, and all that you do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you very much, thank you, Mr. Bagwell, we'll move to item number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| and call on Dr. Martha Buchanan from our Knox County Health Department to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| discuss the 2019 community health assessment, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2345)|
| 0:39:14| I'm trying to, okay, there, that's the camera, excuse me, sorry about that, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| Yes, thank you, great, I am going to attempt to share my screen, and hopefully it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2359)|
| 0:39:35| So, first of all, commissioners, thank you so much for the opportunity to share our 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| community health assessment with you, I apologize, I'm going to call my dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| she has bad timing, this is our cornerstone publication, we produce this about every five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| years, and the data comes from several sources, and Knox County Health Department epidemiologists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2395)|
| 0:40:03| analyze the data to help paint a picture of health, or the state of health for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| We are going to have hard copies available for you, but you can also find it online at our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2410)|
| 0:40:20| So, again, I've gone through this, we do produce this report, and we do have a lot of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2420)|
| 0:40:30| we do produce this report every five years, because population health outcomes don't change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| very quickly, it takes time to see those changes, and in a shorter time frame, we just don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| those. Outside COVID-19, we don't normally produce data as frequently as we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2444)|
| 0:40:54| The process we use is a nationally recognized strategic planning model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| and it's an important pillar of our voluntary accreditation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| and releasing this report is a crucial step in raising awareness of our county's ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| health issues, while informing our path to building a healthier community, and not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| health department's path, but our community's path. You'll notice this is the 2019 report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| and we would have, the data was compiled before the COVID-19 pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| and represents pre-COVID baseline for Knox County. Because of the pandemic, we are releasing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| slightly late, and like I said, while we release COVID data in real time, due to its critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| nature, that is not our normal practice, and usually population health data at the local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| state, and national level is vetted for some time before it's released, which is what has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| happened with this data as well, that it helps ensure its reliability and accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| We believe this report shines a light on where we are as a community, where we're improving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| and where we have serious challenges, and all of this report can help, and this report helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| organizations, public policy bodies such as yourself, make decisions on the needs of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| community. An example of that is Covenant Health uses this data to inform the community-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| health interventions, which is part of a requirement from Medicare for them. So what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| new in this report from the last one we did five years ago? One of the things is focusing on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| drivers of health that you see before you. These are the large external factors, like education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| housing, and other things that influence individual health outcomes, and you'll notice that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| access to care is on there, but it's not the largest contributor. So access to care is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| of it, but it's not the largest contributor, and throughout this report, we look at issues from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| lens of the drivers of health, and what are the things contributing to making something worse or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| something better? You know, we know that the community's health is tied to our economy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| education, but the reverse is also true, that education and economy are tied to the health of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2592)|
| 0:43:20| our citizens. It's hard to learn if you're not healthy when you're in school, and you need an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| income to be able to support healthy behaviors. Understanding these larger factors, we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| is very important for us as a community to understand how we can impact health. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2614)|
| 0:43:43| it's not just about access to care. There's so many other things that contribute to the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| of our community. So what happens next? Like I said, you'll have paper copies will be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| available. The Community Health Council will take this report, identify three or four health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| that they believe are important for Knox County to address, and also define measurable objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2640)|
| 0:44:08| under each priority issue and release what's called a Community Health Improvement Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| which anyone in our community can use to impact health of their employers or of their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| or you all might use to develop health policy for the county. They'll partner with existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| organizations to implement new action plans. One of our action plans last time we did this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2667)|
| 0:44:37| around addressing substance misuse, and what came out of that was our Together Healthy, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2677)|
| 0:44:45| sorry, All for Knox effort, which is about addressing substance misuse. And actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| that action plan is in its implementation phase, so we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| And after this report is created, the Community Health Improvement Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Health Council will come back and provide it for you and other elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| And I know that was really quick, but I'm happy to entertain questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan. Are there any questions? Maybe you could stop sharing your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| screen so we get back to our grid. No problem. There are questions for Dr. Buchanan from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| commissioners. I have one if nobody else wants to start. I'm not seeing any hands, so I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2723)|
| 0:45:34| First off, great work, and thank you for providing this. I thought it was fascinating. I've been sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| of picking through it a little bit here and there, and the data is really amazing. But also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| looking back at how we've done and things we've improved on, I thought it was a really excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| report. One of my questions is, obviously, this is a five-year snapshot in time, so given that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| this is through 2019 and 2020 is our pandemic year, one of the questions is, I kind of don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2756)|
| 0:46:07| want to wait five more years to sort of look at this year or two years snapshot because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| so much that we have talked about and learned about COVID, about flu season, about infectious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| disease, about other health behaviors, any number of things that might be affected by how we travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| how we live, how we quarantine, whatever the case might be. Is there any plans to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2784)|
| 0:46:32| sort of a two-year snapshot specifically looking at COVID impacts on the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| or will it truly need to just be rolled up into sort of this bigger, broader sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| you know, five years from now, and how did we do? So that's a great question, and we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| actually had that conversation yet, but I think I would say kind of a two-part answer for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| I think the lessons learned from COVID need to be shared and implemented way before five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2813)|
| 0:47:01| definitely, and we've learned some things from COVID. Our communities learned things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| our healthcare providers have learned things, and we certainly in public health have learned things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| and those things seem to be taken and used and not ignored. I think our next big assessment will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| in five years, but do we do an interim assessment? That's a great question for me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| talk to my epidemiologists about. What I will say is when you look through this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| you'll notice that mental health and substance misuse were problems for our community before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| COVID. We know that COVID has contributed to some worsening of some of those conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| and I think it'll be interesting in some extent to see, you know, the impact of 2020 on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2862)|
| 0:47:50| other four years of data, because we'll roll it all up into that and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| does 2020 really make those issues move up or down in severity for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| or is it just a blip in time connected to the pandemic that is significant and worth noticing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| but will it impact the overall data? So I'm happy to take that question back to my staff and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| what we can do in the interim to get some information back to y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| That'd be great. One last point, and then I'll turn it over to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| I was impressed. I'm just looking at page 63, but I was impressed throughout the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| report of how there are several points where they say here are the resources currently available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| If this is the issue, 63 is about mental health, and it'll identify who's actually working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| in the community. So much of what we do as commissioners is sort of information traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| cop where we're trying to help connect people with resources or explain who does what in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| community, and I was impressed with every step of the way it says here are the groups that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| in the community. Most of these are non-profit organizations that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| focused on these particular issues, and so I thought that was a nice addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| Thank you. Our goal is for this to really be a resource for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| in that way, finding resources, but also for our non-profit organizations to use the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| to get funding for the issues of concern. Other commissioners, do you have any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2957)|

| 0:49:43| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan. We're going to move on to the item F on our agenda. This is public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2983)|
| 0:49:54| and I have our list today. We're going to start our public forum with your criminal court clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=2994)|
| 0:50:03| Mike Hammond. He's going to talk about the sheriff's added item, number 303,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| and then just in the on-deck circle, we will begin with public comment from Janet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| Brady Watson, Allie Cohn, Sherry Garrett, Ann Strange, Gene Burr, and then I'll kind of recap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| the list here in a minute. So I'll first call on criminal court clerk, Mr. Mike Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| to join us and turn his camera on so we can see him, if he is still with us. I see his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| and I see his face. Mr. Hammond, thank you for joining us in Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| Sure. Thank you so much, commissioners. As Chairman Jay mentioned, I'm here to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| you about an item that Tom Spangler is going to have before you in just a little while. I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| to say that the pandemic, of course, has forced all of us to rethink the way that we do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| For example, right now, you ladies and gentlemen are conducting county's business via Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| and so we in the court system have also had to rethink doing our business. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| the state Supreme Court has ordered, and I'd like to read from the order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| says courts should continue to conduct as much business as possible by means other than in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| court proceedings. Courts are encouraged to continue and even increase the use of telephone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3075)|

| 0:51:26| All these message methods should be the preferred option over in-person court proceedings. It goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| on to say judges are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| judges are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that core constitutional functions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3096)|

| 0:51:47| continue. I'd like to say that I believe that we in the court system have done that. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| stepped up to make sure that the courts have functioned. My office has been open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| every workday with special COVID protocols, and because of the rule limiting in-person proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| our clerks in criminal and criminal sessions have reset over 18,000 cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| But as I mentioned, the judges are charged with ensuring core constitutional functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| and rights are being protected, and this includes those who are incarcerated. For several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3135)|

| 0:52:35| keep people as safe as possible. We've already installed remote equipment here in most of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| courtrooms in the city county building. We use this through a special technology fund that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| and this equipment is going to serve us for years. But I wanted to give you some specific numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| In October, excuse me, November, December, and January, in our criminal court division with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| three criminal court judges, we have already had 1,500 video cases. Now, if I were to go all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3177)|
| 0:53:05| way back to March, that figure would be much greater. That's only like a three-month snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| In criminal sessions with our five judges, they have been holding in-person hearings with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| we call the jail cases. They have been bringing the prisoners over from jail to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| their constitutional rights were being upheld. The criminal judges did not start video conferencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| until the latter part of December, and also here in January, mainly because of space requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| But in that time, in October, November, and December, we had in this building between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| 4,000 and 5,000 cases. Now, I say cases because an individual may have more than one case, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| can imagine that we're talking about hundreds of individuals who have come into this building to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| have their hearing heard in sessions. Since we have started the video conferencing, we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| over 1,000 cases just in our sessions courts. So, while the price tag I'm not real sure about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3238)|
| 0:54:08| I would like you to consider this. Our deputies have to get these prisoners up if they come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| this building. They've got to feed them, transport them to and from the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| They've got to have adequate security during that transport, as well as here in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| So, lowering the numbers that have to come into this building is obviously going to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| And so, I wanted to give you an idea of the magnitude of what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| so that as you consider this, I would like to be on record as saying that this is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| of the magnitude of it or the scope of it. I'll let Sheriff Spangler talk about, but I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| just give you an idea so that as you are considering your decisions, that you know the magnitude of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| we're looking at. It is substantial. And I want to emphasize, I think our clerks and our people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| the court system have done a good job, but we have a long way to go. But thank you. I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3292)|

| 1:01:33| for COVID cases. And the county Board of Health is made up of a number of medical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| with a wealth of experience in their respective fields. These board members are not politicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| and they do not have agendas. Their task is to look at the data and recommend actions to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| control the spread of COVID under the special circumstances in a state of emergency declared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3710)|

| 1:02:03| mayor, and I fully support the medical professionals on the Board of Health and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| Chair Dr. Martha Buchanan. The actions they have suggested to this point are completely reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| and backed by science. For example, we know that masks stop the spread of the virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| which has been borne out by countless studies and a wealth of data backing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| We also know that places where people are inside in close proximity and in situations where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| might not be masked can also lead to increased spread of the virus. So the board has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| recommendations to encourage mask wearing and limit situations which may lead to increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| transmission of the virus. You know, it's not hard to wear a mask, though it may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| uncomfortable at times, and I think we should all be willing to wear one to protect our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| This really is an attempt by the board to encroach on our constitutional rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| This is an attempt to save lives. And to commissioners who might be questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| the constitutionality of the board, I just ask you to consider what dissolving this board would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| and if it's really, you know, a good idea to put these powers in the hands of one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| even someone as capable as Dr. Buchanan, we're leaving them in the hands of several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| I know Dr. Buchanan is more than capable, but if your concern is over a concentration of power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| this seems to do the exact opposite of what you intend. I know that folks may not be as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| concerned about the virus, but I know there are many Knox County residents who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| and fortunately we have lost almost 500 of our fellow Knox County residents to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| and unfortunately there will likely be many more before we get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| So commissioners, I would just urge you this evening to vote against this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| leaving the Board of Health able to respond to new developments with the virus and issue guidance as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| they see fit to help slow its spread. They know best how to respond to this better than any of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| and they should remain the ones in charge of leading the fight against this virus. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| so much. Thank you, Mr. Watson. Next up on our public forum, I'll go down the list here to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3838)|

| 1:04:44| drafted, the total number of Knox Countyans who had died from COVID-19 was 306. 124 of those deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| had occurred in the month of December. A typical flu season in Knox County killed around 120| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| residents for the entire year. As of January 20th, the death toll was 409 deaths, more than 123 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| Let's look back a bit. On September 28th, we were well into the pandemic. By this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| we knew that the disease was highly infectious. 2.8% of those who had tested positive had died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| We had good science indicating that the disease spread through person-to-person contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| and we had plenty of evidence indicating that masks and social distancing were among the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| ways to fight it. On that day, coronavirus had killed 83 people in Knox County. Rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3926)|

| 1:05:38| spread of the virus, the county government allowed unmasked individuals into the city-county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| to recite baseless and foolish conspiracy theories. In addition to breaking the local mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| mandate, this placed everyone in that building at risk, from the officers working the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| to the citizens who came to the meeting, to the custodial staff who had to clean up afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| And it set a terrible example for citizens who may have been on the fence about the correct way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| to deal with this deadly pandemic. On that day, eight commissioners voted to approve a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| which undercut the Board of Health and made it difficult, if not impossible, to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| common-sense measures such as a mask mandate. As of the October 26th meeting, 101 Knox Countyans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| had died. The day after the November meeting, Knox County set a record with seven deaths in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| By this point, around 130 Knoxvillians had died, and all indications were that we were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| have a rough and deadly holiday season. For the December meeting, the county leadership could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=3993)|

| 1:06:52| six of you voted to remove the power of the Board of Health completely. By this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| 266 Knox Countyans had died. There is nothing we can do for the more than 400 dead Knox Countyans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| and there is not a lot we can do for the 4,000-plus Knox Countyans who are currently infected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| but you can still provide leadership to the community, our community. You can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| clear, non-politicized, science-backed leadership on how to fight the disease and slow the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4034)|

| 1:07:41| and you will be remembered for your actions. I urge you, please, to continue to give the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4061)|

| 1:08:23| We'll start with PCR tests. Remember last fall when some of us called to question the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| amplification cycles on the PCR test? Well, last week, the World Health Organization updated their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4107)|

| 1:08:37| positive results when cycle threshold needed to detect the virus is proportional to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| patient's viral load. When test results do not correspond with clinical presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| as in symptoms, a new specimen should be obtained and retested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| Hmm. It also states that disease prevalence alters the predictive values of test results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| as disease prevalence decreases the risk of false positive increase. So basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| if you're asymptomatic, you're likely a false positive. This is the gold standard of testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| that the Board of Health and the Health Department has lauded, even though we and many experts have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4146)|

| 1:09:36| at a loss as to what to do. Her 89-year-old grandmother fell three weeks ago in her garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| and hit her head on the deep freezer. She went to the ER. When she refused the COVID test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| they became dismissive. They didn't even look at her neck or head. She says it's so painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| They made her wait in the ER for five hours before they even saw her, didn't do any testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| Finally, her grandma said, I'm not leaving without a CT scan at least. And they finally did one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| But her grandmother, who has no mental issues and no deficits, said, I'm not leaving without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| a CT scan. And they finally did one. But when she said she wasn't in there for two minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4209)|

| 1:10:26| look at her neck or the back of her head. She claims it's so painful. She's had a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| dizzy spells, but mainly just pain. It really upsets me that she's not being cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| An 89-year-old woman with a head injury, and they wanted to COVID test her. That doesn't seem right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| to me. I had to speak up and question the nurse practitioner, and she looked at me like, how dare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| I? Then they were almost bullying her about getting the test. I referred her to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| who will actually treat her. Unfortunately, I've heard stories like this over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| from friends and family. Lack of treatment and forced testing just to be seen or treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4254)|

| 1:11:42| to speak tonight. I want to talk about the Board of Health. After more than 400 of our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| have died, and many more sick, the pandemic is still with us and possibly we'll be seeing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| deadly variants. The Board of Health is actively being threatened with being abolished. Who does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| it hurt when you make this threat? The staff of the health department, nurses, doctors, and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| medical providers in Knoxville, and everyone who lives in Knoxville. Because you are threatening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| to take away the medical experts that we need and that we rely on for accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| I understand that businesses are complaining that regulations are making it hard for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| survive. But there are businesses in the city that are managing. The few in the city that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| complying are contributing to the ongoing spread and will have consequences such as losing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| licenses. This is logical and a good application of the law. On the other hand, the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4363)|
| 1:12:51| Sheriff's Department is not forcing compliance with the health department's regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| They offer thoughts and prayers when one of their own dies, but they don't seem to make the logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| jump to their stance of non-enforcing the regulation. And what are the results of non-compliance in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| County? No penalties for the businesses. So I believe that most businesses could survive if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| there were more penalties for non-compliance. I believe it was Carson Daly who was worried that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| we would be throwing people in jail with little cause. But currently, the businesses in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| County are not being held to any standard, and we are all losing. You know those plaques on public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4410)|
| 1:13:38| buildings that said who was in office when it was built? I think you should be concerned about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| you will appear in history when the time and story of this deadly pandemic is reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4424)|
| 1:13:52| This is not the time for a change. Don't just vote to postpone this. It just prolongs the tension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| among the people who are helping us through this pandemic. Please vote to send this motion to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| scrap heap of bad ideas. I appreciate your listening. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| Next up on our list are Gene Burr, Jenna Mashburn, Courtney Shea, Nan Scott, and Edward Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| I'll look for Gene Burr next. Oh, there you are. If you would unmute yourself, Mr. Burr,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4463)|
| 1:14:31| and state your name and your county of residence for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| and you'll have up to five minutes to address commission, and you're still on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4475)|
| 1:14:44| It's usually on the bottom left there. There you are. Is that okay? Yes, sir. If you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4484)|
| 1:14:53| please state your name and your county of residence, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gene Burr. I live in Knox County, 3621 Maloney Road. It's a pleasure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| address the commission on this subject. Very important to us, particularly in this day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4503)|
| 1:15:11| time. I want to declare that I am not a disinterested bystander in this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| of this issue. My wife and I are 86, 88. We're considered part of the vulnerable population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4519)|
| 1:15:27| so to speak. We tried to sign up for vaccine when it first started being shipped to East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| and we couldn't get on the waiting list in Knox County, so we called Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| and they said, okay, we'll put you on our waiting list, and you're number 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| Needless to say, that wasn't the most reassuring, but we hope that if we're careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| and that if our fellow Knox Countians will wear masks and help us protect each other, that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| survive. My first point I wanted to make, Mr. Chairman, is that I think, and it's been stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4560)|
| 1:16:10| eloquently, that the Board of Health is constituted to be able to deal with the kind of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| that they have to deal with, and I think the county commission has a unique capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| that I think lies in a different area, and I'd like to make some points in that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| but I think the important thing for me, as far as the Board of Health goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| is that they be held accountable to do the job they're appointed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| and to make sure we don't do anything that would undermine that capability, and that can't be said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4602)|
| 1:16:51| with sufficient emphasis, but I think the point's been well made. The other thing I wanted to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| out, Mr. Chairman, and members of the commission, is that there are things that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| can do, and I think those fall into the areas of support for our local economy in ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4623)|
| 1:17:14| are appropriate. We know that certain businesses, because of the nature of the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| have been asked to cooperate by limiting their hours, limiting the number of people that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| allow in, and I think it's those businesses that I would like to encourage you and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| to incentivize in the disposition of any kind of financial support that becomes available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4654)|
| 1:17:43| so that we know, the police department and the Board of Health know which businesses those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| that have cooperated with safety precautions as far as the pandemic goes, and so it's with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4668)|
| 1:17:56| caveat on the front end that I'd like to mention some of the things that I was less aware of until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| I had the opportunity to do some reading on it. One thing that was mentioned to me is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| well, and we may not all be aware of this, is that the sales tax in Knox County is up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| this year, which puts us in a position to have more resources than we may have had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4694)|
| 1:18:26| Tennessee, and in this regard, I realize that the Knox County Commission can't substitute itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4706)|
| 1:18:34| for the state legislature, but we do have something called our local legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| who can assist us in guiding the state in using the resources of the state in the most appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| and most constructive manner. Some of the things that I was unaware of before is that Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| has spent 732 million dollars in unspent federal funds, where we've all heard about all the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4733)|
| 1:19:02| that was allocated to help poor families that was just being kind of bankrolled and being put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4742)|
| 1:19:10| rainy day funds, and I think to encourage through our state legislative delegation the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| appropriate use of those funds I think is one thing that the county commission can certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| Tennessee has also had 200 million dollars in unallocated relief funds from last year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| stimulus, I understand, that those funds through the governor and his task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4770)|
| 1:19:39| could allocate to assist small businesses. 16 million dollars of the state's 200 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4779)|
| 1:19:49| went to Knox County businesses, which is encouraging. That shows that some state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| resources are going to help our local businesses. Mr. Burr, your time is up. If you could just wrap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| up your comments, please. Well, I will, and the comment that I'd like to make, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| is that I was surprised that 98 percent, we have 98 percent less cases of flu in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4807)|
| 1:20:17| because of the habits of mask wearing as a direct result of that in the eyes of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4817)|
| 1:20:26| folks they're supposed to know about that, and I think if we have that kind of positive result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| from mask wearing, it should encourage us to follow that guideline with some dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4831)|
| 1:20:40| and enthusiasm. Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Burr. Next up is Jenna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| Mashburn. If you would turn your camera on and make yourself known. Am I saying that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4846)|
| 1:20:55| You've got it right. Thank you. Ms. Mashburn, if you would. And thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| No problem. Just state your name and your county residence for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| and then you have five minutes. Jenna Mashburn, Knox County. I imagine that every person here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| tonight and probably every person in our community can agree on two things. Number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| we want the deadly virus to be eradicated. I look at those numbers every day. I heard the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| from rural metro talk about his colleague who had died from it. I myself had a sister die last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4882)|
| 1:21:29| not here in Knox County, but behind all the numbers that we see are people, a member of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4889)|
| 1:21:36| community, who is either sick or has died. The second thing I think we all agree on is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| want a robust economy. We all want small business owners and large business owners to succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| for our restaurants and our bars to return to normal. Those two wishes are not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| Ms. Mashburn looks like has frozen. Rob, why don't you, I'm going to hold her time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4917)|
| 1:22:14| maybe you can see if you can mute her or get her back online. And I'm going to go to our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| member, which is Courtney Shea. And then if you can let me know if Ms. Mashburn gets back online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| we'll give her time back. Courtney Shea, are you with us? I am with you. Okay, if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| turn your volume up, it's quite low, or just speak up. If you would please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| and your county of residence, and you'll have up to five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| My name is Courtney Shea. I have lived in Knox County for 40 years and still live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| I ask you to oppose the ordinance disbanding the Board of Health for four reasons. First,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| I'm a mother. My two daughters who work in Knox County retail, both contracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| COVID at work despite scrupulous mask wearing. The youngest still has not recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| In my extended family across the country, others have had COVID. One has died. One is still on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| oxygen months after contracting the virus. As our elected officials, your first priority should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| doing everything possible to protect the lives of our citizens. This ordinance overburdens our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| health director and does nothing to protect our health. Second, this ordinance is not good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| government and fails the test of being in the best interest of Knox County. I submit you've given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| insufficient attention to the long history in our state of Boards of Health and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| powers to address epidemics. Historically, our state legislature and our county government have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| found that through painful experience that emergency epidemic measures have been legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| and most effectively exercised through Boards of Health. 140 years ago, our state empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5043)|
| 1:24:12| the Board of Health to issue regulations to address epidemics. Emergency health regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| are not unconstitutional. A drastic departure from historical authority should not be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5057)|
| 1:24:25| in the midst of this crippling epidemic. This is bad timing. This ordinance will do nothing to aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5065)|
| 1:24:33| small businesses. I personally am afraid to go into beloved local stores because so many folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| do not wear masks or they leave them half on. I believe this ordinance has encouraged an attitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| of skepticism about government institutions, such as our Board of Health, has fostered and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| encouraged folks to disregard the public calls to take health precautions. I'm not alone in avoiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5093)|
| 1:25:00| local retail. I know it has had an impact. This ordinance discourages me further. And fourth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5100)|
| 1:25:08| this ordinance is not the will of the people. I've lived here for 40 years. In my local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5108)|

| 1:25:32| Yeah, she just she just came back in. Okay, if you could set the timer back at four minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| and we will call on Ms. Mashburn again and hope that her feed comes through loud and clear. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5138)|
| 1:25:47| Mashburn, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Okay, Rob, let me let you get her back in the queue. And I will move on to Nan Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5149)|
| 1:25:58| Nan Scott, are you with us? If you would please turn your camera on and make yourself known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5158)|

| 1:26:28| Mr. Patrick, Edward Patrick, there you are. If you would please, sir, please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| and your county of residence. And maybe tilt your camera up just a little bit so we can see your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| face. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There you go. And you have five minutes to address the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I apologize for the delay. I'm legally blind. So, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5205)|
| 1:26:55| in the event that I get anywhere near, maybe within one minute of my time, if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| please let me know. Yes, sir. I can't see the clock, much less read it. So let me say my name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| is Edward Patrick, and I am a longtime resident of Knox County. The situation that we're in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5226)|
| 1:27:14| it reminds me of a proverb that I learned when I was growing up, don't change horses in midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5234)|
| 1:27:23| And I traced that back with the help of the Knox County Public Library Reference Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| always helpful. And they traced it back to Lincoln's 1864 campaign when he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5250)|
| 1:27:39| I may not be the smartest guy for this job, and I'm certainly not the only person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| but I believe you should not swap horses in the middle of the river. And I think his words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5266)|
| 1:27:57| are a more accurate description of our situation. This is not a stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| this is a river. And what we're seeing from this resolution, and I respect the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5281)|
| 1:28:08| that we're under so much stress, all of us, that sometimes we say, I've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| And this resolution does something. I think, with all due respect, I think it is the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| of foolishness to pursue this resolution at this time. Now, I heard the speakers earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5299)|
| 1:28:28| talk about how the number of cases have gone up so high and the number of deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5308)|
| 1:28:36| But I was heartened, actually, and we've been following those numbers very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| In the last couple of weeks, it looked like those numbers were coming down. And we had vaccines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5321)|
| 1:28:48| and we had more vaccines on the horizon. So it seemed like there was really light at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| the tunnel, for real. And then, just shortly after I heard those better series of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5334)|
| 1:29:06| I heard that there is a UK variant, which may be and is likely to be more contagious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| than the current original COVID. And then I heard that there is a South African variant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5354)|
| 1:29:25| that is likely to be more contagious and or more lethal than the original virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5365)|
| 1:29:33| And the doctors say, we believe these virus, vaccines rather, will be effective against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5373)|
| 1:29:41| these new strains, but we don't know because we have not tested them. So leaving aside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5381)|
| 1:29:49| problem of getting the vaccines, which is a nightmare, we have now evidence, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5389)|
| 1:29:57| trying to keep it out of our country, but it didn't work very well last time. And it's very hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| keep that kind of disease and maintain the United States as an island. So we have a situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5403)|
| 1:30:13| we were starting to come around the bend, and now we're hit with a double whammy of new variants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| And the resolution proposes to abandon the organization which has essentially gotten us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5419)|
| 1:30:29| with their ideas of masks and with social distancing, which came, of course, from the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| and has been implemented in this county to widespread acceptance, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5436)|
| 1:30:45| Anyway, we're abandoning that organization, and it strikes me as the exact opposite of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| Lincoln said, the exact wrong thing to do. And paraphrasing him again, I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| that I entreat you to stay on the horse you've been riding till you get safe to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5460)|
| 1:31:10| About 45 seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| Thank you. That's all I have. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Thank you, Mr. Patrick. And I'm going to go back to Ms. Mashburn. I believe you're back with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| On the better connection, Ms. Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5483)|
| 1:31:34| Ms. Mashburn. Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| She's in the meeting, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| Ms. Mashburn, if you could turn your camera on and microphone on, and we'll start your clock over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| again. And Rob, you have no one named Nan Scott in the waiting room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| No, sir. The waiting room is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| Here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| There you are, Ms. Mashburn. If you could, I will start the clock again at four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| I apologize. We've got a lot of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| Okay. If you have two things on at the same time, turn them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| I know it. I'm trying to get...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| All right. If you would, we'll start the timer again and pick up where you left off. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| Just to recap where I began, the two issues that we're concerned about, public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| the economy. They're not in conflict. They should not be in competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| We know that the economy will rebound when the virus is under control. And the only way to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| the virus under control is to follow our Board of Health and also to hope that the vaccine becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5565)|
| 1:32:54| much more widespread. Please, don't ever, tonight, commissioners, or the next month, or the months to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| come, consider eliminating the Board of Health. Leave them alone. Let them do their jobs without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| fear. You commissioners, as Mr. Burr was talking about, have a lot on your plate. You have plenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| of things to do. And for starters, you could try to influence the state government so that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5597)|
| 1:33:25| so-called rainy day fund, and goodness knows, if this isn't a rainy day, I don't know what is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| that those funds are loosened and that we can get support in the way of low interest loans or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| grants to our small businesses. Once we can do all of that, we will be on the other side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5617)|
| 1:33:46| So, I implore you to let the Board of Health do their job. You do yours, and we'll all get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5626)|
| 1:33:54| through this together. Thank you, and I do apologize for my technology problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5634)|
| 1:34:13| Chairman, you're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| It's an equal opportunity problem. Sorry about that. That concludes the end of our public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| and we will move on. Before going too much further, I do want to move up item number 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| and then we're going to take the regular order because we have a lot of people in the waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5673)|

| 1:39:04| Mr. Moon, are you, are you a economist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| I have a master's degree in business from the University of Tennessee. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| the amount of, you know, much of what we do is economic in nature, in terms of running analyses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5957)|
| 1:39:25| and economic trends. And so I do not work for an economics concern, but you'll have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5965)|
| 1:39:36| whether or not I meet the qualifications to suit your needs as an economist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| Thank you very much. Any other questions for Mr. Moon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Moon, for joining us. Is Mr. DeGennaro with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5986)|
| 1:39:58| I am here. I'm trying to get my video. There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| If you could state your name and address for the record, and if you could introduce yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6002)|

| 1:40:11| My name is Raymond DeGennaro. I live in the 37919 zip code. I am a professor of finance at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6011)|
| 1:40:21| University of Tennessee. I've lived in Knoxville since joining the university in 1990. My education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6021)|
| 1:40:29| is a PhD in finance with a minor in economics. I think the number one thing that I would bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6029)|
| 1:40:37| to this committee is that I intend to inform the committee, not persuade the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6037)|
| 1:40:47| My job is not to make policy. My job is to say that if the committee does this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| then this is something that might happen. If the committee does something else, then that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| happen. And it's the committee's job to decide which of those outcomes it wishes to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| One thing economists do quite well is look at incentives and see what is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6066)|
| 1:41:15| behind the blackboard. We often impose some policy to solve one problem, and we never consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6075)|
| 1:41:24| what incentives that sets up in terms of other human behavior that might lead to outcomes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| are good or bad. That is essentially what economists do. I think it's an important factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| for the committee to consider, and as I've said, my job is to inform the committee on what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| policy decisions would mean. Is there any questions for Mr. DeGennaro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| Okay. Thank you very much, sir. Seeing none, I will move on to Candice Vioxx. I hope I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6110)|

| 1:52:06| I also look forward to supporting Dr. Buchanan and our health department in any way that I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| in fighting this scourge of COVID-19. We need their leadership and guidance in fighting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| worst public health threat our nation has confronted in over 100 years. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| Thank you, Dr. Williams. Is there any questions from the commissioner, from Dr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6741)|
| 1:52:29| Okay. The last person that's part of this resolution is Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| Commissioner Lundy, did you want to add anything else to the conversation or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| I just want to say it's an honor to serve. I know it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| people did not like this committee. I got a lot of pushback, but as a healthcare provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| I do understand that the mental health aspect is very important. A lot of my patients are not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| good since we've been in this pandemic for a while now. And I'm honored to serve and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| I'm bringing my commission side and my physical therapy side to this committee. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| Commissioner Smith, your hand is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's misreported by a local reporter that I asked for a urologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6792)|
| 1:53:19| to be on this board. As someone that's had a kidney stone, I have begged for a urologist before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| but what I was referring to was a biologist. And Dr. Buchanan had said no one had stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6805)|
| 1:53:33| biologist. And Dr. Buchanan had said no one had stepped forward. I was wondering if Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6813)|
| 1:53:41| has had anybody from that field that has stepped forward because it was one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6821)|
| 1:53:49| occupations listed in the ordinance. Is Dr. Buchanan still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6829)|
| 1:53:57| I don't know, but I know that if she's not, I think Dwight VandeVate from the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6837)|
| 1:54:04| was running a point on the thing and had told us that no one had applied. But Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6844)|
| 1:54:12| I see you there if you want to. I'm sorry, I'm still here. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| urology is a pretty specific and limited field. And so I reached out to local hospitals to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6857)|
| 1:54:27| if they had a urologist on staff. None of them did. So we sent the information to the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| and asked them to share it broadly across the university. Again, we didn't get any applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6873)|
| 1:54:38| So I don't personally know any urologists at all. Dr. Buchanan, that's what I'm hearing too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6878)|
| 1:54:46| amongst the people I asked, that it's very specialized field and there may not actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| be any that live in this area. With that said, I know we can't do this tonight, but I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6890)|
| 1:55:00| someone to add to this board committee would be an actuary. I think someone that knows numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6900)|
| 1:55:11| that knows the science of math, is also a good person to have on this board to be advising us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| whatever it is that this board is going to advise us for in the future. And I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6917)|
| 1:55:24| make clear right now, my position of appointing these people to this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6924)|
| 1:55:31| is not to replace the Board of Health, but it's to have a different set of people looking at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6931)|
| 1:55:38| differently beyond medical issues, economic issues, a lot of different issues. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6938)|
| 1:55:48| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Is there any other discussion on item number 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6948)|
| 1:55:58| Okay. Item 15 has a motion by Commissioner Daly and a second by Commissioner Durrett for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=6958)|

| 2:07:16| hear the recommendation from planning and then hear from the applicant. And then what I'll do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7636)|
| 2:07:23| go through and hear from the opposition, and then we can open it up to discuss it from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7643)|
| 2:07:31| after we do. Actually, you know what? Sorry, let me do this. Let me get the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| first, then we'll do the motion, and then I'll go through that. So Ms. Brooks, if you could start us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| with the staff recommendation. Sure. Planning Commission recommends that County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| approve a agricultural zoning because it is consistent with the Northwest County Sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7667)|

| 2:08:41| the opposition, and then we'll open it up for questions. So, Mr. Bartholomew, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7721)|
| 2:08:48| please take the floor. All right. Thank you for the opportunity to address Commission. With me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7728)|

| 2:09:00| if you all have any questions later. We ask that Commission approve the rezoning of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| to agricultural, which MPC Commission and MPC staff both have recommended. This is a downzone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7745)|
| 2:09:13| from PR. Currently, the property is zoned PR, four units per acre, and downzoning this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| reverse a PR spot zone. The adjacent property is either zoned agricultural or low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| residential. If the use was anything else, this item would be on consent, and people would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7764)|

| 2:09:39| the misinformation, I will attempt to highlight some of the main points. The first is why this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| property, and is it compatible with the neighborhood. The property has always been used as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| group home. This property was originally built as a group home for children in 1969, and operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| until 1987 as such. From 1987 to 2011, it was a group home for the elderly. This property was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7795)|
| 2:10:03| built and designed to be used as a group home, and for over 40 years, it has never been used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7803)|

| 2:10:14| Since Zion Home for the Aged closed, the property has been deteriorating. The property is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| in a state of disrepair and severely blighted. The second is who we are and how do we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7819)|

| 2:10:31| It is not a rehabilitation facility. In order for men to be admitted into our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7831)|

| 2:10:41| These men are going into people's houses and picking up furniture or other items that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| been donated to Angelic. The men then work at the warehouse, running equipment, driving trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| and interacting with our church volunteers, including young children. This is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| structured program with a proven track record that these men follow. At Angelic Ministries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| we have held community meetings, opened our doors, invited questions, all in hopes of showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| the community who Angelic Ministries is and what we intend to do with the facility on Zion Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| We have been open and transparent in this process. We all know that there is a need in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7870)|
| 2:11:16| but no one wants the solution to be around them. We need these places to be everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| in every zone, in every district. These men and women are already among us. They're living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| the shadows. The place to deal with this is not the criminal justice system. The answer is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| to build more jails, and the answer is definitely not to condemn these men and women forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| We must figure out how to stop the downward slide. We as a community will either decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| that we must deal with this head-on, or we will continue to have the same results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| Once again, the question before you tonight is a simple down-zone request from PR to Agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| and I humbly ask all of you to approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| Thank you very much, Mr. Bartholomew. Our first speaker tonight is Mr. Christopher Vallee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7913)|
| 2:12:03| Mr. Vallee, are you with us? And if so, if you would please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| turn your camera on and make yourself known so we can identify you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7928)|

| 2:12:17| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have five minutes to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| commission. All right. So my name is Christopher Vallee. I live in Huntcrest Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7941)|
| 2:12:26| which is across from Zion Lane, 3124 Champions Trail Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7946)|
| 2:12:33| Okay. And if you would go ahead, sir. So from the get-go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| no, they have not been transparent, but I won't digress. We've been told as of October when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| sign first got put up, actually there was no sign put up originally for the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| until somebody found it on the embassy agenda. We got a sign put up. There was no notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| sent out. Once we found out, and because it was under the architect, we had trouble figuring out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| what it was. And at this time, they still haven't saying where these men will come from. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7980)|
| 2:13:10| did not deny in the grace meeting that they can be anybody in between sex offenders and violent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7990)|
| 2:13:17| criminal offenders. And not that they're going to be violent offenders or sex offenders, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=7997)|
| 2:13:24| those won't be included. But when I asked specifically in the grace meeting that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| held, then it could be anybody on probation, people just released, people who have been referred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| people that have any type of record, people that would be up to detox. And their answer was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| well, we're not saying they're going to be that. So they've never admitted who's going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| The only thing they've admitted is that these people need 24-7 supervision. They've even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| threatened that if they don't get to board and approval, which we do have an appeal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| NPC, because board and approval, which is why they're being degraded, only says 12 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8034)|
| 2:13:59| and board and doesn't say any services you're going to provide. So anything above board and home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| is in the board and home. We were also told by the NPC and numerous county commission members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8045)|
| 2:14:11| that downgrading is impossible to fight, that discussion of intent is not what needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8051)|
| 2:14:18| discussed. It was never discussed on the NPC board, even though Angelic Ministries postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8058)|
| 2:14:24| this twice to clear the air when we are being told that agricultural is the only thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| needs to be discussed. Now, y'all set precedents in July of 2020. You set precedents with 6A20RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8070)|
| 2:14:39| where somebody wanted to go from a RN1 single-family residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| and they wanted to go down to agricultural, and it was denied because it says zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| because it's not consistent with the zone state and intent, nor is it. So y'all set precedents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| to discuss intent and what it was going to be used for back in June 11, 2020, on 6A20RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8095)|
| 2:15:04| Yet we've been told constantly that we cannot talk about what it's going to be used for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| that it's just agricultural. This is spot zoning. When the place was built, there were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| subdivisions. The subdivisions were built afterwards. The home closed down as in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8113)|
| 2:15:20| blight because the homeowner hasn't taken care of it. And then it got moved up to more matching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8120)|
| 2:15:28| what's around it. Adjacent should also include Huntcrest subdivisions, Foxfield, and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| other subdivisions. And PR was closer to what was around there than spot zoning to make it back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8133)|
| 2:15:41| So if you approve the agricultural, they're going to still try to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| board home approved. When you start growing the business and the Chaud Road extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| all that comes in, you won't be able to put anything next to that, turn it into PR again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| because it's too close to a board home. So they're trying to spot zone. It only benefits them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8155)|

| 2:16:08| And the community that supports it, for the most part, is people who don't live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| in the Parnes area. So at the end of the day, it should not be approved. You should discuss intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| because you've already set the precedence in June 11, 2020. And we have an appeal file that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8178)|
| 2:16:27| going to go on if this gets approved, because a board home is more, a board home is 12 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8187)|
| 2:16:34| with a lodging. If you do anything in addition to that, which is a segregated population that has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8194)|
| 2:16:40| have 24-7 supervision, and it's not set up for a fair house, and so nobody can just apply for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8200)|
| 2:16:48| as a part of the program, then this is not a regular board home. So if a board home could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| be anything except for 12 people for lodging, then that could be a rehab, that could be anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8214)|
| 2:17:00| because you should only define it by based on what it states. Anything outside of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| doesn't apply. And the only reason why they're trying to go to agriculture spot zoning is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| they can put that board home in. I know that was quick, but I don't know how much time I got left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| That's okay. Thank you, Mr. Valle. Your time is up. And I, just a clarification, usually we give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| five minutes to the applicant and five minutes to the opposition, but we had somebody, we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8241)|

| 2:17:32| So thank you, Mr. Valle, for your comments. I'm going to go to Joseph Lake next. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8252)|
| 2:17:38| you don't have to use all the five minutes, but if you would, please state your name and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8258)|

| 2:17:56| Commissioners, thank you all for allowing me to speak today on the topic of the rezoning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| the parcel at Zion Lane from planned residential to agriculture. While I'm here to request that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| you deny this down zoning proposal based on two items, those being number one, the notion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| going backward from planned residential zone to agricultural zone is not consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8290)|
| 2:18:15| current trajectory of the surrounding area, nor the northwest county sector plan. And number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| the application as submitted does not provide reasonable justification for the downgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| in zoning. To provide a little bit of history on this parcel of land, in 2012, a request was put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| in and approved to upgrade the zoning from agriculture to planned residential. At the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| the rationale was provided that PR zoning is consistent with the sector plan and will allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8318)|
| 2:18:43| uses compatible with the surrounding area. Additionally, the commission goes on to indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| that the approval of the request could lead a future request for PR zoning. The commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| were seemingly correct in their assessment, as this area has seen an explosion of residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| growth since that time. Further, the northwest sector plan states that the areas of proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| to Zion Lane are well suited for residential uses and office uses. There is no mention of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8342)|
| 2:19:09| agriculture being a use that is consistent with this area. And truly, as a resident of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8349)|
| 2:19:15| as other residents can attest, we have seen and heard the progress in this area since 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8355)|

| 2:19:55| specific history of this land, it is well established that we are in a planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| area on the growth policy where a PR zone is appropriate. The notion of down zoning this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| parcel of land is inconsistent with the sector plan and could have negative impacts on the forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| progress of this area. You know, in order to consider rezoning, it would require a strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| justification to commit to this course of action, and this is why I bring up my second point, as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| application for down zoning does not provide this reasonable justification. As I'm sure the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| commission is aware, one of the required criteria for approving a rezoning is that the approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8423)|
| 2:20:29| amendment, and I quote, the proposed amendment shall be necessary because of substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| changed or changing conditions in the areas and districts affect or in the city county in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| However, the evidence provided is that the area is a mix of residential and this property was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| previously zoned agricultural. Stating what has been known, planned for, and acted upon the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| eight years does not change a substantial change away from the plan, and neither is saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| this plot of land was previously zoned for what they're asking it to be downgraded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| This application does not meet a reasonable standard for demonstrating evidence that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| be deemed substantial change in conditions in the area to justify a down zoning back to agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| In conclusion, I'd like to reiterate my request that the commission deny this application to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| down zone this parcel of land to an agricultural zone and keep it as planned residential. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| growth plan and trajectory of this area dictate forward progress toward planned communities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| beyond to accommodate the growing population of Knox County. Without strong justification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| only plausible actions to demand this request. I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8489)|

| 2:22:42| You know, I'm going to bring up something that's not really been discussed and we've not had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8562)|
| 2:22:49| accurate answer that's satisfied me or many others that have had concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8569)|
| 2:22:58| The, you know, we received a letter in the mail. I've got it here showing from Angelic Ministries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8578)|
| 2:23:06| saying, you know, we're not going to house, we're not going to be a drug rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8586)|

| 2:23:21| We're not going to, you know, the list goes on here, but, you know, there's reasons that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| go to jail and, you know, what does that leave? That leaves theft. That leaves all of us vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8608)|
| 2:23:40| to this kind of activity in our neighborhood that doesn't need to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8620)|

| 2:24:09| It doesn't fit. The facility is in bad shape. It was, you know, it's a multi-room facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8649)|
| 2:24:20| It has 20 bedrooms. The basement of the facility is not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| You know, and everything that I've looked into, a boarding house only allows 12 people or 12 occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8665)|
| 2:24:35| So, something else that I tried to look up and read into said that, and this was through the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8675)|
| 2:24:44| that depending on what type of boarding facility or what type home it is, that you could have up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8684)|
| 2:24:51| two occupants per bedroom. So, this letter that we received from Angelic Ministries does not tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8691)|
| 2:24:58| they're only going to have 12 people there. It doesn't tell us they're only going to have 20 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| because they got 20 bedrooms. The state of Tennessee says that, if I understood it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8702)|
| 2:25:09| that they can have up to two people per bedroom. Now, if the basement of this facility is finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8709)|
| 2:25:19| this is a 20,000 square foot building, if you count the basement. If you double the number of bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| that's 40 bedrooms, that's a possibility of 80 occupants. There's a high, a really high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8726)|
| 2:25:34| recidivism rate with this. There's a failure rate with boarding houses, halfway houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8734)|
| 2:25:42| all that being said. So, my concern with all this, I've already brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| but I ask you to deny this request. We don't need it here. I know these men need help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8748)|
| 2:25:56| but this is just not a good fit. This is not a good neighborhood for it. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8756)|

| 2:26:47| Okay. The thing that concerns me about this is, and I've read studies that say that halfway houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8807)|
| 2:26:56| do not affect the local crime rate. And I've looked into those studies, and what I've discovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| is they are typically done on a halfway house that is built in a neighborhood that's already a high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8822)|
| 2:27:08| crime rate neighborhood. And those studies don't apply to this because this is a very low crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| rate community. I looked at a story. It was in by the Century Foundation. It's dated June the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8835)|
| 2:27:23| 23rd, 2015. And it goes over a lot of statistics involving facilities like this where they house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8843)|
| 2:27:30| people that were freshly released from prison. And most of these communities are owned by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8850)|
| 2:27:38| company called Community Education Centers, but their statistics match what the most common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| statistics are. And that's a 67% recidivism rate. And as we spoke earlier, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| And as we spoke earlier, you know, most of the people that's going to be here that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| been released from prison, it's probably going to be drug or theft charges. And lo and behold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8876)|
| 2:28:01| the most common recidivism or crime is a property crime. That being said, most halfway houses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8881)|
| 2:28:10| I have found on those studies have been located in higher crime areas to start with, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8890)|
| 2:28:16| they're almost exclusively built in areas where there's public transportation, where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8896)|
| 2:28:23| jobs available within walking distance, or they can take public transportation to the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8903)|
| 2:28:29| opportunities. And there's sidewalks for because a lot of these folks are transportation challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8909)|
| 2:28:34| and they have sidewalks available, and a lot of infrastructure nearby within walking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| But what we have here is a structure that has no sidewalks, and no sidewalks on the adjoining road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8920)|
| 2:28:49| There's no job opportunities within walking distance. And there's no public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8929)|
| 2:28:57| The other thing is there's four acres of ground here to expand. So once this is approved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8937)|
| 2:29:03| expansions, there's no telling how big of a facility this could grow to. So what my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8943)|
| 2:29:11| is, is moving people into this community that is a very low crime community with no opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8951)|
| 2:29:20| walking to a job or taking a public bus to a job that are individuals that are statistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8960)|
| 2:29:26| speaking, have a very high rate for property crime. The recidivism rate is 67% for a halfway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8966)|
| 2:29:34| house. And I think that these reasons are why typically halfway houses are generally built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8974)|
| 2:29:42| in an area where there is public transportation, there's sidewalks, and where the crime rate is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8982)|
| 2:29:47| little bit lacking already, so that it doesn't impact the community. There's also an article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8987)|
| 2:29:54| from the 2012 New York Times, a lot of people who go to halfway houses are finishing out a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| So they are getting a part of a parole or an early release from prison and they spend the last few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9001)|
| 2:30:06| months there in a halfway house. The most common form of prison escape is when they walk away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9006)|
| 2:30:15| a halfway house and just don't come back. And that's according to a 2012 New York Times article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| and according to the 2015 article by the Century Foundation that studied these halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9021)|
| 2:30:28| And that being said, I just don't think this is the right community for this particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9028)|
| 2:30:35| Thank you very much, Mr. Mays. As I've afforded some extra time to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9035)|
| 2:30:40| opposition, Mr. Bartholomew, did you or your associates want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| add anything to the conversation before we move to Commissioner comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| Yes, thank you, Chairman. Just a couple things. I know you guys have a long night ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| On the jobs, Angelic Ministries provides the jobs. So when people come into our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9054)|
| 2:31:02| they're not going out and looking for jobs. They're working in the ministry. So we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| transportation to and from the facilities. So they're not going out looking for a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9067)|
| 2:31:15| Part of our program, it's a year-long program, and they work with us for the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9075)|
| 2:31:24| And that schedule has been provided. I hope the commissioners got it. It was provided multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9084)|
| 2:31:32| times at MPC. And so that's on the job front. As far as how many people will be housed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9092)|
| 2:31:41| boardinghouse, we're going to house what we're permitted to. And so with a agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9101)|
| 2:31:48| and a use on review, use on that property, then we will be limited to 12 people with two staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9108)|
| 2:31:57| That's part of the use on review that's being heard. The appeal is being heard at BZA on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9117)|
| 2:32:03| Also, with it being agricultural, you would not, and that property having the use on review for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| a boardinghouse of 12 with two staff, the property would have that limitation on it. And if we grew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9129)|
| 2:32:17| or expanded, then we would have to come back for another use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9137)|
| 2:32:24| So with PR now, you can have a total of 18 residents there, houses. So downzoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9144)|
| 2:32:32| agricultural with the use on review would limit the number of people there, and that would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| to be looked at through the use on review. Of course, if there's any other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9158)|
| 2:32:43| we're more than happy to answer them. But those were the two items that I didn't want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| Thank you. Thank you very much. Open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9167)|
| 2:32:55| For commissioners, Mr. Bussler, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| Thank you. I was trying to find my unmute button. Daniel Sanders, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9177)|
| 2:33:11| We ran into a situation in my area where a man had combined two acres and had it rezoned and had it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9191)|
| 2:33:21| come back as agricultural. After it's his own agricultural, did he have to come back and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9201)|
| 2:33:29| anything from anybody to set those two boardinghouses that he was working on in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9209)|
| 2:33:35| if you remember that correctly? It was that off of Greenville Drive, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9215)|
| 2:33:43| If a boardinghouse in an agricultural zone is a use permitted on review, so in order to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9223)|
| 2:33:49| a boardinghouse in an agricultural zone, you do have to go through the additional approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9229)|
| 2:33:54| for use on review through both the Planning Commission and the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| Now, was this about a boardinghouse that was added to agricultural? That came from the state. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| didn't come from our own zoning requirements here locally in Knoxville, right? It was added on as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9246)|
| 2:34:15| as a use for that from the state of Tennessee. I believe that was a different zoning altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9255)|
| 2:34:22| That was a house for adults with mental handicaps, and that has a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9262)|
| 2:34:28| zoning designation directly from the state, so I don't think it went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| our local zoning, if I remember correctly. That was under a different state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| and it had no local zoning restrictions whatsoever. It was agricultural, and could that same situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9276)|
| 2:34:44| happen on this piece of property? Mr. Sanders? I am not intimately familiar with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9284)|
| 2:34:53| situation that you mentioned out in your district, but I can speak to the agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9293)|
| 2:35:00| which does require use on review approval for lodging and boardinghouses, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9300)|
| 2:35:07| it really depends on the individual use that the owner is proposing, and I know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9307)|
| 2:35:15| applicant has indicated that there's going to be a boardinghouse use. That, along with any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9315)|
| 2:35:26| use that's permitted or permitted as a use on review in the agricultural zone, will be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| exactly what that use is as a person applies for a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9331)|
| 2:35:38| And so, the item that's before you is whether this property stays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9338)|
| 2:35:47| zoned PR or gets zoned agricultural, and that is a legislative determination. It is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9347)|
| 2:35:57| most deferential standard of review for this body. You should be concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9357)|
| 2:36:06| not only the proposed use, but all of the uses that are permitted or permitted as uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| in either zone to determine what's appropriate for this area, and it's really a broad legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9371)|
| 2:36:20| type determination. You don't necessarily need to ignore what the applicant's proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| but it's a broader, more overarching totality of the circumstances type of consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9388)|
| 2:36:40| you're making here. Okay, but anyway, that's one of the points I was trying to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9400)|
| 2:36:46| is that you go from planned residential to agricultural, there is a number of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9406)|
| 2:36:51| that it can be used for, even though somebody says this is what we're going to use it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| But they can use anything that's allowable in the agricultural zone, correct, if we resolve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9417)|
| 2:37:04| Correct, and the applicant has made the point tonight that similar uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9424)|
| 2:37:16| and maybe even more intense uses are permitted under the current planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9436)|
| 2:37:23| and I don't know that I don't disagree with that. Under the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9443)|
| 2:37:30| the type of use that the applicant has discussed tonight would be arguably a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9450)|
| 2:37:41| that would go through a development plan approval process rather than a use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| under the agricultural zone, which would go through a use on review process, and those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9465)|
| 2:37:55| slightly different, but those processes are different nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| Okay, Daniel, I just wanted to ask you one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| And threw that at you, because that's the last shot I'll have at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| Good luck on your next position. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| I had a question for the applicant. If you don't get the zoning approval tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| what's the plan for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| Yeah, I mean, this property is, our plan with this property would be to go through the PR process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9504)|
| 2:38:32| We're going to get a good idea about what would happen at BZA. So it would be a much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9512)|
| 2:38:39| intensive use that would be permitted there. When we spoke with MPC, both the previous MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9519)|
| 2:38:45| administration and this administration, and then county codes, and we explained what we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9525)|
| 2:38:51| do, they directed us to go down this path for a boarding house in agricultural. They did not think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9531)|
| 2:38:58| that what we were wanting to do fell within the PR zone. And so they said that in order to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9538)|
| 2:39:06| you needed to go back to agricultural. So I mean, you could put apartments there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9546)|
| 2:39:12| you could put 18 units as it's zoned now, you would have to meet development guidelines, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| you could put 18 units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| I also had a question for Commissioner Hill. I want to know her opinion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| since it is in her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| Okay, and you, Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| Yes, yes, absolutely. I think I have met personally, with one exception, with everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9570)|
| 2:39:37| that has spoken tonight. This certainly is not an indictment on Angelic Ministries at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9577)|
| 2:39:44| I think even the residents in the community appreciate what the ministries have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9584)|
| 2:39:54| I need to tell you, though, that my constituents have been very, very adamant, very clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9594)|
| 2:40:02| they do not want this in their neighborhood. I understand that, I appreciate that, and I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9602)|
| 2:40:09| elected to represent my constituents. So I cannot support this. I just, I cannot. It is surrounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9609)|
| 2:40:17| by residential development, and I appreciate where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9617)|
| 2:40:30| Commissioner Ward, did you have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| Thank you, Chairman Jay. This question is to Mr. Bartholomew. This morning, I went out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9635)|
| 2:40:41| obviously, in the rain, and viewed the property. The first building is an L-shaped, looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9641)|
| 2:40:49| building, and then the second building that's the farthest end of the property looks like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| two-story building with no windows in it. Could you explain which, what would occur in both those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9655)|
| 2:41:02| buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| I think those are one building together. The building is a two-story building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9664)|
| 2:41:09| and it's shaped like a T. So I think those are two buildings. There is a building that's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9669)|
| 2:41:16| close to the property line at the rear that used to be, I think, a gymnasium for the children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9676)|
| 2:41:24| home, but that property, the gymnasium at the very, very back is not part of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9684)|
| 2:41:32| At some point in this process, it was, the parcels were split up, and that gymnasium in the back is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9692)|
| 2:41:41| it's virtually on the property line. It's very close. So the building that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| is a T-shaped building. It's two stories and 20,000 square feet. The downstairs basement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9706)|

| 2:41:57| The downstairs basement is completely unfinished, and the upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9717)|
| 2:42:03| is what has been utilized in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| Okay, and I was trying to follow your timeline of who were the former tenants to those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| and I noticed that in November of 2011, a family in Portland, Oregon purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9733)|
| 2:42:21| Has there been anything in the building since 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9741)|
| 2:42:25| To my knowledge, no. There was a couple times that people have tried to rezone it. One time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9745)|
| 2:42:31| it was successfully rezoned to PR. It was, at that point, the plan was to make it an assisted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| living facility, but since 2011, I don't think that anybody's been able to occupy the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9756)|
| 2:42:45| That building was built with a drain field, and so in order to redevelop that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9765)|
| 2:42:53| we're going to have to bring a sewer line up Zion Lane that's never had sewer up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9773)|
| 2:42:59| and also a water line to sprinkle the building, and I think that most of the people that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9779)|
| 2:43:06| well, I can't speak for them, but they were never able to complete their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9786)|
| 2:43:12| for what they were trying to do. Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9792)|
| 2:43:16| My next question is for our Director of Engineering and Public Works, Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9796)|
| 2:43:24| Yeah, go ahead, Commissioner Schoenberg. I noticed that the building is in really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9804)|
| 2:43:32| just, I mean, all the windows are busted, the roof looks like it's in disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9812)|
| 2:43:37| Has there been any complaints for codes enforcement, or, you know, has this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9817)|
| 2:43:42| been looked at as to be condemned, or do you show any records that you guys have been out there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9822)|
| 2:43:50| check on this building? I don't recall anything specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| so that would speak to that we haven't probably seen numerous complaints, not to say there isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9836)|
| 2:44:01| something isolated in the system. I can bear up, I can look at that and verify, but I don't recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9841)|
| 2:44:07| anything in specific that's been a recurring issue, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9847)|
| 2:44:12| Okay, because it looks like it's in pretty extensive disrepair where whoever takes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9852)|
| 2:44:18| this project is going to have to invest a considerable amount of money to get it back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| to code. And then, and thank you, Mr. Snowden, and my last comment was I kind of, when I went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9863)|
| 2:44:31| out and looked at the property and then looked at the surrounding area, I kind of had the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9871)|
| 2:44:36| impression that Mr. Bradley Mays had where, you know, there's no, there's no bus line out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9876)|
| 2:44:46| there's no, there is no jobs out there, it's all residential area. So I guess that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9886)|
| 2:44:53| ministry is going to have to provide bus transportation to, or van transportation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9893)|
| 2:45:00| all of the residents. But anyways, I'll relinquish the floor back to the Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9900)|
| 2:45:09| Thank you, Commissioner Skimbecker. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will start with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9912)|
| 2:45:23| It's my understanding with the current PR zoning, they could go in there and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9923)|
| 2:45:29| 16 units, they could easily build five houses and rent or give free rent to their clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9929)|
| 2:45:42| in these dwellings, correct? Likely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9942)|
| 2:45:49| I looked at the building too. Commissioner Skimbecker, I thought the roof looked fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9949)|
| 2:45:53| new on it. It was the only thing that looked fairly decent. This building is in a very odd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9953)|
| 2:46:00| place. Actually, the PR zoning on it to me is quite strange because on that side of Ball Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9960)|
| 2:46:09| there is no PR zoning. It looks a bit like spot zoning to me. There is a large track of RB zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9969)|
| 2:46:16| next to it that has what it looks like a fairly underdeveloped mobile home park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9976)|
| 2:46:27| I ran into this problem in my district where you have these properties that used to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| as something and somebody wants to use them for something else. I think you guys know what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9993)|
| 2:46:39| talking about. Some of y'all were on commission at the time. I get a little taken back by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=9999)|
| 2:46:48| the whole bus line thing. It seems to me people are saying the only appropriate place for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10008)|
| 2:46:57| opportunities to bring yourself back into society dwell within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10017)|
| 2:47:01| I don't think that's necessarily true. I do often have trouble with just because a building is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10021)|
| 2:47:11| what goes in it. I'm kind of torn on this. I do feel that as a human, as members of our society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10031)|
| 2:47:24| there has to be some place for people who have come out of prison to try to get their life back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10044)|
| 2:47:30| together. I have another question for the law department. We've used halfway house, boarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10050)|
| 2:47:38| house. Is there a technical difference and is there an ordinance difference in our codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10058)|
| 2:47:44| I do not believe that there's a definition for boarding house. I do not believe there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10064)|
| 2:47:53| a specific definition for halfway house in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10073)|
| 2:48:00| Mr. Sanders, while you're looking that up, if it's okay with Mr. Smith, maybe I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10080)|
| 2:48:06| go to the next question and come back when you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| Go to the next question and come back when you have found more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10090)|
| 2:48:14| unless it's right at your fingertips. I don't believe that there's a definition to the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10094)|
| 2:48:21| of my knowledge. There's not a definition for halfway house in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| but there is a definition for boarding house. I can tell you that under the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10105)|
| 2:48:35| zone, it may not really matter what you call this use because the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10115)|
| 2:48:45| provides for, quote unquote, other uses that are deemed compatible with the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10125)|
| 2:48:53| by the planning commission. So there is a possibility this use would go through planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10133)|
| 2:48:59| and board of zoning appeals and would be permitted as an other use, quote unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10139)|
| 2:49:07| that's not specifically defined in the zoning ordinance. If you are in an agricultural setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10147)|
| 2:49:15| then you are going to be sort of cabined in by the uses that are specifically enumerated in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10155)|
| 2:49:21| agricultural zone because the agricultural zone does not contain a sort of catch-all provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10161)|
| 2:49:29| that would allow other uses that are not specifically defined. Does that get to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10169)|
| 2:49:37| question? Commissioner Smith? Yes, yes, it does. Commissioner Wheeler? Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10177)|
| 2:49:52| So, yeah, I really appreciate the concerns that have been voiced by the neighborhood folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10192)|
| 2:50:04| And there's certainly legitimate concerns for anything that might be going into your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10204)|
| 2:50:10| and Mr. Lake made some great points, legal points with regard to zoning. I would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10210)|
| 2:50:17| want to debate him over those points. However, I do have a fundamental belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10217)|
| 2:50:25| that a property owner does have a right to at least apply for a downzoning of his or her property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10225)|
| 2:50:31| especially to what's essentially the lowest developmental level, which is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10231)|
| 2:50:38| And, you know, and I do believe very strongly in Angelic Ministries and in their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10238)|
| 2:50:45| And I think it is desperately needed in our culture and in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10245)|
| 2:50:52| It's one of these things that very few people are going to enthusiastically support in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| neighborhood. I say very few because there are a few that actually would. I don't say that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10256)|
| 2:51:03| say that they're any better than anybody else. I'm simply saying that there are some who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| see this a little bit differently and would welcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10267)|
| 2:51:14| But I don't normally, it's not my protocol to certainly to jump in front of a district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10274)|
| 2:51:20| commissioner for something that's in their district. However, in the absence of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| on the floor, I would like to offer a motion to approve this zoning request as per the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10285)|
| 2:51:32| Commission and for the reason that I think based on kind of the historical intent of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10292)|
| 2:51:41| and facility, the desperate need for this type of facility and based on, again, the fundamental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10301)|
| 2:51:50| rights of a property owner to request a downzoning of their property, I think that this applicant at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10310)|
| 2:51:55| least deserves an up or down vote on approval. And so for that reason, I would offer a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10315)|
| 2:52:00| to approve. Okay, so we currently have a motion from Commissioner Beeler to approve. Is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10320)|
| 2:52:06| second for that motion? Second from Commissioner Ward. Okay. Continuing discussion, I see Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10326)|
| 2:52:15| Daly's line up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Daniel, did I hear you right that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10335)|
| 2:52:24| hear you right, saying that the applicant or the property owner may have a recourse to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| back to under the PR to have use on review for a boardinghouse? It's my understanding that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10349)|
| 2:52:39| applicant currently has a use on review application that will be heard next Wednesday before the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| of Zoning Appeals for the same use but in the existing zone. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10366)|
| 2:52:58| will be leaving the county before that meeting. I reviewed that agenda. I'm sorry to interrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10378)|
| 2:53:04| but it is not in the existing zone. It is a use on review in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10384)|
| 2:53:11| Yeah, you, it kind of got the horse before the cart on this one. It should have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10391)|
| 2:53:17| all the zoning should have been done before they asked for use on review. So, the horse before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10397)|
| 2:53:26| horse on this one. So, you know, this is not a sector plan change. This is, planning says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10406)|
| 2:53:36| they, it's in the sector plans, not a sector plan change. It's a down zone. So, I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10416)|
| 2:53:45| I have a tough time not granting the request because it is back to agricultural. If we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10425)|
| 2:53:55| got a problem with boarding housing and it needs to be put into the PR zone, taken out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10435)|
| 2:54:05| agricultural zone and put into PR zone as use on review for sure. So, we need to probably look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10445)|
| 2:54:11| that. But right now, I'm following the lines of Commissioner Beeler, the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10451)|
| 2:54:19| And I like to follow the rules and the rules. A lot of times the commission, we do things and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10459)|
| 2:54:26| we'll make a decision on one thing, then two requests later, we do absolutely, we do 180| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10466)|
| 2:54:33| degrees what we did before. But on this one, I feel that the property owner should have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10473)|
| 2:54:39| opportunity to down zone to a agricultural. So, and if it's possible, Daniel, can you look it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10479)|
| 2:54:48| real quick and make sure I know that this BZA coming up Wednesday is not a, an appeal for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10488)|
| 2:54:58| PR zone is the appeal for the agricultural zone. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| Right. And I apologize. I stand corrected. The use on review application is an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10503)|
| 2:55:12| from NPC's approval of the use on review. So, apparently NPC has approved this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10512)|
| 2:55:22| And that will be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10522)|
| 2:55:27| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Daly. I have a question before moving on to Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10527)|
| 2:55:33| Can, I think it was Mr. Bartholomew, could you gave some dates at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10533)|
| 2:55:39| for other group homes? Could you repeat what, what is this property been used for? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10539)|
| 2:55:44| what were the dates of that? Yeah. So the property was built in 1969 as a children's home. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10544)|
| 2:55:52| it operated as a children's home until 1987. In 1987 to 2011, it was a, it was Zion home for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10552)|
| 2:56:02| home for the aged. And there's an NPC report in 2005 that listed Zion home for the aged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10562)|
| 2:56:13| I believe it had 20 beds at the time there was 20 occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10573)|
| 2:56:20| So, and then in 2011, it ceased to operate as, as a group home of any sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10580)|
| 2:56:28| And yeah, it ceased to operate. In 2012, there was a rezoning to PR to try to get it to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10588)|
| 2:56:36| assisted living facility. I don't know why they weren't able to complete the construction, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10596)|
| 2:56:42| since 2011, it hasn't operated. Okay. Thank you very much for that. Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10602)|
| 2:56:49| I feel the same way Commissioner Beeler does about the vote part. My brain is trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10609)|
| 2:56:54| compute all this. I'm kind of trying to look at this from a different approach. If the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10614)|
| 2:57:02| doesn't pass and it goes, it goes back, you can technically build five, 10 different buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10622)|
| 2:57:09| on this property and still house all the men on the property. The difference is that you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10629)|
| 2:57:17| won't have staff, supervisory staff in each of those houses. Is that correct? Because right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10637)|
| 2:57:27| you're going for 12 plus the two staff in the one house? Yes, Commissioner. So what, what this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10647)|
| 2:57:36| do as agricultural with a boarding house use is it would cap the number of occupants and would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10656)|
| 2:57:43| also provide for common area inside the building. So you would have areas where people could gather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10663)|
| 2:57:50| you know, put a pool table or a large gathering spot. And then we're also going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| apartment there where staff will live full time. So if you go PR and you build conventional houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10675)|
| 2:58:01| or apartments, then you'll have these men living in separate, they'll have to be in separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10681)|
| 2:58:06| dwellings. We'd have to have a certain number of kitchens. It would be more like an apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10686)|
| 2:58:11| complex or a subdivision there than a, than a group home. And the reason that we're, the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10691)|
| 2:58:21| that we're doing group home or, or boarding houses, MPC has group home definition, but Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10701)|
| 2:58:28| doesn't have a group home definition. So just like there's no definition for halfway house. So there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10708)|
| 2:58:36| in this process of, and this, and this need that's in the community, there's not a clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10716)|
| 2:58:42| there's not clear definitions. And so that's one of the reasons why it's kind of confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10722)|
| 2:58:48| My question kind of goes towards the staffing part. I feel better having restriction with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10728)|
| 2:58:56| with staff supervision, then no restriction. So you can have 20, 30 guys there and no staff to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10736)|
| 2:59:04| supervise them. That's kind of where my, I'm trying to look at it from a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10744)|
| 2:59:09| Is it better to have all 12 under the same roof with staff there with them to supervise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10749)|
| 2:59:14| or is it better to let it go back to PR and then you have 20, 30 guys, but there isn't the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10754)|
| 2:59:21| to, cause you can't have 20, 30 staff there to watch each group of four guys kind of thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10761)|
| 2:59:27| what I'm kind of getting at. Is that accurate or am I, am I going down the wrong path here on my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10767)|
| 2:59:33| my thinking on this? I think you're right. And I think that's, that's why we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| we're wanting to do this the way we are. In reality, when we look back through this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10777)|
| 2:59:42| we talk with County codes, you're allowed to have six people in each residence. I mean, so it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10782)|
| 2:59:50| the numbers start going through the roof and I'm not take this. There's no way that we would ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10790)|
| 2:59:55| want to do that, but we've, we've tried to be open and upfront and talking about the use from day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10795)|
| 3:00:01| one. It was not, Hey, we're going to rezone this. And then talk about the use later from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10801)|
| 3:00:06| we have said, this is what we want to do. This is why we're doing it. And we're going to limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| the men that will be, there will be limited and there'll be a staff there full time. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10811)|
| 3:00:18| that's that looking back on it now, the board, you know, we, we discuss it and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10818)|
| 3:00:24| Parker, it wouldn't have been easier to just build an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| The answer is yes, but it's, it's not also top telling the community we want to be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10827)|
| 3:00:33| neighbor. And so you're absolutely right. That this limits the number of men that would be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| and it, and it puts staff in the building with them. Okay. That's what I was trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10838)|

| 3:01:06| that you will still build homes or apartments. If that were to occur, talk to me about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10866)|
| 3:01:17| I know you wouldn't have a requirement for supervision, but, but just what would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10877)|

| 3:01:29| is if that's the case, then we would probably put staff in one of the apartments or we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10889)|
| 3:01:34| build a house that's, that's just for staff. We're in a unique position at Angelic where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10894)|
| 3:01:39| some of our donators and some of the people that support us are home builders. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| you know, well-known builders here in town. If y'all know anything about the Frasers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10904)|
| 3:01:50| Knoxville salvage, we have the ability to get building materials at a, at a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10910)|
| 3:01:55| inexpensive rate. So we have the ability to, to one, get this project done and get this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10915)|
| 3:02:03| operational, but if not, then to go, to go the other, to go the other route of doing apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10923)|
| 3:02:09| and that sort of thing. I will say this. It, it matters a lot with what BZA says, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10929)|
| 3:02:17| they'll be in, in the PR zone. We would still have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| MPC approval of PR, and that would be open for an appeal. And so the opposition could file an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10941)|
| 3:02:27| appeal. So, you know, it just because it doesn't get rezoned does not mean that, you know, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10947)|
| 3:02:36| do what we're looking, what we're looking to do. It would just be another fight. Or, so, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10956)|
| 3:02:42| that's, I'm trying to be as honest and upfront as I can be to explain the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10962)|
| 3:02:48| I know you have, and I appreciate that, and you certainly have. And I'm sure Angelic Ministries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10968)|

| 3:03:11| Yes, ma'am. And I think that's, that's why this rezoning, we're talking about use, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10991)|
| 3:03:17| because we're trying to be as open as we can on this. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=10997)|
| 3:03:24| Chairman Jay. This question is for Law Director Sanders. I'm looking at the BZA agenda for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11004)|

| 3:03:39| If, in fact, this was changed to agricultural, how would that affect that meeting, and what if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11019)|
| 3:03:48| wasn't, and if it was denied here? I kind of, I'm going, I guess what I'm getting at is I kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11028)|
| 3:03:55| follow Commissioner Daly's conversation about that really, this should have gone to BZA first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11035)|
| 3:04:03| instead of County Commission. But, well, I suppose that if, you know, there are two options tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11043)|
| 3:04:13| either the County Commission approves the rezoning to agricultural or denies it and it remains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11053)|
| 3:04:20| planned residential. If the first option happens, the use on review approval can move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11060)|
| 3:04:30| and, you know, it will be up to the Board of Zoning Appeals to determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11070)|
| 3:04:36| the development plan meets all the requirements of the zoning ordinance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11076)|
| 3:04:41| this, you know, can be approved and then a building permit can issue. If the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11081)|
| 3:04:47| denies this request for rezoning, it would be unlikely that the Board of Zoning Appeals would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11087)|
| 3:04:54| approve the use on review knowing that that had happened. It wouldn't be consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11094)|
| 3:05:02| zoning ordinance, and a denial today would be an indication that there wouldn't be some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11102)|
| 3:05:10| forthcoming rezoning that the use on review could be contingent on. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11110)|
| 3:05:22| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Sanders. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11122)|
| 3:05:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I first have a question for the applicant, and then I have a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11129)|
| 3:05:36| our EPW director, Jim Snowden. For the applicant, looking at this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11136)|
| 3:05:43| whenever I drove up to it, I did not realize it had a basement underneath it. I do see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11143)|
| 3:05:51| using Google Maps, that there are a set of steps that go down to what is probably a basement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11151)|
| 3:05:58| but I would assume that this basement is completely underground with no windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11158)|
| 3:06:03| Is that correct, sir? No, it daylights out on the front side. So on three sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11163)|
| 3:06:09| well, actually on two sides, I'm sorry. On two sides, it is underground, and then on the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11169)|
| 3:06:15| side, it daylights, and on the front of the building, it daylights. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11175)|
| 3:06:26| How much daylight does it have? I mean, what size openings does it have for egress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11186)|
| 3:06:31| On the north side, I would say 80% of the building is daylighted, and on the front side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11191)|
| 3:06:38| I think it's close to the same amount. There's a lot of exposed basement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11198)|
| 3:06:53| Mr. Snowden? And what I'm looking at is the potential for expansion later down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11213)|
| 3:06:59| here. Am I still correct in my assumption that all bedrooms have to have an egress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11219)|
| 3:07:08| so that would eliminate most of this basement? That's correct. Yeah, you have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11228)|
| 3:07:16| an egress route for a bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11236)|

| 3:07:35| if we tear this down tonight to agricultural, for they have some type of control as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11255)|
| 3:07:42| they can go in and make that building into an apartment. And I don't know how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11262)|
| 3:07:49| rooms that apartment can be or would be. That would be up to, I guess, the use on review when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11269)|
| 3:07:55| they come for the concept plan and everything. And then they will be able to build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11275)|
| 3:08:00| It's just according to what the concept plan is. So, thinking outside the box, like Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11280)|
| 3:08:06| Ward says, at least there would be some type of control if we go to agricultural. If we do not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11286)|
| 3:08:13| to agricultural, they can go to PR, they can do an apartment, and they could add extra buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11293)|
| 3:08:18| on to it, too. So, it's really up to us to vote on what feels the best. So, I just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11298)|
| 3:08:28| that clear that, you know, I think we're better off by going to agricultural. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210125?start=11308)|
