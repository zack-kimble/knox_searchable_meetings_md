| 2:37:10| There has been some development on the corridors and is to use your words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9430)|
| 2:37:15| Now, I think it's a good time to double down on the process that we've already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9435)|
| 2:37:21| So I just wanted to make sure that I wanted to acknowledge some of the stuff that we've already done. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| Thank you. Council member Hussie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| Ditto to the corridors. Thank you all. I'd like to nominate Chapman Highway if we're taking nominations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9450)|
| 2:37:37| We need it bad. I'm too serious. OK, so as in my former life, it seems like all my colleagues have a microphone and you all pretty much covered all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9457)|
| 2:37:48| I do. I'd like to double down on tracking on data tracking. And is there. And I've talked to Cheryl a couple of times about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9468)|
| 2:37:55| Excuse me, Miss Ball. Is there any way we can put this on the city's Web site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| So just citizens can look to see in their neighborhood what's happening or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9479)|
| 2:38:05| Yeah, thanks to our recent contracts with the Vero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| We're hoping to have more dashboards and visibility for permits and and for other types of reviews that are happening and maps and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9490)|
| 2:38:20| We we have we I think are going to have much greater capacity to do that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9500)|
| 2:38:25| Thanks to these recent investments in software where we haven't been a little bit behind on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9505)|
| 2:38:31| I think, you know, the planning commission has, you know, has some great maps and KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9511)|
| 2:38:37| But just knowing being able to look in particular at at your neighborhood and finding out what's happened at a particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9517)|
| 2:38:43| You know, we'd like to improve that for sure. Thank you. Perfect. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9523)|
| 2:38:49| Council member writer. Yeah, I just wanted to follow up on something that was said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9529)|
| 2:38:58| And just kind of in closing, if nothing else comes up. But there was a comment about we've had a cultural shift and more people wanting to live alone than in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9538)|
| 2:39:10| We have more single and there's a lot of data and we've talked about in the workshops and stuff about how more people live alone than they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9550)|
| 2:39:18| Like, for example, you know, my house has four people in it, but it was built by a family that had 11 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9558)|
| 2:39:25| So I think a lot of them were in the same bedrooms, but because there aren't that many bedrooms, but it just is significantly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9565)|
| 2:39:33| And I just wanted to cite this. And I know it's hard to visualize without actually looking at it, me reading it aloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9573)|
| 2:39:40| But one of the architects and neighbors in Forth and Gill, when we had a discussion there, did an analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9580)|
| 2:39:48| So like just looking at one block in Forth and Gill in 1910, which is kind of like one of the heights of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9588)|
| 2:39:56| On that particular block is an analysis from the census data. There were 13 houses on the block, 13 units of dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9596)|
| 2:40:04| OK, 67 residents there. So that would be all the people that occupied those houses from the census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9604)|
| 2:40:12| 67 people, 13 houses, 13 units. In 1950, post-World War II, when the neighborhood was kind of at the height of division of houses, renting out rooms, that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9612)|
| 2:40:26| the same 13 houses, because one was lost, was 12 houses, 27 units of dwelling units with 100 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9626)|
| 2:40:36| So the block went from 67 residents to 100 residents in that 40 year span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| People used to, you know, enclose the porches, take a door and make the door the division between one unit and the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9642)|
| 2:40:51| which is not allowed by current modern code. So that's how you get the 27 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9651)|
| 2:40:57| Today, the 2023 numbers from the most recent census, 29 residents on that same block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9657)|
| 2:41:06| So it went from 67 to a high of 100, down to 29 residents, 15 units, so there's still some subdivisions there, and 11 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9666)|
| 2:41:15| So we used to have 13 houses. Now it's just 11. But with two less houses, you have just 15 units and 29 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9675)|
| 2:41:24| So there's just a lot more people living with a lot less people in the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| And that, I only share that with you to just kind of illustrate where we have changed as a culture, as Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9688)|
| 2:41:36| You know, we don't want our parents to per se move in with us. We want them to live in the carriage house or the other unit next to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9696)|
| 2:41:45| I know a lot of people, you know, the parents might live in a house near them, but not necessarily in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| And I used to tease my mom and my dad, you know, because I have a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| I was like, well, mom, dad, you guys can each live in one side of it. And they actually hated each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| They've been divorced since I was two and a half, and my dad is no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| So it was really fun to razz them that way, that I would put them, that would be their old folks home, put them side by side together again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9723)|
| 2:42:10| But anyway, it's just how we live today. People are in their dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9730)|
| 2:42:16| So I thought it was important data to look at. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| Okay. Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=9740)|

| 2:46:44| Good evening. I come before you with a sense of urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10004)|
| 2:46:49| What I'm asking is doable, for it has been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| The former administration was bold and caring enough to move when the youth of this city were dying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| in large numbers that grew too large to no longer be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10018)|
| 2:47:03| Space and money was provided for change, for refuge and for restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10023)|
| 2:47:08| to reduce violent related deaths. Now we need that same help again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10028)|
| 2:47:14| For unhoused related deaths. The cry has risen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10034)|
| 2:47:20| For many have continuously died in the streets of Knoxville, especially in 2023 and already in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10040)|
| 2:47:27| But for the caring hearts of many, hundreds would have died in these last ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10047)|
| 2:47:33| We still have lost seven that we know of. And more will be found as the snow melts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10053)|
| 2:47:40| More like Miss Linda found frozen to death on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| And Mr. Solomon found dead in a churchyard yesterday, frozen to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10064)|
| 2:47:49| But it doesn't have to be that way going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| We ask that you be bold and courageous enough, like our past mayor and councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| to rise up in this right now moment and step into your humanness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10078)|
| 2:48:04| away from political party and personal goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10084)|
| 2:48:08| Within the coffers of Knoxville storehouses lie millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10088)|

| 2:48:53| We have many buildings standing vacant, buildings that should be given so that the hundreds of the most vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10133)|

| 2:49:08| It was the first opportunity in years to sleep with both eyes closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10148)|
| 2:49:13| to sleep on clean linens, to be shown unconditional love, cared for and not judged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10153)|

| 2:49:32| That charge is still the same. You are the shepherds of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10172)|

| 2:50:37| Rick Roach, Knoxville. Thank you, Vivian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10237)|
| 2:50:48| Ninety three blizzard thing, I worked out in Alcoa and I went back and forth to work in Alcoa, up and down, over the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10248)|
| 2:50:59| No problem. We had a city of Knoxville response that handled the situation and it was rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10259)|
| 2:51:13| I don't normally believe in optics. I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10273)|
| 2:51:20| Sometimes it's better just to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10280)|
| 2:51:27| Because that gives people hope. And that makes people feel like somebody really does care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10287)|
| 2:51:34| And, you know, I put a lot of value on that. I was disappointed, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10294)|
| 2:51:42| I know you had previously scheduled all this and functions and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10302)|
| 2:51:48| And in your mind, it was very important that you be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| But your primary function should have been to be present with the people that you have per view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10314)|
| 2:52:07| That being said. Another thing I'm going to finish up on what I had spoken to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10327)|
| 2:52:16| I've repeatedly kind of given the same message over and over again over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10336)|
| 2:52:23| And that's based on what I personally have experienced and what I've seen other people experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10343)|
| 2:52:31| And you cannot deny the results of what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10351)|
| 2:52:38| In particular areas of Knoxville, because you have got the proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10358)|
| 2:52:45| You have got the proof. You have got the proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10365)|
| 2:52:55| And so it makes me wonder what I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10375)|
| 2:53:01| I had a discussion with one of the council members here about what I was referencing and hinting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10381)|
| 2:53:12| And they were kind of upset because I was talking about what's in someone's heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10392)|
| 2:53:19| And believe me, I am no saint. I'm old dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10399)|
| 2:53:25| I've done a lot of stuff. OK, so it's not about judgment, only in the sense of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10405)|
| 2:53:37| Caring. OK, caring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| So I know people out here right now. I didn't know Linda Shropshire, but I knew her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10423)|
| 2:53:55| I gave her rides. She would cuss me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10435)|
| 2:54:05| But she was in need. So, like I said, I go up and down Broadway every day and I see it and it does have an effect on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10445)|
| 2:54:18| And so I don't have a lot of time for the BS. I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10458)|
| 2:54:25| It makes me wonder what is it that I can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| What is it that you all who control resources can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10470)|
| 2:54:39| And so I find community workers, I find police, I find fire department folk stressed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10479)|
| 2:54:51| A lot of stress. I find fire department people, they can't respond to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10491)|
| 2:55:01| So when you find people from dying from I don't care, I don't care what drug she was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10501)|
| 2:55:09| I don't. The fact that she 25 years out here in in in in in the elements, 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10509)|
| 2:55:18| That's how long I've known about her presence. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10518)|
| 2:55:24| And that's a lost soul. And we all are collectively responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10524)|
| 2:55:31| Whether we want to or not. And what I said to Mayor Haslam back then, 10 year plan, I'll say it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10531)|
| 2:55:37| And I'll ask the question, biblical scripture. Am I my brother and sister's keeper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10537)|
| 2:55:44| And y'all need to seriously think hard about answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10544)|
| 2:55:49| Thank you. And the next person signed up for public forum is Stephen White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10549)|
| 2:55:54| Stephen White, are you present? No. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10554)|
| 2:55:59| Next person is Tom Ruggles. Mr. Ruggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10559)|
| 2:56:08| Tom Ruggles, Knoxville, District two, speaking on behalf of myself this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10568)|
| 2:56:14| I got sort of a list of a few different things, but I'll start with what Rick Roach and Miss Shite brought up about folks who have unfortunately froze to death over the past few days here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10574)|
| 2:56:28| At the beginning of our session here today in the mayor's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10588)|
| 2:56:33| it was mentioned that there were 120 people in the shelters the first night and a bit over 200 in the subsequent nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10593)|
| 2:56:42| And so, you know, it's great that we were able to put together a few warming centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10602)|
| 2:56:47| I believe there were three and that we were able to get 200 folks a warm place to sleep for a couple of night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10607)|
| 2:56:56| But there are twelve hundred unhoused people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| And so clearly the infrastructure is not there to allow beds for all of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10620)|
| 2:57:07| The vast majority of these folks are sort of in the Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10627)|
| 2:57:11| These three warming centers, they were not near that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| although I do acknowledge the need for them to be on the east side and the south side and the west side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10635)|
| 2:57:22| So I hope in the future we will allow some of our copious public safety money towards keeping members of our public safe, particularly those who are the most vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10642)|
| 2:57:38| Let's see, the second thing on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10658)|
| 2:57:42| I was just looking at some numbers earlier with our affordable housing crisis and was just thinking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10662)|
| 2:57:50| we hear all the time about, you know, the government acting as a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10670)|
| 2:57:57| And, you know, we've elected presidents in this country under the idea that good business equals good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10677)|
| 2:58:03| And so I wonder why our government isn't looking into getting into the business of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10683)|
| 2:58:11| For example, I was looking at how much it costs to build an apartment complex and said, you know, about $120 to about $450 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10691)|
| 2:58:23| So if we say it costs about $300 a square foot, you could build a thousand units for $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10703)|
| 2:58:32| And we could own that as a city, as a people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| And I know that sounds like a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| Wow, $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10717)|
| 2:58:40| But it is not unprecedented to spend that kind of money here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10720)|
| 2:58:45| Right now, actually, we're spending $70 million on the new public safety complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10725)|
| 2:58:50| and that's something that we're not going to get a return on investment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10730)|
| 2:58:55| And so say we build this $200 million, 1,000-unit apartment complex or series of complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10735)|
| 2:59:05| What would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10745)|
| 2:59:06| Over 20 years, we could rent out those as one-bedroom units at the same price as the ones we mentioned earlier today at $765 a month for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10746)|
| 2:59:20| and pay off that entire $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| And so, you know, I wonder maybe it makes sense of us actually getting into the business of building these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10763)|
| 2:59:30| rather than subsidizing for-profit companies to build them for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10770)|
| 2:59:38| And that way, we could also have this competitive force in the market of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10778)|
| 2:59:43| having these thousand units that are cheaper that would force the businesses to sort of lower their rents in order to compete with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10783)|
| 2:59:52| Okay, I still got a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| With my last minute here, I just wanted to mention the list of cities that have passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire to the genocide going on in Gaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10794)|
| 3:00:08| which this body refused to even second on November 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10808)|
| 3:00:14| And hopefully, maybe we can reconsider now that we have at least one new face on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10814)|
| 3:00:21| Those cities are San Francisco, Oakland, Atlanta, Detroit, Akron, Albany, Providence, and as of today or I think last night, Minneapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10821)|
| 3:00:34| And so, this is a trend happening in many cities in a way that we can show solidarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10834)|
| 3:00:40| and our opposition to the genocide and the atrocities that are going on to the Palestinian folks in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10840)|
| 3:00:49| So, perhaps this body will reconsider, rehear, and vote that forward in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10849)|
| 3:00:55| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| Thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10857)|
| 3:00:58| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| And without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10860)|
| 3:01:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240123?start=10865)|
