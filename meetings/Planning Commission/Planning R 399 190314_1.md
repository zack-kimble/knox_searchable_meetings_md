| 2:46:14| Otherwise, we would be speculating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| So with the mixed-use special district, it does come back before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9977)|
| 2:46:21| No, it would not come back before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| If it's rezoned, the proposed use would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9984)|
| 2:46:27| With the C6 zoning, the development of the C6 property is subject to site plan review by staff, but not by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9987)|
| 2:46:35| Okay. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9995)|
| 2:46:38| Yeah, I was going to ask Josh about this track is 36 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=9998)|
| 2:46:45| Now, does the truck stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| Why are you requesting rezoning on the front six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| Couldn't you put it on the back or on the middle part of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| Estes, when they contacted us, one of the requirements of the contract was for us to zone the entire parcel for one tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10016)|
| 2:47:03| for them to use it as I3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| I would love to stand here and say, let's leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| It should be parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| I just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| That's above my pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| I can't answer that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10033)|
| 2:47:14| We also have soil studies that will be done after the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10034)|
| 2:47:18| So what we don't want to get into is if we hit, or they, Estes hits bad, unsuitable soil somewhere on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10038)|
| 2:47:25| and they can't shift or do something with the I3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| But, again, the goal, and when we laid it out for FedEx, then we laid it out for UPS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10048)|
| 2:47:33| and then Estes laid it out again, parking for the automobiles and the employees makes 100% sense for the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10053)|
| 2:47:43| And I guess that was news to me, that C6, you could have the parking along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10063)|
| 2:47:49| I don't want to get into leaving it like this because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10069)|
| 2:47:58| I can't speak for Estes as the end user,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| and I don't know if they can answer that at their time without unsuitable soil studies being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10081)|
| 2:48:07| How much land do they need for their use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| I'd love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10091)|
| 2:48:12| I mean, have they put a contract on the whole track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| Yeah, they're buying everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10094)|
| 2:48:15| So it would be one tenant, one everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| So what you're going to get is you're going to get Estes in the middle of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| and they're not cutting anything off, so it will be their property and they're not in commercial or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| So you're going to get rid of the frontage, use it for parking, and then you'll have the industrial in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10105)|
| 2:48:31| That's the perfect world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10111)|
| 2:48:32| That's the perfect scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| I mean, the only fear, I guess, is if we did rezone it from C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| and then they for some reason changed their mind or walked on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| and then you've got I-3 sitting there for, I don't know, I guess another truck stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10121)|
| 2:48:49| That is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| Again, the facts are there will be a truck stop there on that I-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10132)|
| 2:48:59| whether we rezone this six acres on the front of it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| We bought that for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10142)|
| 2:49:03| It's very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10143)|
| 2:49:04| I-3, the strawberry plant's exit, is made for trucking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10144)|
| 2:49:08| I mean, Pilot doesn't go on and put truck stops just on random exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10148)|
| 2:49:12| This is a truck stop exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| So this will be a truck stop on this property at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| Could we have truck stop on the front and then additional commercial on the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| Yeah, but I've had a for sale sign on it since day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| and no Publix or Walmart or grocery stores called us to buy anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| We're not commercial developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10170)|
| 2:49:31| We're not retail people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| We don't even know what the vision of commercial in this town looks like in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10173)|
| 2:49:37| We've got multiple properties that have lots of great frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| and we'd love to say, oh, here's a nice retail spot or here's a nice bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| We don't know what the commercial real estate market is in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| There are more trucks today on the road, and they're making more every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| UPS, FedEx, Amazon is only getting bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| Trucking is only getting more and more important to this economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10195)|
| 2:49:58| This right here, don't rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10198)|
| 2:50:01| I don't know if Estes packs up and leaves or they're going to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| Right now, if you rezone it, Estes is the only condition of our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10204)|
| 2:50:09| They're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| They're bringing more jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10210)|
| 2:50:11| It's going to be instant tax base for the city, and we put this one to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10211)|
| 2:50:17| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10217)|
| 2:50:25| I just want to share, as I shared the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| I can't think of many more intensive uses than a trucking terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10227)|
| 2:50:33| And I would much rather have we're not going to stop them from putting a trucking terminal on that I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10233)|
| 2:50:39| What we can do is have an appropriate buffer, as much as we can decide, on the front six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10239)|
| 2:50:47| And I would just highly recommend, you know, you don't have to look far to see the effects of a use like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10247)|
| 2:50:54| You can go to Sutherland Avenue and look at AAA Cooper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10254)|
| 2:50:58| who has trailers backed up to Sutherland Avenue within 25 feet of the road, and it's just an inappropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10258)|
| 2:51:05| It's likely going to be around the clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| and we can minimize the impact of the I-3 around the neighbors if we just simply do not rezone the C-6 to I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10269)|
| 2:51:18| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| That is a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10282)|
| 2:51:23| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10283)|
| 2:51:26| and I heard Commissioner Crowder do a second on that to deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10286)|
| 2:51:33| I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10296)|

| 2:52:40| Madam Chair, 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10360)|
| 2:52:45| Was the East County sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10365)|
| 2:52:50| You just did the rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10370)|
| 2:52:51| Do we need to address the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10371)|

| 2:53:18| I believe there was one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10401)|

| 2:54:18| Mr. Huber, would you like to go first or the opposition will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| So I get the ball first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10466)|
| 2:54:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10470)|
| 2:54:31| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10471)|
| 2:54:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10472)|
| 2:54:33| My name is Craig Swenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| I live at 10702 Deepwoods Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| I appreciate you all volunteering your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| First off, this has been very enlightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| I kind of enjoyed my day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| I've learned a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| So I don't oppose totally everything that Mr. Huber is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| What I have a problem with is I've lived on this road since the plane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10496)|
| 2:54:59| went into the Twin Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| I was inspecting my roof that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| So I've lived there quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| I've seen plenty of accidents on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10505)|
| 2:55:08| I've talked to Mr. Snowden multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10508)|
| 2:55:11| He put a Band-Aid on a bullet wound and fixed the intersection of woody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| and thought he had this cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| Now I hear there's a $10 million project to fix Canton Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10516)|
| 2:55:20| Well, the traffic on Canton Hollow is very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| On Emory Church Road you have a plan now to build a whole bunch of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| There's a subdivision going in on Canton Hollow right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10529)|
| 2:55:34| from where he's proposing to build his duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10534)|
| 2:55:39| My problem is I don't think you should put any more in the bag until you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10539)|
| 2:55:43| can see if the bag can hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| The traffic is really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10545)|
| 2:55:46| We've had deaths on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| Now you're going to straighten the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| The traffic is getting faster, quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| And I know listening to Mr. Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| he kind of discounted the appeal to the public about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| This is a very bad road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| I've been told this is one of the worst roads in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| I don't think we should discount this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| Even Mr. Huber said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| I was waiting for Mr. Snowden to make a move and get this fixed before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10568)|
| 2:56:12| began developing because I was concerned about how much fill and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| everything I would have to bring in to make it safe for my occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| Pulling out at 5 o'clock in the morning, I go to the gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| I take a very deadly left-hand turn because I have a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10584)|
| 2:56:30| Nothing's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| What I'm going to ask the commission to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| I believe that he has a right to build on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10594)|
| 2:56:38| I'm not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10598)|
| 2:56:39| But what I would ask the commission to do is to just slow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| Until the road is corrected and everybody can drive safely on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| don't build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| He's been waiting how long to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| Two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| I know when Mr. Snowden said he was going to fix it, my dad was still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10613)|
| 2:56:57| He's been dead two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10617)|
| 2:56:58| So that's how long we've been waiting for this road to get corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10618)|
| 2:57:02| I don't think we should do anything more until you see the impact of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10622)|
| 2:57:06| you've already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| Those apartments are not filled up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| They're not even finished in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| The lots, the housing across the street from where he's building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| they've not even completed all the building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10635)|
| 2:57:19| Seven o'clock in the morning, the kids go to school, it's risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| You've got people cutting around the school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| I don't think you're ready yet to put more in the sack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| I think you just need to slow it down and see what you do with the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10650)|
| 2:57:34| I'm hopeful that Mr. Snowden puts enough curves in the road to keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| traffic slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| But right now, it's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10667)|
| 2:57:51| John Huber, PO Box 23038, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10671)|
| 2:57:56| Yeah, I bought this property a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10676)|
| 2:57:58| and we subdivided it into four lots sometime early last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| and decided to go ahead and move forward with some duplexes on the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| From a conformity perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| there's actually medium density to the right of it and the left of it on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10688)|
| 2:58:12| same road as it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| Just as he had mentioned, there's a brand new subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| Saddlebrook is building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| They're finishing it out right now directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10699)|
| 2:58:22| So, I mean, there's that going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| You know, he mentioned the apartment complex over on Emory Church Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| which I have a little bit of knowledge about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| You know, the traffic study that was done on that project showed about 80| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| to 90% of the traffic from that complex going directly over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10718)|
| 2:58:43| Westland Drive and then entering on Pellissippi Parkway right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| There was very, very little that went down the Fox Road corridor and towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10727)|
| 2:58:52| Kent Hollow Road where we're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| So, I really don't think that's much of an impact here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| You know, the way I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| Knox County does have a major road improvement coming through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10740)|
| 2:59:05| I don't want to speak for Knox County, but I think it's even been appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| But it's going to be a Class A road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| It's going to be wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10751)|
| 2:59:12| The way I understand it, again, is they've got a walking trail on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10752)|
| 2:59:15| and a sidewalk on the other side, curb and gutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| They're going to flatten a lot of the hills that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| straighten out the dangerous curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10762)|
| 2:59:23| I know they've heard a lot of these stories, and that's in process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10763)|
| 2:59:29| Could we hear from Knox County Engineering a little bit more about any kind of time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10769)|
| 2:59:36| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10776)|
| 2:59:37| Mr. Snowden, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10777)|
| 2:59:38| Yeah, I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| And I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10779)|
| 2:59:40| Sometimes our processes do take longer than even we would like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| But to acquire property and design a road of this substance, it does take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10783)|
| 2:59:49| We are in the right-of-way acquisition phase on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| The project is completely designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| and we're probably about 30 to 40 percent complete with right-of-way acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10794)|
| 2:59:59| There's about 90 tracts of land we have to acquire, including two relocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10799)|
| 3:00:04| So that does take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10804)|
| 3:00:07| We will be fully funded with the project for construction July 1 of this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10807)|
| 3:00:15| And our anticipated start date for construction is early spring of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| So this time next year you will see dirt being turned and an improvement made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10819)|
| 3:00:26| And I know the gentleman had mentioned the site distance there at that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10826)|
| 3:00:31| That particular hill we're going to be lowering by about five feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| and installing a retaining wall near that church as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| so that anybody pulling out of those locations will have much safer site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| And we are widening the lanes to 11-foot lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| Right now they're about nine feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| So when we do get done, hopefully probably 18 months to two years from next spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10849)|
| 3:00:57| So that's, let's see, spring of 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10857)|
| 3:01:00| Spring of 2022, this roadway should be complete, open to traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10860)|
| 3:01:05| and it does include everything from Kingston Pike to Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| So I'll be happy to answer any more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| but that's just some general details in regard to the project and the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| Thank you. Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10876)|
| 3:01:20| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan for the up to four duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10880)|
| 3:01:25| on individual lots for a total of eight dwelling units subject to the five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10885)|
| 3:01:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10890)|
| 3:01:31| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10891)|
| 3:01:36| I do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10896)|
| 3:01:39| Sir, do you have something really quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10899)|
| 3:01:42| One more thing I admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| Sorry, I'm not used to speaking in public, and I get sometimes scattered by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10904)|
| 3:01:48| So one of the things you brought up earlier today was about a signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| posting of a sign to inform the public that rezoning is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10912)|
| 3:01:57| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10917)|
| 3:01:58| I think your signs need to be a lot bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| They're very hard to see, and they're kind of set back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| His, I spotted, but I actually had to walk down there to figure out what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| I went on vacation, and I got this little card in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10928)|
| 3:02:12| I went to my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10932)|
| 3:02:13| I said, hey, did you get one of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| My neighbors didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| So I ended up here today on the spur of the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| I came back from vacation, had this card in the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| I took a picture, sent it to my neighbor, who backs up to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10942)|
| 3:02:25| Never got one of these cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| I would suggest first Mr. Huber was kind enough to show me the plans of the project he's supposed to be building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10947)|
| 3:02:33| Looked very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| I would say mail some more information out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| Give them in a closed envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| This thing can get stuck in a mail flyer or anything else and get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| It's important to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| You're changing the potential value of my home, everything I've worked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| It's important we get notified properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| This little card ain't it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| And an enclosed envelope could also get included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| Exactly, but at least it looks more presentable than a postcard that, you know, half my neighbors didn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10978)|
| 3:03:05| Or a website where I can go and say, hey, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| The postcard has the website with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| There is some responsibility for the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10993)|
| 3:03:16| And I'll defend my staff and the procedures we used for notifying the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=10996)|
| 3:03:21| As I've said numerous times, this is a participatory sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11001)|
| 3:03:25| Democracy is a participatory sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11008)|
| 3:03:29| And we have a website, a very good website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| We post information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11012)|
| 3:03:33| We're available many hours of every day and evenings to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11013)|
| 3:03:38| No offense was met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11020)|
| 3:03:41| We do have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11021)|
| 3:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11022)|
| 3:03:43| We appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11023)|
| 3:03:44| We do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| It was a motion by Commissioner Clancy and a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11026)|
| 3:03:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11034)|
| 3:03:57| No other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11037)|
| 3:03:58| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11040)|
| 3:04:01| Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11041)|
| 3:04:02| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11042)|
| 3:04:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11043)|
| 3:04:08| We are on to agenda item number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11048)|
| 3:04:17| The applicant is PRI of East Tennessee, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11057)|
| 3:04:22| The location is the west side of South National Drive, south of Asbury Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11062)|
| 3:04:28| The approximate size of the tract is 8.44 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11068)|
| 3:04:33| The zoning is I, industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11073)|
| 3:04:36| The existing land use is office slash business use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11076)|
| 3:04:41| Proposed use is an asphalt plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| The staff recommendation is to approve the asphalt plant with a maximum capacity of 200 tons per hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11084)|
| 3:04:51| as shown on the development plan, subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11091)|
| 3:04:55| And before we go forward, we'd like to hear from Mr. Reynolds, who will talk about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11095)|
| 3:05:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| I guess we didn't get a chance to talk about this one at our agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11103)|
| 3:05:06| I just wanted to give everybody a quick overview of what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11106)|
| 3:05:10| Asphalt plants aren't something that we review on a daily basis, so it's a little bit harder for not only staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11110)|
| 3:05:15| but I imagine the commission to understand what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11115)|
| 3:05:19| I'm probably going to have to, you know, I don't know a bunch about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11119)|
| 3:05:23| but I'm going to try my best to step you through this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| So the property itself has been in zone industrial for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11127)|
| 3:05:31| This is a river industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| It has been used where they want to put the asphalt plants on the backside of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11133)|
| 3:05:39| It's been used as parking for a long time for a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11139)|
| 3:05:42| It has been graded and has gravel back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11142)|
| 3:05:46| That part of it won't change too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| The 200 ton per hour capacity that they have is about as small as I saw from manufacturers of this type of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11149)|
| 3:06:00| Once you get smaller than this, then you're talking about like the mobile type that you would start seeing crop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11160)|
| 3:06:05| again, on a large project like an interstate or something like that where they need to have asphalt closer to hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11165)|
| 3:06:15| The industrial zone, which is the heaviest zone that the county has, does list asphalt plants as a use permit and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11175)|
| 3:06:23| What that means is they're not allowed to do it unless the planning commission says it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11183)|
| 3:06:29| There's different criteria that we look at for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11189)|
| 3:06:33| There's a character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| Is this in character with the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11195)|
| 3:06:38| How is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| Does it diminish value of adjacent properties or significantly injure them in some way and so on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11200)|
| 3:06:50| The other part of the industrial zone for the use and review is that there is a 300 foot setback from any residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11210)|
| 3:06:59| park, church, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| There's some other uses that are listed, but that's not specific to asphalt plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11221)|
| 3:07:06| That's specific to any use that is a use permit and review in the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11226)|
| 3:07:11| The original plan for this asphalt plant had three silos that were proposed today and three future silos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11231)|
| 3:07:18| which is where the asphalt gets stored until it gets dumped onto the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11238)|
| 3:07:23| That takes it off site and then onto the paving project, whatever it's going to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| One of those future silos was actually within 300 feet of a residentially zoned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11248)|
| 3:07:35| or agriculture is also considered a residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11255)|
| 3:07:41| You can tell how close this facility is in regard to our minimum 300 foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11261)|
| 3:07:48| The current facility does meet the setback, so that's not a problem from a zoning standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11268)|
| 3:07:54| I think the bigger issue that we deal with is while we can help affect visual issues with conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11274)|
| 3:08:08| such as putting up landscape screenings or making sure that lights that might be in the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11288)|
| 3:08:13| get pointed away from residential properties and that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11293)|
| 3:08:16| we really can't do much about any other types of things that might be happening in a facility like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11296)|
| 3:08:21| whether it's noise or smells, odors, everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11301)|
| 3:08:27| We just can't affect it by putting up landscape screenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| The only really effective method is further away, having them in a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11310)|
| 3:08:36| In the end, staff felt that because of the location, it is an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11316)|
| 3:08:42| it meets the setback with the conditions that we're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11322)|
| 3:08:46| We felt that this facility was still an appropriate use for this particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11326)|
| 3:08:55| One of the conditions we have in there is to install a landscape screening along the edge of the residential properties to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11335)|
| 3:09:04| Hoping that that can provide some visual screening sometime in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| If I'll take any questions, if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11349)|
| 3:09:15| Stand by, I'm sure there's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11357)|
| 3:09:19| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11359)|
| 3:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| Sir, do you want to go first to the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| Madam Chair, Commissioners, my name is Greg Elschei, 6434 Owens Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11368)|
| 3:09:36| We purchased the property at 5651 South National Drive in January 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11376)|
| 3:09:43| for the purpose of our growing business and the industrial zone classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11383)|
| 3:09:49| PRI of East Tennessee started in 2008 with myself and one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11389)|
| 3:09:53| I'm happy to say that one employee is still with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11393)|
| 3:09:57| We have over 90 employees at this location today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11397)|
| 3:10:01| We have obtained our Knox County air quality construction permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11401)|
| 3:10:06| We meet all the zoning requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11406)|
| 3:10:09| We respectfully ask that Planning Commission approve the staff's recommendation for approval of our new asphalt plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11409)|
| 3:10:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11415)|
| 3:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| You still have four minutes if you want to use them later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11426)|

| 3:10:31| I represent the residents of the Asbury community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| Many of them are represented in the petition that you should have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| You should also have a letter that I submitted concerning this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11437)|
| 3:10:41| Our community is comprised of two churches, one of which was built in 1898| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| and is on the National Historic Register of Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| There are 15 houses within 1,000 feet of the proposed plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| and five houses that are within 1,700 feet of the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11452)|
| 3:10:55| Several houses are closing in on the century mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| and they're characterized by the architecture of the early part of the 20th century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| As a community, we value our time that we spend outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11462)|
| 3:11:06| Asbury United Methodist Church has a community playground that many of the community kids go and play at, my kids included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11466)|
| 3:11:12| We spend time socializing at barbecues and working in our gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| This community is in the middle of an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| and we have lived in harmony with the industrial park for nearly 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11479)|
| 3:11:25| but this proposed asphalt plant kind of crosses a line of what should be acceptable to place near a residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11485)|
| 3:11:32| Prior to buying my house in Asbury, I visited the house on several different occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| to scope out what the traffic, what the other sounds and smells would be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11496)|
| 3:11:41| and the traffic was the only concern, but the tradeoff was worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11501)|
| 3:11:45| If there had been an asphalt plant behind the house, there's no way I would have bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11505)|
| 3:11:51| And operating over a half mile from our community is Green Mountain Coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11511)|
| 3:11:56| The wind often blows in the direction that we can smell the coffee roasting, which is quite nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11516)|
| 3:12:01| The proposed asphalt plant is in the same direction as Green Mountain Coffee, yet would only be a few hundred feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11521)|
| 3:12:07| The documentation from the asphalt plant equipment manufacturer states that the hydrocarbons released as liquid asphalt is heated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11527)|
| 3:12:13| as what causes the distinct smell of asphalt, and as these materials reach higher temperatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| more of the hydrocarbons are released and condensed in the ambient air, causing the strong smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11538)|
| 3:12:23| Even with processes operating as efficiently as possible, the hot asphalt will be loaded into dump trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11543)|
| 3:12:28| and a hot load of asphalt in an open dump truck can easily be smelled 300 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11548)|
| 3:12:33| With the odors comes the fumes that we breathe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11553)|
| 3:12:36| A report from the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety on exposure to asphalt fumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11556)|
| 3:12:42| reported the studies concerning the acute toxic effects of exposure to asphalt fumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11562)|
| 3:12:47| have repeatedly found symptoms of irritation of serous membranes of the conjunctiva, or eye irritation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11567)|
| 3:12:52| and the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| Another publication in NIOSH states that employees should station themselves on the windward side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11576)|
| 3:13:00| of any source of asphalt emissions as far as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11580)|
| 3:13:03| We as residents of the community cannot position our properties on the windward side of this plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11583)|
| 3:13:08| We would be stuck with whatever fumes might be hanging over our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11588)|
| 3:13:12| Just being downwind from the plant, we could inhale the fumes that cause eye irritation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11592)|
| 3:13:17| and respiratory tract irritation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11597)|
| 3:13:20| Another aspect to be considered in this is temperature inversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11600)|
| 3:13:24| Being that we are located near the French Broad and Holston Rivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11604)|
| 3:13:27| we see temperature inversions more frequently than other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11607)|
| 3:13:31| Inversions hold particulate matter near ground level where people are breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11611)|
| 3:13:36| Any emissions produced by the plant will be held near the earth's surface longer than in normal conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11616)|
| 3:13:41| meaning that we will be breathing in more particulate matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11621)|
| 3:13:45| There will be sounds of heavy equipment dumping aggregates, conveyors moving materials, burners heating asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11625)|
| 3:13:51| the smell of hot asphalt hanging in the air and floodlights lighting up the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11631)|
| 3:13:56| Who wants to sit on their back porch with this going on 300 feet away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11636)|
| 3:14:00| Although the MPC staff have stated that there would not be significant injury to property value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| the fact is that very few people would be willing to buy a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| with this going on in their backyard unless the house was really cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11647)|
| 3:14:12| Many community members have worked hard to build equity in their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| and they take pride in their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| The installation of this plant would injure our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| I have reached out to Mr. Elschei through both email and both through voice message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11661)|
| 3:14:25| and I've never received contact back from him to discuss the issues with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11665)|
| 3:14:30| So in conclusion, this plant would detrimentally impact the community's enjoyment of their properties and property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11670)|
| 3:14:36| and this plant would ultimately detract from the vibrant character of the neighborhood and the community's quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| And at the end of time left, I'd like to bring Thomas Kintzer to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| He is a service tech for Tennessee Armature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11685)|
| 3:14:53| Thomas Kintzer, 403 Henry Haynes, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11693)|
| 3:14:59| As with my previous professional career, I worked for Tennessee Armature as a service technician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11699)|
| 3:15:05| and my duties were to work on asphalt plants and many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11705)|
| 3:15:09| But I've worked on asphalt plants from Athens, Tennessee, the Duracat plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| which is on Asbury Road, probably about a half to three-quarters of a mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11714)|
| 3:15:19| the I-75 plant off of Raccoon Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11719)|
| 3:15:24| And I'd just like to raise of hands if anyone's ever been on a property with an asphalt plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11724)|
| 3:15:32| For the ones that have not, have you ever driven behind an asphalt truck or through a construction zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11732)|
| 3:15:39| So you know what the smell is. It's not pleasant at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11739)|
| 3:15:43| These people here have homes that are 300 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11743)|
| 3:15:48| Just to kind of give you an idea, I played baseball for the University of Tennessee in 1998-99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11748)|
| 3:15:52| I could throw a baseball 300 feet. I could kick a football 70 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11752)|
| 3:15:56| That's almost 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11756)|
| 3:15:59| That's how close this asphalt plant is to their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11759)|
| 3:16:02| It's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| The noise and smells, dump trucks, all the, them loading the aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| There's five loading bins. They have to load different aggregates in the bins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11770)|
| 3:16:13| Then they have rotating augers that's going to be mixing these different aggregates together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11773)|
| 3:16:17| Thank you, sir. Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11777)|
| 3:16:21| I'm just trying to set a tone so that you can understand what an asphalt plant is and how close it is to these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11781)|
| 3:16:27| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11787)|
| 3:16:28| Can I get two more minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11788)|
| 3:16:30| Commissioner Buston has said go ahead and complete, but no more than two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11790)|
| 3:16:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| So you have these aggregates, these five bins they load constantly with front-end loaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| And every time they load, guess what they do? They back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11801)|
| 3:16:44| Beep, beep, beep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11804)|
| 3:16:46| 300 feet away, during the middle of the night, during the day, all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11806)|
| 3:16:52| Then you have, at night, you're going to have night lights on because they can't work in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11812)|
| 3:16:56| They have to have lights on for, you know, safety reasons for their workers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11816)|
| 3:17:00| Truck traffic, that's a whole other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| I-75 plant has a RV park that went in after the plant was put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11823)|
| 3:17:08| Well, every time I would drive past that RV park, everything is covered in dust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11828)|
| 3:17:13| because those trucks go in and out all the time on the gravel road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| Well, they have gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| 300 feet away, the wind blows towards those homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11838)|
| 3:17:21| and the trees and the RVs were covered in gravel dust because it just pulverizes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11841)|
| 3:17:27| because the trucks are so heavy, and they always have to put more gravel down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11847)|
| 3:17:30| always tending to the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11850)|
| 3:17:34| And, you know, I was on call a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11854)|
| 3:17:36| Every two weeks, I was on call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| And guess where I would end up in the middle of the night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| My phone would go off 1, 2 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11860)|
| 3:17:42| traveling to Athens or I-75 to repair an asphalt plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11862)|
| 3:17:46| You know why asphalt plants run in the middle of the night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| Because they pave in the middle of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11868)|
| 3:17:50| They don't pave I-40 during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11870)|
| 3:17:52| They pave it at night because of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11872)|
| 3:17:55| So these homeowners are going to have to see this working in the middle of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11875)|
| 3:18:00| And, you know, so just trying to set the tone for where these homeowners are at 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11880)|
| 3:18:08| In 98, when I was, you know, 20 years old, I could throw a baseball that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11888)|
| 3:18:14| Not far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11894)|
| 3:18:15| How far can you throw a baseball now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11898)|
| 3:18:19| I haven't tried in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11901)|
| 3:18:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11902)|
| 3:18:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11903)|
| 3:18:24| Sir, did you have anything else that you want to say before we go to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11904)|
| 3:18:28| Yeah, I think we're broad-ranging the asphalt plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| We don't do mainline TDOT work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| We very seldom work at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11913)|
| 3:18:36| Not to say that we won't from time to time, but, you know, we plan on being good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11916)|
| 3:18:39| The plant that we specced and got the air permit on is brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| It's not an old plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| It's a brand new plant that's being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| Soft starts, direct drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11928)|
| 3:18:50| It's the quietest that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11930)|
| 3:18:53| I'm not going to say they don't make any noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11933)|
| 3:18:54| but they don't make noise like they did in the 58 model plants we used to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11934)|
| 3:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11939)|
| 3:19:00| Mr. Reynolds, do you have something you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11940)|
| 3:19:02| Yeah, I just wanted to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11942)|
| 3:19:05| I did speak with Sean Payne in the Knox County Code's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11945)|
| 3:19:08| and we do have representatives here from the Knox County Air Quality Management Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11948)|
| 3:19:14| who do monitor these types of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11954)|
| 3:19:18| But in regard to Mr. Payne, he's not present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11958)|
| 3:19:22| I did ask him, you know, if they've had concerns from adjacent properties in the past with asphalt plants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11962)|
| 3:19:29| and in the 14 years he's been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| he doesn't recall there being any complaints in regard to nearby ones to other properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11971)|
| 3:19:37| obviously not in regard to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11977)|
| 3:19:40| Not all of them are near residential, but there are some that are in general facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11980)|
| 3:19:45| So I just wanted to let you know that there are representatives from Knox County Air Quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| If you want to ask them if you have any questions in regard to, I guess, what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11990)|
| 3:19:59| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| Commissioner Clancy, you had your light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12001)|
| 3:20:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| I'm wondering, and I guess Mr. Elscheit can tell me, the size of this plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12006)|
| 3:20:13| I mean, we've heard people talk about, you know, trailer parks covered in dust and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12013)|
| 3:20:20| Is this the same size as the Duracat plant or the Harrison plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12020)|
| 3:20:26| The Harrison plant is, I think, a 300 ton an hour or larger plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12026)|
| 3:20:30| This is a 200, so it's 50 percent smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12030)|
| 3:20:34| Talking about the dust with the traffic coming in, Air Quality can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12034)|
| 3:20:38| in our permit we're required to pave all the gravel area for the trucks coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12038)|
| 3:20:43| the trucks coming through the plant, the trucks taking the stockpile in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12043)|
| 3:20:46| And have you had to get an Air Quality permit from the EPA or TDEC or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12046)|
| 3:20:51| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12051)|
| 3:20:52| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12052)|
| 3:20:53| And we have a permit to construct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12053)|
| 3:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| Does the EPA govern any of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| Do you have to get any permits at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12062)|
| 3:21:04| I'll have to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12064)|
| 3:21:13| I'm Brian Rivera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12073)|
| 3:21:14| I work for the Knox County Air Quality Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12074)|
| 3:21:18| We are the delegated agency in Knox County to implement EPA's Clean Air Act rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12078)|
| 3:21:24| So we're the ones they have to get the permits from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12084)|
| 3:21:27| And you've looked over this plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12089)|
| 3:21:30| And, I mean, I read what they sent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12090)|
| 3:21:33| It looks like a pretty state-of-the-art plant to me that addresses some of the issues that the neighbors would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12093)|
| 3:21:42| This plant is actually one of the smaller plants in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12102)|
| 3:21:46| And EPA also reviewed the permit during the permitting process, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12106)|
| 3:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12112)|
| 3:21:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| Everybody has to drive on roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| And this is an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| I mean, you should be able to buy a piece of property, an industrial park, and plan to do industrial work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12120)|
| 3:22:07| I think the fact that they're, and I would assume that they're going to do a really nice vegetative screen and barrier that will be looked at by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12127)|
| 3:22:19| I just, I think this should be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12139)|
| 3:22:23| So I'll make a motion that we approve the asphalt plant with maximum capacity of 200 tons per hour as shown on the development plan subject to the seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12143)|
| 3:22:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| I have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Graff, but we do still have a few lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12154)|
| 3:22:39| So I'd like to hear from Commissioner Uten first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| I was going to say about what Mr. Graff said earlier, that we're having a tougher and tougher time to find properties to develop on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12162)|
| 3:22:52| I think he was referring to the gables at Westmoreland back earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12172)|
| 3:22:56| And we've got an applicant here that's not asking for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| He's asking to develop in the Forks of the River Industrial Park that the county's provided to do things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| And I think it's an appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12184)|
| 3:23:06| And I would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12186)|
| 3:23:09| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12189)|
| 3:23:11| A question for Mr. Kinzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12191)|
| 3:23:12| Is this the, is this property a previous use of a trucking terminal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12192)|
| 3:23:18| Is that the same property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| Yes, it is a previous use of a trucking terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12202)|
| 3:23:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12203)|
| 3:23:24| And if I remember, I think the biggest complaint there was the dust kickup from all the trucks going in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12204)|
| 3:23:32| because it's a gravel lot and it's really problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12212)|
| 3:23:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12217)|
| 3:23:38| So here's my concern with that is, yes, it was a trucking company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12218)|
| 3:23:42| But if you're running 200 tons per hour, that's nine trucks per hour because there's 22 tons on each truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12222)|
| 3:23:50| That is every six minutes a truck rolls out of that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| And in that trucking terminal, there was never a truck in and out every six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12233)|
| 3:23:57| And they're already proposed to doing, they can double the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12237)|
| 3:24:01| So that would be 400 tons per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12241)|
| 3:24:03| That's what they said when they just appeared just a few minutes ago, go to 400 tons per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12243)|
| 3:24:06| So that would be a truck every three and a half minutes at full capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12246)|
| 3:24:10| So at that trucking terminal, they never saw capacity like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12250)|
| 3:24:16| I'm very sensitive and it's unfortunate that the homes reside just about 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12256)|
| 3:24:21| And the homes were there before the industrial park was ever there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| And I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12264)|
| 3:24:25| And it's unfortunate that, you know, at some point you have to give way to some type of progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12265)|
| 3:24:30| especially since it's been deemed an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12270)|
| 3:24:34| And so how I differentiate this one from, let's say, the Straw Plains Fag one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12274)|
| 3:24:39| you know, that wasn't designated as an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12279)|
| 3:24:42| This one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12282)|
| 3:24:43| There are a lot of intensive uses over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12283)|
| 3:24:46| I mean, you've got Burkhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12286)|
| 3:24:47| There's a house directly across the street from Burkhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12287)|
| 3:24:50| We're talking about kicking up all kinds of stuff at Burkhart Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12290)|
| 3:24:53| You've got it there, baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12293)|
| 3:24:54| And then you've got, you know, the old Weigel's Farm where Miss Cruz operates her business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12294)|
| 3:25:01| You know, that used to all be farmland, but it's now since transitioned into industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12301)|
| 3:25:07| And that house that you're looking at across from Burkhart Farm is $80,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| and it's been bought after Burkhart was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12310)|
| 3:25:13| These people have been living here since 1979, and it was a field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12313)|
| 3:25:18| And they didn't complain when the trucking company went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12318)|
| 3:25:20| They didn't even come to the meeting when it was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12320)|
| 3:25:23| So, you know, this is a whole different ball of wax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| I mean, anybody here want to buy a house next to 300 feet from an asphalt plant, raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12326)|
| 3:25:33| Well, I think that the public somewhat has a certain awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12333)|
| 3:25:37| except for the ones that have been there all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12337)|
| 3:25:40| But the fact is they had time to transition out as well before all of these heavy intensive uses came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12340)|
| 3:25:47| No one's moved because they love the Asbury community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12347)|
| 3:25:50| I'm going to let Emily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12350)|
| 3:25:54| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12354)|
| 3:25:55| Yeah, you've got just a short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| This is the last case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| The last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12361)|
| 3:26:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12362)|
| 3:26:03| Hey, my name's Colleen Cruz-Batee, and my address is 2731 Asbury Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12363)|
| 3:26:07| I just moved to Asbury Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| I bought a house next to the pizza bar and an ice cream shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12369)|
| 3:26:13| I'm putting down some roots there because that's where, 100 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| that's where my family started dairy farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| And you know, if you've been out there, it's really pretty, even though it's an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12377)|
| 3:26:23| And I know, you know, I live in an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| But when you're going down Asbury Road, when you enter it, it's really not industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12385)|
| 3:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12391)|
| 3:26:32| The industrial park is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12392)|
| 3:26:33| But you've got these old homes, old houses, the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12393)|
| 3:26:36| I take my kids to the playground, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12396)|
| 3:26:38| And an asphalt plant will be right there at the entrance of Asbury Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12398)|
| 3:26:42| There's a lot of property back there to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| It's just I wish you all could come and see exactly where this asphalt plant is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12404)|
| 3:26:49| And, you know, I'm happy to meet my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| Hi, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12411)|
| 3:26:52| I'm Colleen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12412)|
| 3:26:53| And, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| I think we all can live together happily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| But maybe you all can help us get some advice on how we can live in an industrial park and not get pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12417)|
| 3:27:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12425)|
| 3:27:06| If you all have any advice for me, I'd love to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12426)|
| 3:27:09| Go to Knox County Air Control and make sure everybody gets a permit and complies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12429)|
| 3:27:15| and they get tested periodically for what emissions they face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12435)|
| 3:27:19| What about the trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12439)|
| 3:27:20| You know, like who monitors the pretty trees that are going to line it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12440)|
| 3:27:24| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12444)|
| 3:27:25| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12445)|
| 3:27:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12446)|
| 3:27:27| So what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12447)|
| 3:27:28| Your neighbors do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12448)|
| 3:27:29| When there is conditions for landscape screening, Knox County is not going to go out and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12449)|
| 3:27:33| they've got the landscape screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12453)|
| 3:27:34| They've got you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12454)|
| 3:27:35| I don't want to be the bad guy, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12457)|
| 3:27:38| I don't want to be that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12458)|
| 3:27:39| Well, designate one of your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| You get a designated bad guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| But you folks really need to be the people that are watching to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12463)|
| 3:27:49| All my family is buried there, too, in Asbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| I mean, it's still a community, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| I know it's an industrial park, but I'll be buried, too, in Asbury Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12473)|
| 3:27:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12477)|
| 3:27:59| Mr. Reynolds, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12479)|
| 3:28:00| Did you have something more to contribute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12480)|
| 3:28:02| I just wanted to clarify what the maximum capacity can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12482)|
| 3:28:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12485)|
| 3:28:06| The staff recommendation is to cap the maximum capacity at 200 tons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12486)|
| 3:28:11| so if they wanted to expand their plant beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| they would have to come back through another use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12493)|
| 3:28:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| I think that, no, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12498)|
| 3:28:21| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Clancy, seconded by Commissioner Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12501)|
| 3:28:26| to approve the asphalt plant with the maximum capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12513)|
| 3:28:34| Are there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12514)|
| 3:28:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12515)|
| 3:28:36| We have two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12516)|
| 3:28:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12518)|
| 3:28:40| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12520)|
| 3:28:42| And, again, really and truly, the community needs to watch and make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12522)|
| 3:28:49| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190314?start=12529)|
