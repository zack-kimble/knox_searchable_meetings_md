| 0:00:00| Commissioner Shelf. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just I see Greg McKay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| Scott Frith here. I just wondered if they had any words of wisdom or any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4)|
| 0:00:08| suggestions or anything to add to the debate or just if don't if you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| here for other than just for questions but I'd love to hear your input. My name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=12)|
| 0:00:24| is Greg McKay. I'm the Administrator of Elections and my address is room 214 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=24)|
| 0:00:28| the courthouse. The reason this came up is there were a couple things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| needed to fix in the in the recall amendment. We need to clarify that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| in fact section 805 which has been done in that one that Dr. Briggs brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| The state also recommended that removing the part that says shall an election of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| a successor be held and that's been done in the version that he's presented. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| of course there's the question of the timing. The way it's written now if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| there is a recall on the August election and that the wording in the in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| petition and the charter says within 90 to 95 days we'll have a primary, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| that puts us past the November election. We can't certify the election in time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| make the next election on the same day as the general election. So we'd end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| having a general election in 2010 for example in November 4th I believe it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| and then we'd have to have another election a week of Thanksgiving and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| that's just there's no reason for that. The timing needs to be coincided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| where if you're going to have another election let's do it along with the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| general election. So when there's a vacancy in county offices it's covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| in state law in section 5-1-104 and this applies to all except for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| office in the county. So what the way doctors written this is this would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| away with with the special primary to where you'd have to have you know two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| elections to to choose a successor instead of just one. There may be a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| when you have to have one special election. There's really only two chances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| when you take state law and look at it and just in case there's any question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| when it comes to elections state law trumps what the charter says. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| only two chances to recall someone. It's in August and November of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| midterm. If somebody went in in 08 and gets recalled they can only be recalled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| in the August or the November of 2010. Anything else is too soon, anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| is too late. It's the only two general elections. So if you have an August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| recall the way it's written now you could coincide the successor election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| with the November election and the cost to the taxpayer would be minimal. We'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| have to run an ad in the paper. If there's a November recall then you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| have to have a special election sometime in February but you'd only have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| one if you're eliminating the primary for this one office. And of course the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| next question is a policy decision for the Commission to decide how low to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| it. You don't want to make it too low because you don't you know you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| want to turn around and be having ten recall elections every election. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| don't want to make it so high that it's impossible to do otherwise what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| point of having it. So that's a decision that you'll have to make. We came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| a chart of different scenarios. I hope you'll keep one thing. I didn't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| this until we started looking into this and that is the city has a recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| provision in their charter. It's set at 30% of whatever the number was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| voted in the last person's election. So just for an example there's a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| council person who you could recall right now with 1,225 names. Yet it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| doesn't continually happen. Every time someone gets mad at them voting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| certain way, nobody runs around and gets recall petitions. So bear that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| But again it's whatever you all decide we'll be glad to comply with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| charter and state law. Commissioner Lupo. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Great. So I asked a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| question back in intergovernmental. If the recall was done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| November what would happen? And I don't know that it says here that we'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| have a special election to replace the recalled official. It would simply be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| done by the Commission or am I missing that? Because there's not another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| election and why should we spend another $250,000 to $300,000 on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| election when if there's any other vacancy that would occur for any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| reason we don't hold a special election the Commission would make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| appointment and they just continue to serve for the remainder of the term. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Law Director is that not the way it should happen or is that is there have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| you can you answer that? That's my understanding yes sir. Okay so if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| recall is in November then we would the Commission would simply appoint and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| would serve the remainder of the term and we wouldn't even have to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| the cost of a special election after that. They would just serve it out. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| want to make sure I'm clear on that. Point of order Mr. Chairman. Where are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| in the debate right now? Do we have a motion on the floor? Yes. Okay and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| motion is the first part of the split. It's to approve. We've got a second so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| we're in that part of the debate. Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you. The only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| that we're not debating now is the number of signatures. Okay so we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| debating the first part and that's it. Okay. Commissioner Hammond. Mr. Chairman this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| time length that would fit into what you're talking about as far as what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| time frame. Greg do you have any thoughts on what an acceptable time frame would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| be in terms of allowing these people to get their petitions? If nine months is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| too long? Is three months too short? Is it just basically what we decide or it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=355)|
| 0:06:04| seems to me that if somebody's motivated they're gonna go out and get petitions. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| just remember the wheel tax vote. I remember the hotel vote. When people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| motivated they get out and get the signatures and so I'm just wondering it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| just seems to me that nine months would be a bit long but I'm wondering what an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| acceptable time frame would be. Well the state standard is pointed out earlier is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| 75 days but the county has the authority to make that more if they want to but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| you run into the logistical problem and that is if you can't be recalled the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| first year and it takes 30 days to get the paperwork approved and then you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| got to get it in 60 days before the election you simply can't have one of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| year as basis. You brought up a good point about the wheel tax. The wheel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| people had 30 days to get their names. Now they had a lower standard. They only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| had to have 10% of the registered voters to do the wheel tax but they only had 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| days from the day that was approved so you know you've got a point there. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| gonna make sure I understand the procedure now for a recall. You said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| there's only one time that basically you could recall an official if it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| four-year term and that would be... Really two times. Yeah okay so it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| okay after the first year someone wants to recall someone they go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| process and get their petitions okay then what happens? Let's say that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| petitions are approved when would it be on the ballot? At the next general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| election and a general election is defined as one that's countywide and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| it's not a primary so there's only two elections and they're the August and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| November elections of even years. So if it was on the August ballot for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| and the people are just basically voting whether or not to recall that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| That's correct. So if they voted in favor of recalling that person then it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| be on the November ballot but that would be a primary is that correct? No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| well right the way it's been written I think would well state law says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| there won't be a primary. There won't be a primary so it'd be up to the political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| parties then to select someone who would be a Republican or Democratic candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| right and then anyone that wanted to vote would be or wanted to run that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| were not the party nominee they would be independent. That's correct. They would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| on the ballot but November would decide who that person would be to serve. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| successor that's correct. Okay the you said it's 30% in the city of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| who voted in that race. That's correct. Okay I got another question about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| cost if you did a district race with regards to cost how much would that cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| if you just did a district race and I know it's different in each but roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| what would be a an average? I'd have to we've never really done one before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| I can remember. But if it's in the general election it's not really gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| matter. 25 well if it's in a general election it won't matter. It'll be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| cost of an ad which you know in the newspaper but if you had to have just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| standalone election it'd probably be thirty forty thousand dollars for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| district. Commissioner Lambert. Yeah I just want to say I'm not going to speak about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=538)|

| 0:48:56| would agree with most what everybody said. It should not become too easy. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| thrown a lot of figures around but bottom line it comes back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| particular race. To me the most equitable solution would be a percentage in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| opinion 51% of the votes cast for that particular spot. So and as Dave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=2956)|
| 0:49:25| mentioned, you know, there's not a whole lot we can do. We're going to be beating this again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=2965)|

| 0:49:46| or against you. Looking at these figures here if you will ever want to look at this 15% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| race here. I had more people. I got 60 some percent of the vote and it would only take 1,626 people to recall me if I was running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=2991)|
| 0:50:03| Well, there was more people than that voted against me. So that would be very easy for them to get 1,600 and I'm sure if everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| looks at it, it's the same thing. I got 60 some percent but yet there were more than 1,600 people voted against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3009)|

| 0:50:23| So we don't need to make it too easy in my opinion. And if you'll look at your figures, it's probably that many, it's probably less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3023)|

| 0:53:46| can imagine. So I just want to urge people to think, don't think about today, don't think about these two office holders, think about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3226)|
| 0:53:57| future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| Thanks. Well, Dave, I'm thinking about the voters. And, you know, 15% of gubernatorial voters in District 2 was 1568, I think, and 50% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3243)|
| 0:54:19| votes cast for that office would be 1685, so it's a difference of like 100 votes. So that's pretty close to the 50% mark right there. I don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| problem with the 50% of votes cast in that office. If people are preferring that we base the number on how many people voted in that office, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3265)|
| 0:54:38| fine with the 50%. I think that that's a reasonable number. So, like I said, let's do something and then move on, because we've got to do this again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3278)|
| 0:54:48| next month and we have to have two. And really, I think we need to have the public hearings before we start deciding what we're going to do next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| And I think that's the percentage we're going to put on this and hear what the voters have to say and base our decision on their input instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| what we think is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| Thank you. The far-reaching unintended consequence would be trusting the voters, as Commissioner Wright mentioned. 10% of the registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3308)|
| 0:55:17| yields a reasonable number. 15% of the gubernatorial yields a reasonable number. As Commissioners Brown and Pinkston have pointed out, if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| to do it based on actual turnout, and 50% of that, which was Commissioner Briggs' original proposal, that also yields a reasonable number and makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3324)|
| 0:55:32| sense. I'm happy with any one of these, because they're all a threshold below where we have all now, and they present a defined figure. So let's go for one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3332)|
| 0:55:41| those three options, because any one of those three options makes sense. And then hold a second vote in the public hearing and all the stuff. Let's trust the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| voters, not only to judge this issue, but trust the voters overall when it comes to recalls. And a standard of 50% who voted in that particular office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3348)|
| 0:56:00| being recalled, which was the original Briggs proposal, seems to have enough here that I hope we'll go for that one. But any one of those three, that one, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3360)|
| 0:56:09| 10% of registered voters, 15% gubernatorial, all are in the same range and all are reasonable choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| It takes you 51% to get elected, so you ought to have to be 51%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| 50% plus one to get elected, but I see the idea, Mike Brown. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3382)|

| 0:56:40| We have a motion, which was the 25%, and then we have a substitute motion of 15% of the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| And if we have no more lights, we're going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3406)|

| 0:57:02| The question, let me back up then and let me ask my question. As Dr. Harmon has said, we've really got three things before us and we have public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| hearings to come. How do we craft what we're doing this evening to be first reading to then have a second reading, or are we really going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3428)|
| 0:57:24| first reading again next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| Depending on what, if there is a substantial change from the first to second reading, then we would actually be going back to a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| I think we need to have some type of number, this is just my opinion, I think we need to have some type of number tonight so that when we go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3457)|
| 0:57:47| there, we have a public hearing, that when we come back, then we can debate this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3467)|
| 0:57:56| And if we come up with a number that's not a substantial change, then we're on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| If it is a substantial change, then we would be back at a first reading, but we're still not talking, we still have plenty of time, because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3481)|
| 0:58:10| won't even go on the ballot until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| So we do have time on our side right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Does that answer everybody's question? Does anybody have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| Well, we don't have any lights and I don't have a second to your call, so we're going to go to the votes, voting on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3507)|

| 1:00:47| So we're now on the original motion, which is 25% of the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| Thank you, Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| Since we don't have a substitute motion on the floor, are we permitted to make a substitute motion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| We can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| And I'm doing this because a lot of these numbers get to be very close, but there seems to be a little bit more consensus for this and the numbers are a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| I was going to make a motion that we make it 51%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| I'm just trying to get, I'm going to vote for anything that comes by, I'll tell you, because I want to move on, but I'm trying to find something from what I've heard that people will vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3678)|
| 1:01:33| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| Well, Commissioner Lambert, your light's on, I'm going to allow you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| The numbers are so close, I would argue that there's very little difference between Ms. Broyles' proposal and Mr. Briggs' proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| The numbers are so close, I would challenge that he's essentially asking to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| And since he was not on the prevailing side, I would think that he would not have that option open to him, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| Well, Commissioner Lambert, I'm going to ask the law director his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3728)|
| 1:02:18| Well, a substitute motion is this, that, and just that, and if it doesn't mirror precisely the other motion, then it's within the province of the commission to proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3738)|
| 1:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3748)|
| 1:02:36| I'm going to rule that he can make that as a proper substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| I just have a problem with basing this on the election of that particular office, because if you take a look at, for instance, if you go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| trustee's office, you had 18,000 votes cast in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| On the same day, the sheriff, you had 24,000 votes cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| The county clerk, you had 17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| And you have the different numbers, primarily depending on whether it's a contested race or an uncontested race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| And that's why I don't think basing it on how many votes it took to put someone in that office is as good as having a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3790)|
| 1:03:18| such as gubernatorial or some other election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| But I will go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3803)|

| 1:03:44| And that's the top line on the one that Mr. McKay prepared for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| And all of those standards are higher, and that addresses, and I really understand what Commissioner McKenzie brought up before, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| where there was just, you know, for ten percent of the gubernatorial votes, it was 810 votes, and this moves up to 2,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3837)|
| 1:04:05| To be honest, I don't remember having that discussion. I wasn't at the last Senate government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| I brought that up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| That was brought up in the finance committee, that if it was a low turnout race, we were afraid of losing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| I'm like you. I'm willing to move this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| Commissioner Briggs, have you made a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| I make a motion to approve ten percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| I have a second. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| Well, that's two motions. That's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3885)|

| 1:04:55| And I have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| When you're voting to recall a person, you're not recalling to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| You're recalling that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| The ones that voted for him should have the opportunity to get him out or her. That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| If you would like to make a suggestion on something we can pass, I'll be delighted to withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=3915)|

| 1:06:45| Okay. I've got a question. All right. Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| Can we do some numerical comparison between that offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| and 25 percent of gubernatorial? Because I don't have numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4015)|

| 1:07:10| Okay. Well, basically you're talking about the difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| 10 percent of registered voters countywide, according to this chart, would be about 26,000 to 30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| Yeah, it's just like just add the two bottom lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| Which, in my opinion, is not a big difference in number of signatures countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| I just think it's best to base it on a better standard, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| which is gubernatorial election versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4056)|

| 1:07:56| Countywide, 25 percent of the gubernatorial votes would be 30,621.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| It's the total difference of 40,000 and 4,300 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| Okay. Signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4086)|

| 1:13:31| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| To move things along, I'm going to recommend that rather than having this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| that you appoint a committee to take a look at this, to work with the mayor's office about the current lobbyists that we now have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| take a look at costs, options, et cetera, and report back to commission in January with a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| and a possible recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| There may not be a recommendation, but to go ahead and just take a look at it and report back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4429)|

| 1:14:17| Of the three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4457)|

| 1:14:22| Will four be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4462)|

| 1:14:27| Commissioner Burroughs would like to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Four-member committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| Do we need a resolution on that or I think that's something the chair could just do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| Yes, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Appointing an ad hoc committee, which I think the chairman can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| Commissioner Lampert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4481)|

| 1:15:02| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Six-oh, send on to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| Commissioner Armstrong or Norman, do you want to take the lead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| I had a discussion last month and it seems like that our expertise is in disagreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4515)|
| 1:15:25| with our reality sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| And I just wanted to bring some pictures before county commission tonight where we could actually see what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4527)|
| 1:15:35| and let county commission understand what was viewed on the days that there's no problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4535)|
| 1:15:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| I don't really know what kind of recommendations we're going to have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| or how we're going to have to get some resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| It's really clear that our expertise said that we don't have any problems on Ms. Cole's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4553)|
| 1:16:01| and that there's no runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| But if you can see right there in the first thing, this was as of Sunday, coming off lot 17 is in your first picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| There's muddy water flowing down toward the creek property and Ms. Cole's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| I don't know where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Up there is the house on lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| You can look in the woods where the water is coming into the creek right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| That's about a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| The next picture shows you another shot of it on that same particular situation on the same day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| where evidently this is acceptable standards to Knox County at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| It's what's been the testimony to date is what is acceptable in Knox County's behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| that there's no violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| There's some more pictures of the same instance on the same particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| If you look in this picture, if you look off to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| we have clear water coming in from the left-hand side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| and we have dirty water coming in from the, quote, construction side of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| But evidently nothing's really happening and there's no sediment in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| and there's really no problems as it relates to Ms. Cole's property based upon testimony that's been brought before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4621)|
| 1:17:08| And so I just wanted to bring in some independent pictures so I wouldn't have to have you all walk out there in the rain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| and see in reality what's going on in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| And the only reason is we've had testimony tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| We have a real serious storm water issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| The reason I keep bringing Ms. Cole's in is because I wanted to use it as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| We've got a man's house here that's floating away underneath him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| And I'm here to tell you if you get moisture underneath your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| and you have tile floors, you're up a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| Your doors will skid off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| Your sheetrock will crack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Your floors will pop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| It's a serious situation and that's a constructional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| So what we're trying to do, and I'm not going to belabor Bruce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| because I'm not going to bring him up here as an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| But, you know, because the answers I always get out of the department is we'll have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| We'll have to find more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| We'll have to see more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| I don't see what you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| And I don't know what county commission can do about this other than we may be making a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| where we may do a demonstration project next year on how to remediate streams as part of a training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4693)|
| 1:18:21| for our storm water people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| We can do that without any problems with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| And the money will probably have to come from some department that that's under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4708)|
| 1:18:35| I don't know how we can get this issue straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| But we're going to have to start thinking about, as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| what we're going to do with the problems that we already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| not just storm water ordinances that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| We had a gentleman walk in here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| I mean, his life is flowing away underneath him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| I am 100 percent for development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| We need development to have our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| We need development for places for people to live and people to play and people to have recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| and people to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| But when my land starts messing up your land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| and when my house starts messing up your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| it's incumbent upon us as a community here together to address these problems and to solve these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| And this man over here has got a serious problem, but we've got to investigate it to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| By the time we investigate his problem to death, his house will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| It's really evidently the reality of county commission is that we don't have any authority at all in this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| because I've never seen anything happen from whether it be the green disposal since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| whether it be lost money since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| whether it be this man's house floating away since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| whether it be Laura Cole's property for the last three years and since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| It's quite evident that we have no authority in Knox County at all other than we can sit here and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| And if that's all the authority that I and the 8th District Commission Seat A has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| then I'm going to talk about it until I'm no longer in the 8th District Commission Seat A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| But I wanted to at least bring the reality to you tonight as to what happened just Sunday and just a week before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| And, I mean, I hate to say I'm just an old country boy, but I know muddy water when I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| And I don't need a Ph.D. in dirt to know when I know when dirt is flowing in water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| And I know when the stream stops flowing, sediment settles, and it ruins streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| And I do know that we may need to get an independent body to come in and look at these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| I am not opposed to going to Atlanta and getting EPA Region 4 up here in a heartbeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| I come out of the environmental world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| I know a lot of people down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I'm more than willing to call in one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| I have a wetland expert and water expert that is a personal friend of mine with a Ph.D. in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| I've got no problem calling him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| If he'll come in here and see if he recognizes dirt when he sees it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| I hate to say dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| They hate to say dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| And see if the soil is rivet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| And see if we really have plant life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| And see if it's really being endangered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| And see if the oxidation is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| And see if all these scientific elements are really there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| I believe they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| And I know that agricultural related to Miss Cole's property is all downstream, not upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| So it can't be agricultural problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| There's no agricultural at the top of this watershed flowing into her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| It's all beyond her and down below her watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| So I'm thinking about personally looking at see if we can't get some help from the Corps of Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| It's quite evident we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| And get some help from the Environmental Protection Agency out of Atlanta where people maybe can give us some advice as to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| to handle water that disappears and reappears or flows across the surface underneath grass and gathers dirt or soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4916)|
| 1:22:04| And leaves sediment deposits in the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| And we don't know what to do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| So if we as Knox County have met a point of where we don't know what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| then maybe we need to look out elsewhere to see if we can help solve these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| Because as we had testimony tonight, we have a serious stormwater problem in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| I don't want to burden on our builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| But it can be done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| But I don't want to harm my neighbor when I'm doing something in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| And I don't want my neighbor to harm me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| And it's happening all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| And we as a body sit here and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| And nothing's ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| But that's my discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| If anybody else has any comments, they're more than welcome to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| I was just going to make a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| And, I mean, these are really serious problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| But some of these are where, you know, we've heard the elderly gentleman that comes here that's having problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| with his children or other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| We have the incident that occurred today, which is just terrible, with the gentleman in his house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| where this individual is flooding him and causing him harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| And, of course, the creek problem is also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| But sometimes this is where individuals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| I mean, we need to change our ordinances so they're stricter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| But when damage – when one individual is causing damage to another, what authority does the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| I mean, usually these things are taken care of in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| And, I mean, I think there's some things that we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| I mean, we can set rules and regulations and set stormwater ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| But if harm actually occurs after that's been done, I mean, is this the place where this needs to be adjudicated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| Or should this be handled in the courts where the person causing the damage has to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| And, I mean, I don't want Knox County having to take – I mean, there's a case that I brought to the stormwater people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| where a gentleman over where I live is being flooded by a commercial building next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| But it seems like that who's causing the harm should have to pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| And just like the elderly gentleman who's having a problem with his driver's license and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| I mean, that seems like some of these things need to be adjudicated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| And it's the same thing with Brad Bay's issue is that some of this needs to be handled in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| And not here because they're the ones that have the authority to do something about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| and pay for the damages if one individual has harmed another individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| You know, this continues to go on, obviously, and it's tiresome to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| The body knows that the stormwater ordinance is going to be reviewed as part of our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5087)|
| 1:24:56| There's a couple of things that come up, and if it's permissible to the chair for Mr. Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| and I to discuss this across the way here as we bring this topic up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| I'd like to do that because we never do discuss it except when it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5111)|
| 1:25:19| One thing that I've noticed in the code is that the director, Mr. Weitrick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5119)|
| 1:25:29| has fairly broad discretionary powers about how he can, what he will do or what he might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| And this is, I may need Mr. Jarrett to weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| But I looked up a couple items from the code, and this is from Chapter 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5142)|
| 1:25:50| Environment, Section 26-252, Section D and L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| And I'm just going to read this right quick to illustrate how discretionary his powers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| And Section D says that the director may require more stringent standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| or best management practices than those required by the state general NPDES permit for discharges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| of stormwater associated with construction sites for priority construction activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| or where deemed necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| And then in Section L, the director shall have the authority to require greater than 70% coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| of perennial vegetation, blah, blah, blah, for erosion prevention, sediment control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5190)|
| 1:26:38| control portion of the performance bond if the site is a priority construction activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| has elevated potential of erosion or offsite damages or has caused past damages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| offsite due to sediment discharges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| So these items that are in our code, I think, empower the director in this situation to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5212)|
| 1:27:05| to address the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| And the stormwater department continues to come before us and say that we can't do anything according to the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5227)|
| 1:27:16| and I don't think that's necessarily so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| I don't know what Mr. Armstrong thinks about that, but it sounds to me, and I'm not a liar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| and Mr. Armstrong is a liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| But it sounds to me like given the length of time that we've dealt with this, discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| had it before us, that it's time for our engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| and stormwater department in particular to say we're going to address this in the following ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| rather than say we're going to study it again and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| we're just not sure where that water's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| It's going underground, and it may be underground erosion or whatever from another site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| It's apparent it's coming from the developed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| It's coming from Lot 17, and it's time for something to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| And I think it's time for the director to step up and say this is what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| I need to say one comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Tony, I appreciate your comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| And Commissioner Briggs, I agree that there's a time for litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| You sound kind of funny and stupid coming from an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| but that's the last step I want to see taken is litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| And when the community comes to us as a body for solutions that we have an opportunity to provide solutions for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5324)|
| 1:28:52| and if there are violations, we have the leverage to put the leverage on these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| We have remedies at hand in different cases, and it's up to the director to see how this is going to be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| But we can actually go out and remediate, put liens on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| and take care of business at hand and correct things if we so deem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| And that's a policy decision and a budgetary decision and a departmental decision that has to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| Short of litigation and as a last fallback, even if all that's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| and damage is still there, they can litigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| But I think we need to at least show the community that we're willing to at least try to protect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| and enforce our ordinances and remediate any problems where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| That's just kind of where I'm standing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Commissioner Armstrong, I was listening intently, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| And I do have a Ph.D., but it wasn't in dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| But I also listened intently to Commissioner Briggs, who ironically was giving good legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| and that is that torts are a remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| But like you said, torts are a last remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| I mean, when someone does wrong to someone else's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| you'd like to have your county government enforcing things properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| As Commissioner Norman pointed out, we seem to have a great deal of discretion that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| and it's leading to sort of what I'm thinking is a lax approach to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| So I'm going to say something rather outrageous here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| The one power we do have, I mean, granted, you and I can go to EPA and complain, and we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| But the one power that every legislative body has is that of the purse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| And if we don't get some action soon, I'd be happy to introduce legislation to have a moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| on the stormwater budget or the entire public works budget until we get action to satisfy these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| Because clearly we have an enforcement problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| and we have too many people's properties being flooded by improper enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| I'd be happy to go forward with that if we don't soon see action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| I'd like to remind everyone that Mr. Weitrick actually asked for more of a budget to add some stormwater people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5465)|
| 1:31:17| That's an argument, not a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| I didn't get a commissioner in front of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| I guess I'm just wanting to kind of understand where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| I know Mr. Jarrett issued a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| And Mr. Jarrett, if you could, if you don't mind, to kind of give a brief recap of what, well, I guess what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| We asked you to speak with, I guess it was TDAC, and you did that, and they issued a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5503)|
| 1:31:51| Could you kind of go over what that said about this cold property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| Yes, sir, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| What occurred, as you recall, the commission directed me to send a letter to TDAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| essentially asking for enforcement on that property of their rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| When I was inquiring as to the proper person to whom to send the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| I received an e-mail advising me that they had just sent out a letter on that very subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| essentially saying that they saw no further action they could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| So the bottom line is TDAC at this point feels there is no current pending violation for which enforcement lies in terms of TDAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5540)|
| 1:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| So we asked for that thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| I don't know what we were thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| I guess some folks may have thought that that would be an arm or a hammer, and quite frankly it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| They're happy with things the way they are on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| I guess one thing that bothered me through this whole dialogue, and I'm not trying to point a finger anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5569)|
| 1:32:57| but if we're going to solve this storm ordinance, it wasn't created, you know, in a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| and we passed a really tough ordinance a while ago, but it took us a long time to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5584)|
| 1:33:12| And I guess what I'm saying is it's going to take a community of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| One of the things that bothered me is that the gentleman that spoke earlier said that NPC voted that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| voted a tougher ordinance down than Ms. Cole actually, in fact voted not to kind of slap that guy on his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5606)|
| 1:33:34| And that's troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| I mean, it's going to take NPC, it's going to take the BZA, and it's going to take commission as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| we can beat up Bruce, but if Bruce doesn't have precedent to go out and enforce some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| in fact TDAC is saying quite the opposite, you know, we can bash him, and that's great and it's fun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| and everyone is looking at us on TV, but the reality of it is, I mean, he has certain guidelines to go by, he has some leeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5634)|
| 1:34:02| but if he goes out there enforcing things that TDAC is not going to back him on, then, you know, what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| What are we setting ourselves up for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| So I guess I'll say, you know, we can, and I don't mind discussing this every month, we can discuss Ms. Cole's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5652)|
| 1:34:19| this gentleman's property, and I'm sorry I didn't catch your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| We can have these discussions every month, and I'm, you know, will listen intently, but I think the bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| I think we need to, I don't think this is a forum for it, other than getting it out there and in the public eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5670)|
| 1:34:38| and I think we've done a pretty good job of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| I know this discussion item has been on the agenda for quite a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| so I guess what I'm trying to figure out is what is the end result of having these discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| Go ahead, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| In regards to Ms. Cole's problem, when you go out and look at lot number 17, which has been brought up several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| the lot has been sodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| It doesn't get any better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| So when someone says we're not enforcing the ordinance, in fact, we are enforcing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| I can't go out there and cite him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| There is nothing that we can see that he's in violation of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| That's not to say Ms. Cole does not have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| It just means I don't have any legal precedence or anything within the legal framework that I work under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| to go out there and cite someone and say you're in violation of this or you haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| The lot is sodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| I mean, I wish every lot in Knox County was in that good of condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| So to say we're not enforcing the ordinance is simply untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| And then we brought TDEC in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| We didn't say that there was no violations out there because TDEC said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| but they came in and concurred with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| Bringing in the Environmental Protection Agency, any of these other agencies you want to bring in, I welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| Because, quite frankly, there is nothing else that I know that we can do within our legal framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5756)|
| 1:36:05| I'm not sure if the light zone is in between Avon and Fenbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| Which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| I'll go next since I'm the smallest of the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| I work for the city stormwater engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| And I see situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| I can't believe that a guy can go out and build a golf course in a man's community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| without somebody in the community raising a can about it and bringing it to the city or the county's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| We constantly have mediation in the city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| We charge these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| We have fined them up to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| I've seen them have to pay the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| We know we can do it, but we've got to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| Now, I'm not picking on Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| I'm not picking on his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| But he's got the teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| He's just going to start biting them a little bit, make it hurt before they get the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| Now, once the problem is done, talking about the lot where the sod is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| if there's muddy water coming off that property, it may not be coming off that lot, but it's coming somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| So somebody needs to be there when it's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| It may be on Sunday afternoon like Mr. Armstrong was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| but somebody needs to be there to see where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| You want to address that, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| Well, just so you know, we also issue fines, upwards to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| We've issued over $200,000 in fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| We're not, it's not, this situation is somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| This is not something that we're just saying, yeah, we know the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| We see the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| We're not going to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| We've come back and say, we cannot find the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| I can't pin it on an individual or a project because physically you go out there and look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| and you cannot see a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| You can see the results of a problem that's caused by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| You can say it's caused by the development or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| You can see the results of it, but you can't see the source from where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| I cannot in good conscience issue citations on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| Mr. Chairman, I guess this comes back to a larger question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| and that is when I read in the paper that the head of our MPC says that our code enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| is basically two people in a truck, that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| And I think we're going to be hearing here in just a moment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| But I think that as we look into our budget next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| we've got to really look at these provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| and seeing how we're going to enforce this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| But I guess my bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| If we know that on Ms. Cole's property that something is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| we've called the state, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| we know something's happening, but nobody knows where it's coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| somebody can find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| I mean, there has to be a smart person in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| that can go out there and look at that and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| this is where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| If we can't do it in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| is there somebody that can go out there and tell us where this is coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| I would have to believe that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| And with regards to the gentleman's property here on the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| what needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| I mean, if we were to say, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| here's what we need to do to fix this gentleman's problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| I would like to find out, like on Ms. Cole's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Do we need to find somebody, hire somebody from outside to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| and go out there and look at it, give us a report back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| But I'm with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| I mean, we can continue on month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| But if our code is being described as two people in a truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| and every month we're coming back here and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| well, we don't know where this is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| We know there's a problem, but we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Then let's find somebody that can help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| And if this gentleman is having his home going down into the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| because of water problems, because of a golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| what is it going to take to solve that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| And so somebody has to be able to tell us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| Instead of, well, let's look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| Let's write a letter to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| Somebody knows how to fix this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| And I'd like to find out who that person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| And I don't know, maybe we, I know there are engineering firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| I know there are people here that can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| I'm just throwing this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| Somebody has to know how to fix this problem and what we need to do to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| I'm going to try to get back again to the point I was trying to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| and it really goes along with what everyone else has said also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| But particularly that home that's being damaged by the water really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| And it doesn't seem right that someone can build a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| The drainage isn't proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| He just sort of does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| And then the Knox County taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| and an individual who owns a home has to pick up the bill for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Now, it seems like that the person who's causing the damage should be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6036)|
| 1:40:42| It's not a matter of getting a fine of $500 or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| but he caused the damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| He should have to pay to stop the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| And if he's caused damage to the gentleman's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| then he should have to pay to repair that damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| And it's the same thing with Mrs. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| It shouldn't be Knox County that's having to do all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| for damage that someone else has caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| It should be the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| I'm not talking about even enforcing codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| It's the fact that someone caused the damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| They should have to be paying to get it drained properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| And if they caused damage to their creek, it shouldn't be us that's cleaning it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| It should be the person that damaged it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| Because this is Knox County taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| It's basically subsidizing these people that just put something up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| and then they expect us to pick up the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| Or a homeowner or someone that owns a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Mr. Weitrich, when you say that there's nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| and I'm not, by no means am I saying that you're not upholding the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| I think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| And, of course, that's one of our basic problems is our ordinance doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| is not able to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| And that's something for us to take up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| But when we talk about your discretionary powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| and the length of time that we dealt with this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| are you saying that there is nothing, absolutely nothing that you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| that you can do that Knox County can require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| to help the situation of muddy water in Hur Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| I don't, at our last inspection, I'm not aware of any violations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| So to answer your question, I'm not aware of anything else we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| that developer do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| So the owner of lot 17 is who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| I believe it is still owned by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| I don't think that house is sold yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| So you said that lot is sodded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| In fact, I got photographs of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| That means that there are no portions of bare ground on that lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| The only bare portions of ground on that lot are immediately adjacent to the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| where you typically would put in your landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| It's up against the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| So I doubt that that's a contributing factor to what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| So in your estimation, there is no chance that there is sediment laden runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| that is coming none from lot 17 because it's sodded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| I'm not going to say there's no chance that there's any sediment laden water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| coming from that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| All I'm saying is they've got the lot sodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| The only disturbed area is adjacent to the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| So that's not a violation of the Knox County Stormwater Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| They are in compliance with the Knox County Stormwater Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| So when we look at the limits of that property, Mr. Lambert's got a shot of a silt fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6227)|
| 1:44:01| and it's got ponded muddy water around the silt fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| Where can that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| I don't know where that photograph was taken from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| I'm just telling you what I'm aware of on lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| So we can't do anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| Given our ordinance, we cannot require the developer at lot 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| just talking about that lot, there's nothing that we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| I'm not aware of any violations on lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| I just want to get, again, just historically, could you give me an estimate of how many complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| and how much we have required in terms of NOVs for the history of this Graysburg development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6286)|
| 1:44:58| On Graysburg specifically, I can tell you how many we've issued countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| I can find that information out for you, but not stand here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| Do you have any rough estimate of how much in the way of fines that we've levied on Graysburg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6306)|
| 1:45:15| We have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| I do not have it that I can give to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Would you say it's in the thousands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| I wouldn't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| No way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| Well, because I have the information, because it is the number I can find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| I don't want to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| Would you guess at the number of complaints that we've had about Graysburg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| Here again, and I'm not trying to be evasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| It's just that I'm not going to be aware of every single complaint that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| I mean, we literally get dozens of phone calls on a weekly basis about drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| I don't hear every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| These are numbers I can get for you, but standing here, I cannot provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| I'd like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| I'd like a summary report on Graysburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Could you do that for us for next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| I'd like to ask, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| if we could move on with the ordinance that we have to deal with on page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| We've got people in the audience, I believe, that are concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| And I'd like to, we can sit here and banter all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| but I'd like for the people that are here on this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| we could go ahead and debate that if you don't care, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| Well, that item you're talking about can't be heard until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| I checked on it before the commission meeting even started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6388)|
| 1:46:37| Is there any more discussion on Ms. Cole's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| If not, moving on to discussion item regarding the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| Do that little thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6412)|
| 1:47:03| Discussion regarding MPC and development considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| Finance, 10-0 to send to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| Six-0 to send on to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Now, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| In early December, Commissioner Briggs and Shouse and I heard Trey Benefield, the current chairman of the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6440)|
| 1:47:28| talk at the Council of West Knox County Homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| and he did a wonderful review of past development, not specific developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| but development practices, and then began to look to the future, to the next 15 or 20 years in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| And the three of us thought it was sufficiently interesting and should be shared with this entire commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| So I've asked Trey to come and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| He has been the chair for two years and I understand concludes his term this next MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| Last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| And counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| He, I think, has tried to conduct the affairs of the commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| in a thorough and a listening manner, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| And I hope you will give your attention to Mr. Benefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| and perhaps we can learn something about the future of development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Thank you for coming, Trey, and thank you for being so patient as we got to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| And I appreciate you all patiently addressing the issues of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| I've sat in your seats and I know how tedious it can become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| And the thoroughness, I think you all ought to be commended for taking the time to really study these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6514)|
| 1:48:42| and discuss them and run them to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Our discussions have gotten more lengthy on the planning commission lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| and I think we do better business that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| I think it's a good thing that you all do take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| and thoroughly address the issues that are before the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| To talk about the future of planning, I think we'll start by looking back at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6538)|
| 1:49:04| You know, planning is something that we've been doing for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| In the Bible it says that man should take dominion over the earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| and it goes on with specific instructions from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| But that gives a history of how long people have been trying to dominate their world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| You look at the Egyptians, the arrangement of the pyramids had some order to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| and it had some cosmic order related to the alignment of the stars or whatever else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| But it speaks to the fact that people want to manipulate the earth to their liking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6568)|
| 1:49:35| We move forward to the city of Rome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| 628 B.C. is the first evidence of analysis of the need for agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| and transportation in planning out cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| And you look at Rome today, it appears to still be functioning fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| So that's some validity for the work of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| More recently though, in talking about what drives the type of planning we do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6595)|
| 1:50:02| if we look at the late 1800s and early 1900s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| the tenement construction in New York City was so dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| The group of people were so tight in that area around heavy industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6610)|
| 1:50:18| that New York City developed the first comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| It was called the New York City Zone Building Resolution of 1916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| So that's the beginning of the kind of planning that we do today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| that affects what we're doing here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| And more importantly, in Ohio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| there was a realty company called the Ambler Realty Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| that was pushing industrial development in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| that it encroached on existing residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| And through the arguments between the city of Euclid in Ohio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| and the Ambler Realty Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| it went to the Supreme Court and validated the concept of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| And this is the law that we practice zoning under today here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| Now, in these early contexts of industry encroaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| on established residences of high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| in proximity to noxious and dangerous activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| zoning was very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| We look today at what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| and we have these long, protracted discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| over 3.6 units per acre versus 3.8 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| and it's a far cry from the dramatic zoning implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6684)|
| 1:51:31| that we've had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| So I think that what I'm trying to say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| that some of the rules that we've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| have led to a perversion of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| And we all made these rules, and we all zoned these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| we meaning the Planning Commission and you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| But we need to be aware that it's probably time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| for another revolution in the thought of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| and we're starting to see the glimpses of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| and we'll talk about that here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| You know, you look at the rules that we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| and, you know, I feel for Mr. Weitrick here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| He's following all the rules, and best I can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| the developer was probably following all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| The grass, you know, the place is sodded and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| but we have a situation that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| It's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| Drive down Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Everything that was built on Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| was built by following the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| When we put all those rules in place one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| is Clinton Highway the vision that we had in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| for the best our community could be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| You know, we just need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| All these rules that we build, they'll have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| I think I heard somebody use the term earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| What do you consider wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Let him finish, and then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| Go ahead. What do you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| Sir, you know, and I appreciate planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| but I live on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| and out there we're very proud of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| and it may not be as nice as the gated subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| that you live in, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| but the people that own property up and down that highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| what is going in out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| is what the demographics will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| Now, the demographics of our area are raising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| and so are the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| that are located in that area, sir, are raising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| We have got fine restaurants now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| We have fine shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| Can I talk for a second, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| I'm not talking about what was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| What I'm talking about is the extent of paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| the exclusivity of one land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| There's only commercial for miles and miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| and miles down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| What it requires is it's a very inefficient use of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| What we've got is vast areas of residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| and over here vast areas of commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| and there's no place for industry in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| That's the problem that I'm trying to point to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| When you drive down Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| you see flashy signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| You see, you know, a whole lot of pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| and a whole lot of lights on your face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| It works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| I'm not going to say that economically it doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| but it's not the most efficient way to build a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| Well, I mean, it's within that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| the businesses that are located there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| and there are mixed uses that are being planned in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| I know down on Beaver Creek Drive there's some mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| and I'm fully supportive of mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| But, you know, I understand your neighborhood, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| and you go down to Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| and you see those wonderful condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| that are built just off of the Turkey Creek shopping area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| Those are modern developments built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| Condos at Turkey Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Well, there's, yeah, back in the cove in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| there's a condo's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Or those puds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Those are small but very nice houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| Yeah, that's barely mixed use if you're talking about Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| At any rate, I apologize if I insulted you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| when I talked about it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| Well, I mean, you pick on my area and you insult it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| Commissioner Labrador, let him finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| All right, so this is what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| No, you started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| You said let him come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| I should have known better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| Okay, so the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| The first thing I'd like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| is that communities all across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| are wrestling with what they've built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6922)|
| 1:55:28| and how they're planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| versus quality in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| I had the opportunity a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| to go to Europe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| and the towns in Europe address zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| very differently than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| I think the big thing is that Europe was primarily built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| before the advent of the automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| and our country was mostly built after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| so we built on a vehicular scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| They mix uses very comfortably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| When you see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| I don't think that at any time I was in Europe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| I was out of walking distance of basic commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| out of distance of a pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| For that matter, I think I was pretty close to a bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| almost all the time I was in Europe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| and it was comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| It can be done in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| and having these uses mixed into your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| do not detract from the community in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| Some of the things that we're going to have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| we're going to have to come to terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| with our environmental policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| Our air quality is abysmal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| It's absolutely a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Last year, we were eighth worst in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| and that is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| When I hear on the radio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| not to go outside on one of these warm summer days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| because air quality is unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| I find that completely unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| Similarly, the water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| like the issue that we were just hearing about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| that Commissioner Armstrong spoke so eloquently about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| that's a factor that we need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| We need to address our water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| As I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| we need to find some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| to integrate industry into our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| We don't, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| you all wrestle with the budget as much as anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| I don't think we generate enough tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| off of all the residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| that we've built in the last 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| to support the schools and the other infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| and the parks and the other infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| that we're going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| We need to have things that generate more tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| and we need to integrate these things comfortably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| into what we've already got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| We have developed subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| on 35.7 square miles, I think, of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| in the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| If we were to do that another 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| I think we would pretty much be out of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| definitely the most suitable land for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| So that's why you see a lot of these things coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| about the hillside and slopeside task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| because we're being pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| into the more difficult land to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| I think there's going to be some evolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| I think that the residential market is going to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| As Commissioner Lambert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| smaller houses are becoming more popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| even in the very high ends of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| Multifamily is going to continue to become more popular too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| I think that the economy is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| People are going to want to spend less on their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| And they're probably going to want to drive less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| So I think our transportation infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| is going to be very differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| I think that in the next 10 to 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| we're going to stop building subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| the gated community that you referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| which, by the way, I do not live in a gated community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| Those communities of 10,000 square foot houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| I don't think we're going to build subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| full of houses that are that big on into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| I don't think that's a sustainable fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| neither economically nor environmentally nor socially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| I think that that is going to have to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| And I think that we need to be aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| in the planning that we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| There is some good news in our community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| You know, as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| what I'm seeing is that people are getting better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| about asking for what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| When I first started on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| there was a zoning code in these sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| and very small participation in the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| But what we're seeing now is people participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| in small area plans like the South Knox Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| like Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| and also these other things that are coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| like I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| the Ridge Slope and Hillside Protection Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| These are efforts of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| to ask for what they want and help define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| what community we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| for the next 10 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| Along with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| we're seeing the transfer of development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| we're seeing form-based codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| and we're also working on a set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| of sustainable development incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| So this is the evolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| that I think is going to change our zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| I think the form-based codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| are going to be very significant on into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| So you guys just asked me to give you all a heads-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| as to what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| I do apologize for insulting your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| I didn't mean to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| What I said was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| Sir, we have a piece of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| My father and my uncle have a piece of property...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| I've been hearing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| ...out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| That is perfect for mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| That has been the whole plan all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| And now you want to propose...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| I'm not proposing anything today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| ...regulations that would render it totally without value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| I'm not proposing anything today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| If you had a blank canvas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| take Alcoa Highway, Kingston Pike, anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| blank, nothing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| and you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| this is what we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| what would it look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Would it look like it turned out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| Did our rules accomplish what we wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| Well, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| we don't have a blank canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| You can't erase everything that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| And in Europe...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| And, sir, I've traveled all over Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| In Europe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| they didn't start with a blank canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| It evolved over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Now, if you look at the American culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| that we enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| and yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| it's going to have to alter somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| We had a large mass of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| and we spread out to fill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| Houses have been bigger in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Cars have been bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| If you even look at the way our motorcycles are designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| the Harley-Davidson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| the all-American machine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| is designed to go long distances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| on big stretches of open road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| whereas the European-style motorcycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| are for twisting and winding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| around very short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| fast trips on winding roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| because those roads evolved from cart paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| from ancient civilizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| And yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| as their population density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| and as their economy changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| we are going to gravitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| whether through planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| or rather through simple economic evolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| we are going to gravitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| toward more mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| And myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| I live on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| I live a half of a mile from my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| I am certainly a proponent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| of the style of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| that you're suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| And I think that over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| Americans will naturally gravitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| But that doesn't mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| that our forefathers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| back when the roads were open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| and there was lots of space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| to expand into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| that doesn't mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| that they were wrong, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| It means that they had the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| to grow into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| And had they had that in Germany,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| had they had that in England,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| I would challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| that they would have probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7346)|

| 2:02:29| But to pick one area of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| and we are just on our upward swing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| at starting to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| I know when we first bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| property on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| it was nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| but redneck beer joints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| And it's changed significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| and it will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| to change significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| But it's nothing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| with that area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| It's nothing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| with the type of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| that live on that area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| It is quite simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| the economics of the times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| and now that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| is more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| So instead of little redneck dives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| you're seeing Ruby Tuesdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7381)|

| 2:03:06| we're probably going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-two?start=7386)|
