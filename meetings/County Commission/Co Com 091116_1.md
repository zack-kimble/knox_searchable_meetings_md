| 2:46:10| I'm going to have to limit each one of you to about two or three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9970)|
| 2:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9978)|
| 2:46:19| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| My name is Mike Mitchell, PO Box 23466 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| The process is the problem, and there is no process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| We want you to abstain today because you don't have any information to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| We're talking about the land cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| We have no idea what the total cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| Manvilla was $122,000 per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| They suggest they want 400 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| 400 times 122,000 is $49 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| We wish to be part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| We want you to send a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| This was fast-tracked, and the disclosure was completely inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10014)|
| 2:46:58| They said that this was for housing for the chronically homeless that were disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10018)|
| 2:47:04| But after the fact, we learned that disabled actually means mentally ill and or drug-addicted and or alcohol-addicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10024)|
| 2:47:12| We were told last Thursday we have no say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10032)|
| 2:47:17| We want you to send a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| Abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| That will send a message that we do have a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10042)|
| 2:47:26| I'd be happy if you vote no, but if you abstain, there's a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10046)|
| 2:47:31| You don't have the information to make a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10051)|
| 2:47:34| If you cost this project according to Mr. Lawler's figures, it's a $3.25 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10054)|
| 2:47:41| It's $140,000 a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| That's incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| Here on Sharp Lane, we can do the same thing for $25,900 a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10066)|
| 2:47:52| That's 411 Sharp Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10072)|
| 2:47:54| On Tillery Road, we've got a unit that comes down to $18,000 a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10074)|
| 2:48:03| If we really care about helping the mentally ill, we would want to have more units for the same money to do a greater good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10083)|
| 2:48:14| Please send a message today that this type of fast track will not be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10094)|
| 2:48:19| and please hold public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| The people have not spoken to whether we want this scattered approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10101)|
| 2:48:26| I honestly don't understand why we are not having a renaissance at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10106)|
| 2:48:32| Take some of that park land, build a building, solve the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| and we won't have to go through this for every single neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| There's a better way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| Let's help the less fortunate, and let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| The median house price in this county is $133,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| These little apartments cost $7,000 more than the median house price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| We, the taxpayers, are asking you to send a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| Vote no or abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10138)|
| 2:48:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10139)|
| 2:49:00| I'll go if no one else will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10140)|
| 2:49:14| She can go after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| Michael Cabbage, 10612 Summit Mountain Court, 37922, and I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10155)|
| 2:49:21| These gentlemen over here made it quite clear the other night we didn't have a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10161)|
| 2:49:25| We have no right to tell you how to spend our taxpayer money no matter what the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| And let me just say, as an attorney, for 10 years I've done criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10170)|
| 2:49:35| The majority of my criminal defense is court-appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10175)|
| 2:49:38| And if I hear one more time how we're going to give them a house and a check and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10178)|
| 2:49:44| and they're not going to commit crime, I'm going to vomit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| Every day I'm in the courthouse, I represent court-appointed indigent clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| who have a free place to stay, who get food stamps, who do not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10190)|
| 2:49:54| They live off our dime, and they still commit crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| I love the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| That's why I do criminal defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10198)|
| 2:49:59| But don't tell me just because we're going to put them in my house they're not going to commit crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| or that I don't represent homeless people every day committing crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10202)|
| 2:50:06| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10206)|
| 2:50:07| So I'd appreciate it if you would actually tell the truth about that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10207)|
| 2:50:10| And I would urge you to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10210)|
| 2:50:20| A lot of the issues I was wanting to bring up were addressed by Mr. Lambert and Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10220)|
| 2:50:26| I really commend them for the things that they addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10226)|
| 2:50:29| But all I want to say is, first of all, I'd like to say that I totally respect homeless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10229)|
| 2:50:38| and I support them 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| As a matter of fact, I send a donation in every month to the Knox County Rescue Mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10240)|
| 2:50:46| My husband and I were foster parents for 16 years for foster children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10246)|
| 2:50:51| Some were teenagers with drug addiction, alcohol addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| and we helped them straighten their lives out so they could be better adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10254)|
| 2:51:01| So I have nothing against homeless people, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| But I do have a problem with the location that they're wanting to build this apartment complex in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10264)|
| 2:51:11| Number one, I just can't see jumping on the first location you find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| I just can't understand that, for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| So I just really believe they should look around more before they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10277)|
| 2:51:22| Another problem I have is building, and I'm like the fellow that just spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| building a homeless place right next to a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| I mean, that's temptation for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| That's not a way for them to rehabilitate when they've got a liquor store two minutes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10294)|
| 2:51:40| And also, they're building it right in the middle of a neighborhood, which I grew up in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10300)|
| 2:51:45| and most all of the residents in that neighborhood are elderly people, my mother included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10305)|
| 2:51:51| and they like to walk in their neighborhood and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10311)|
| 2:51:54| And when you put, you know, an apartment complex full of homeless people right next to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10314)|
| 2:52:00| they're going to be sitting there, they're going to be bored, they're not going to have automobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10320)|
| 2:52:04| and they're going to be out walking and looking for something to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10324)|
| 2:52:08| And I just don't think it's right to put them right on top of these elderly people that have lived there all their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| And also, in the apartments there next to the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10334)|
| 2:52:18| I know for a fact there are women that live in those apartments whose husbands work night shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10338)|
| 2:52:24| and that's not going to be safe for them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10344)|
| 2:52:27| So I just think not only should they look at other locations instead of jumping on the first thing they see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| I think that they shouldn't build right on top of a subdivision with these people that are going to be vulnerable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10353)|
| 2:52:39| But I do believe that there's help for these people because we've helped foster children to, you know, resolve their problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10359)|
| 2:52:47| But I just don't think that they should build on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| I just am totally against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| And like I said, and yes, there's a homeless problem in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10372)|
| 2:52:58| I've lived there all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| I get tired of getting off the interstate at Lovell Road and Campbell Station and people standing there wanting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10380)|
| 2:53:05| We'll work for food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| So there is a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| But look at other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10388)|
| 2:53:09| There's land all over Knox County, everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| I mean, don't stick them right in the middle of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| I mean, that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10395)|
| 2:53:16| So I just, like I said, I really like what Mr. Hammond and Mr. Lambert spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10396)|
| 2:53:22| They just about said it all for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10404)|
| 2:53:25| Ma'am, I need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| Patty Lee, 11108 Hewland Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10412)|
| 2:53:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| I think I saw a couple more hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10417)|
| 2:53:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to address the Knox County Commission regarding the permanent supportive housing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10421)|
| 2:53:48| For the record, my name is John Randall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| and I live at 10625 Summit Mountain Court, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10431)|
| 2:53:57| I live within one mile of the proposed location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| I am a retired Air Force full colonel, spent 28 years on active duty, and I have lived in Knox County since 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10440)|
| 2:54:10| My first two years of active duty were with the United States Marine Corps enlisted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| I learned three very important lessons there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| First of all, I did not like mud and mosquitoes, and that's why I switched to the Air Force for the next 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10457)|
| 2:54:24| But secondly, I learned that honesty and integrity can never be compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| And thirdly, I learned that for a mission to be accomplished, the leader must have the trust of the people he is leading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10469)|
| 2:54:38| It takes a while to build this trust, but you can destroy it in a heartbeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10478)|
| 2:54:43| I'll now focus the rest of my comments on this trust issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| At the information meeting last week, I had the privilege of being the first citizen to ask questions following the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10487)|
| 2:54:55| I asked two simple and direct questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| For the record, I asked that the citizens be provided with the criteria that were being used for site selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10498)|
| 2:55:05| and then I asked for the identification of the alternative sites that were considered and their evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10505)|
| 2:55:13| Both of these questions are fundamental to assessing whether or not any proposed site is in fact the best site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10513)|
| 2:55:21| The only answer that was given was that the information I requested could not and would not be made public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10521)|
| 2:55:30| This immediately raises the specter of smoke and mirrors and snake oil salesmen and does nothing to build trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10530)|
| 2:55:38| I would like to believe that the Permanent Supportive Housing Program is the appropriate solution to Knox County's chronic homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10538)|
| 2:55:47| I understand the architecture calls for a distributed program with smaller units in a large number of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10547)|
| 2:55:54| distributed throughout the county to avoid the issues of large complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10554)|
| 2:55:59| But the simple arithmetic associated with the 400 to 800 chronic homeless indicates that we are going to need 16 to maybe as many as 32 site locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10559)|
| 2:56:12| Total cost, $18, $25, $30 million federal funds with additional funds coming from the community for the logistics support of those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10572)|
| 2:56:25| Consequently, I believe it is essential that all proposed locations be identified up front along with the alternative sites that were considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10585)|
| 2:56:35| and not selected so that the citizens can see what the proposed locations are and that they are in fact the best locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10595)|
| 2:56:45| It is my understanding that it is the program's goal to provide homes for the chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10605)|
| 2:56:52| I would submit that unless the locations are accepted by the immediate neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10612)|
| 2:56:58| then the residents will never be part of that community and they will not be removed from the chronically homeless roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10618)|
| 2:57:07| It is clear to me that the citizens attending last week's meeting were not convinced that this location is the best location in District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10627)|
| 2:57:17| It is also clear to me, gentlemen, that this part of Knox County's government has lost the trust of its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10637)|
| 2:57:25| If a good salesman can sell a refrigerator to an Eskimo, and they do have Eskimo refrigerators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10645)|
| 2:57:31| it should not be an impossible task for the Permanent Supportive Housing Team to sell this project to the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10651)|
| 2:57:38| but it will require open and transparent and fully accountable processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10658)|
| 2:57:45| At this time, I have no reason to believe that the site selection process was thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10665)|
| 2:57:52| I've done a cursory review of the Knox GIS database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10672)|
| 2:57:55| and I have found other properties with suitable locations in District 5 that, as far as I know, were not even considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10675)|
| 2:58:04| I would ask that the Commission terminate this particular piecemeal approach to the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10684)|
| 2:58:10| and develop an open, integrated solution identifying all proposed locations in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10690)|
| 2:58:17| While it is true that an elephant is easier to eat one piece at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10697)|
| 2:58:22| gentlemen, ladies, I want to make sure it's an elephant that I'm eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10702)|
| 2:58:27| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10707)|
| 2:58:34| I think I saw one more hand up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10714)|
| 2:58:40| Hello, my name is Joe Ferrari, 12632 Distant View Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10720)|
| 2:58:46| I apologize for not knowing a lot of people up here, but I'm pretty new to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| I just want to make a few comments real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| First, I'm not against helping people who are homeless, but I do have a question on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10732)|
| 2:58:57| I know a lot of the people to the left here said they have full faith in the criteria that was used to pick out the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10737)|
| 2:59:06| I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10746)|
| 2:59:09| Nothing against you individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| However, it is a dead-end street, and having a neighbor who has had chronic problems with drugs and alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10751)|
| 2:59:18| I turn to her for advice since I have never had those problems and hopefully, God bless, never will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10758)|
| 2:59:25| Again, it's a dead-end street, and the first building that these people will be forced to walk by every day is an alcohol store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10765)|
| 2:59:32| either leaving the premises or coming home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| I would think being on a dead-end street with a liquor establishment on the corner would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10774)|
| 2:59:39| for these individuals who are chronically homeless due to drugs and alcohol, would perhaps exclude that criteria alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10779)|
| 2:59:47| Certainly, we would not house sex addicts next to a store that sold pornography or a strip club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10787)|
| 2:59:54| It just seems to be common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10794)|
| 2:59:59| The second thing I will ask is, these are 23 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| One thing that certainly happens with any program that is implemented, be it through government or through privately owned entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| is unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| I know there's been talk about the daycare and the liquor store and even the lot itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10812)|
| 3:00:18| My child goes to Kitty Cottage 3, for all full disclosure, which is not the establishment which is in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10818)|
| 3:00:24| I can say, however, had he gone to Kitty Cottage 2, I certainly would pull my child from the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10824)|
| 3:00:31| I have to question how many other parents will do the same once this has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| I moved from New York and New Jersey to Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| I could have moved anywhere in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| I chose the great state of Tennessee because I thought it was a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| Within Tennessee, I could have moved to Knoxville, Nashville, and Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| After touring all three of them, I chose Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| Obviously, I could have chose east, west, north, or south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| I chose West Knoxville due to its great community as well as just the feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10854)|
| 3:01:00| I thought it was a good place to raise my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| I would certainly say that many parents will pull their kids from this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| So you'll be helping 23 individuals who desperately need help, and I don't doubt that we should help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10867)|
| 3:01:13| We will certainly then be putting at least 20 people out of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10873)|
| 3:01:17| People who probably live paycheck to paycheck don't make as good of a living as I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10877)|
| 3:01:21| They could not afford to lose their jobs even for a week or a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10881)|
| 3:01:25| I beg of you to bear that in mind as well, and please vote no for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10885)|
| 3:01:31| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10891)|
| 3:01:40| I think that takes care of the individuals from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10900)|
| 3:01:46| Deborah Van Meter, 8700 Darien Court, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10906)|
| 3:01:52| I'm not going to specifically address this site, but I had a couple of questions that I hope will be considered in your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10912)|
| 3:01:59| and in future decisions about properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10919)|
| 3:02:02| I did quite a bit of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| There were a lot of listings online about various organizations, various ideas and concepts about affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10924)|
| 3:02:14| The Vet Life Foundation 2006 Awards for Excellence in Affordable Housing had numerous award-winning locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10934)|
| 3:02:26| And what seems to be a recurring theme is on-site services available for the prior homeless individuals once they are housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10946)|
| 3:02:39| I think having 24-hour awake service has been mentioned, and I think having a caseworker on-site has been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10959)|
| 3:02:50| But these other facilities are including things such as, let's see, residents are required to develop life goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10970)|
| 3:03:00| and plans to spend 40 hours each week working or learning with the goal of achieving self-sufficiency by the end of their stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10980)|
| 3:03:08| Life skills, education, counseling, and other services to non-resident families in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| that might be appealing for other non-residents to come into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=10993)|
| 3:03:22| Let's see, refurbishing vacant properties and improving deserted or run-down areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11002)|
| 3:03:30| not necessarily because this is the best site to locate prior homeless individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11010)|
| 3:03:38| but because the people in this area may be interested in public adult education classes, computer classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11018)|
| 3:03:47| possibly incorporating other services such as shops, grocery stores, restaurants, soup kitchens, libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11027)|
| 3:03:55| Other things on-site I think have been listed overall as why these are award-winning public housing endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11035)|
| 3:04:06| Beyond that, I looked three and a half years for my current home, and I'm glad I took the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11046)|
| 3:04:12| So I do appreciate things taking time to find the best fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11052)|
| 3:04:18| And also, I would like to see the current two projects that are being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11058)|
| 3:04:22| the Menville Manor and the Finnegan Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11062)|
| 3:04:27| I'd like to see how these 50 roundabout individuals are able to do not, well, the Menville Manor is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11067)|
| 3:04:38| but the one that is not right there adjacent to the majority of these folks' needs and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11078)|
| 3:04:45| I'd like to see how that would handle the situation prior to forcing another fast turnaround of purchase and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11085)|
| 3:04:54| Let's see what happens first in some of the existing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11094)|
| 3:04:58| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11100)|
| 3:05:06| We'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer to the next meeting, to the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11108)|
| 3:05:15| I presume we're going to have to have a roll call vote starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11115)|
| 3:05:20| I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11120)|
| 3:05:22| Amy, was that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11122)|
| 3:05:24| Can you explain why you want to, I mean, is it just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11124)|
| 3:05:28| Yeah, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| There are some concerns that this was perhaps fast-tracked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11130)|
| 3:05:35| although I feel like they've been looking for property in West Knoxville for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11135)|
| 3:05:43| But that would address that concern, give more time for public comment if people feel that they've not been heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11143)|
| 3:05:52| It would also give an opportunity to get a certified appraisal so that we know exactly what we're talking about when we say market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11152)|
| 3:06:01| We would know exactly what we're talking about so that people are saying they don't want to vote because they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11161)|
| 3:06:08| or they're not going to vote for it because they don't know exactly how much we're talking about when we say fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| Well, a certified appraisal will give us that number and we would know exactly what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| so we could make our decision based on more information rather than less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11178)|
| 3:06:27| Those were the two main reasons that I was looking to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| The question I've got is, John, I'm not going to vote for this site where this site is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11191)|
| 3:06:37| but if it's going to give you people time to go out and look, like Commissioner Hammond has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11197)|
| 3:06:42| other people have made offers and stuff like that, I don't care to give you guys a little bit of time to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11202)|
| 3:06:47| but for this particular site, I am not going to vote for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11207)|
| 3:06:51| We don't have to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| Do you have something, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| My question is on this, Amy, is this, with what you're doing, are they just going to look at this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11215)|
| 3:07:00| or are they going to be looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| Well, the thing is, is that this is not just one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11222)|
| 3:07:05| This is an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11225)|
| 3:07:08| They're going to continue looking for more sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11228)|
| 3:07:11| I mean, because we've got to build a lot of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| so they're going to keep looking for more sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| It doesn't just stop with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11235)|
| 3:07:17| So that's an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11237)|
| 3:07:22| I do want to make a couple of points about some things that I've heard that I find really disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11242)|
| 3:07:31| There is no evidence that permanent supportive housing or residents of permanent supportive housing damage property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11251)|
| 3:07:43| There is no evidence that they are dangerous to children or to seniors or to single women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11263)|
| 3:07:51| There is no evidence that permanent supportive housing has a negative effect on surrounding businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11271)|
| 3:07:59| Mr. Chairman, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11279)|
| 3:08:00| We're talking about the delay, not the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11280)|
| 3:08:04| I just wanted to get that information out there because we keep coming around to the same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11284)|
| 3:08:10| Do you have something, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| Yes, just one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11292)|
| 3:08:15| Delaying this 30 days is not going to be able to address the questions that have come up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11295)|
| 3:08:22| There is absolutely no way that can be done in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11312)|
| 3:08:33| To delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11313)|
| 3:08:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11318)|
| 3:08:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11319)|
| 3:08:40| Commissioner Strickland votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11320)|
| 3:08:41| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11321)|
| 3:08:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11322)|
| 3:08:43| Commissioner Mark Harmon votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11325)|
| 3:08:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11326)|
| 3:08:47| Commissioner Burroughs votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11327)|
| 3:08:48| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11328)|
| 3:08:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11329)|
| 3:08:50| Commissioner Norman votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11330)|
| 3:08:51| Commissioner Ivan Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11332)|
| 3:08:53| Commissioner Ivan Harman votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11335)|

| 3:12:18| Yeah, this is just the, if you all read the background to the resolution, you know, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11538)|
| 3:12:30| about providing decals for all vehicles that, other than those that are involved in official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11550)|
| 3:12:39| use type slash investigation type activities, and so just think this is a good idea, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11559)|
| 3:12:50| would make a motion for its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11570)|

| 3:12:59| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11580)|
| 3:13:01| What kind of decal are we talking about now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| You know, we discussed it about the small one, and the department's paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11582)|
| 3:13:07| Okay, the decal, the public works department said that they could provide a decal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11587)|
| 3:13:14| minimal cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11594)|
| 3:13:15| It was, you know, stick-on size for minimal cost, and it would be on the driver's side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11595)|
| 3:13:24| and passenger side door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| What is minimal cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| It was about 50 cents a piece, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| That was for the small one, but now he's talking about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11611)|
| 3:13:34| No, I'm talking about, you know, that standard size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| It's still going to be 50 cents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| Well, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11619)|
| 3:13:40| It's 50 cents to a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| I don't know what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11621)|
| 3:13:42| Okay, well, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11622)|
| 3:13:43| But not over a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| It's not expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| The permanent decal that's painted on is an expensive item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11627)|
| 3:13:52| This is not an expensive item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11634)|
| 3:13:55| Well, it's 50 cents, like Commissioner Harmon said, but it could be a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| It's $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| It's $250-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| It couldn't be much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11642)|
| 3:14:05| How about the numbers on the cars haven't changed yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| It's still $250, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| On the number of cars that it would apply to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| I don't know what the exact number of cars is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| I thought we had about $250 there to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| Do we have anybody that can answer those questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| Anybody from the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11663)|
| 3:14:27| You know, our money is tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11667)|
| 3:14:28| We don't need to get into something that's going to run for $30 or $40 or $50 a car is what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11668)|
| 3:14:32| No, I think this is going to be a matter of less than a dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| and there's a minimal number of cars that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| Mr. Van de Beek, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11679)|
| 3:14:40| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11680)|
| 3:14:42| Mr. Pinkston, I don't have exact numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11682)|
| 3:14:44| but I can tell you that in the executive branch the number of vehicles that are street legal is 255.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11684)|
| 3:14:50| Of those 255, a significant number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11690)|

| 3:15:02| the heavy panel trucks in Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| all those vehicles are already marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| I would just off the cuff ballpark this as affecting no more than 40 or 50 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11707)|
| 3:15:15| Okay, that's even less than I believe what you thought the last time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11715)|
| 3:15:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| And just in anticipation of commission action on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| I know Bruce has already been checking to make sure that the majority of his fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11722)|
| 3:15:28| even the smaller vehicles, are marked, and the vast, vast majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| I think Doug Patel only had two or three vehicles in his fleet that were already in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11732)|
| 3:15:36| I think you said that even included the heavy equipment and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11736)|
| 3:15:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11740)|
| 3:15:41| Okay, I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11741)|
| 3:15:42| I already made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11742)|
| 3:15:44| I'll make a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11744)|
| 3:15:45| Second, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11749)|
| 3:15:50| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11750)|
| 3:15:53| Are these automobiles, do they all have government license tags on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11753)|
| 3:15:57| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11757)|
| 3:16:01| As far as I know, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11761)|
| 3:16:04| That's a possible exception to the undercover vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11764)|
| 3:16:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| Commissioner Littlefield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11769)|
| 3:16:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| Is this going back to the policy we had before we wrote the new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11774)|
| 3:16:19| It's basically the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11779)|
| 3:16:20| That's what I provided Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11780)|
| 3:16:22| I haven't seen the final results yet, so I don't know if it varies from that significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11782)|
| 3:16:27| But what I provided Commissioner Norman was the old policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11787)|
| 3:16:31| which did have detailed marking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| and then three or four potential exceptions in the new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11794)|
| 3:16:39| My understanding is this is simply amending the new policy to incorporate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11802)|
| 3:16:43| We used the old policy, and we amended that old policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11806)|
| 3:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| Do we have something else from Commissioner Pinkerton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| Oh, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| Yeah, I think this is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| I supported it when it first came up, and I think it's an awesome idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11816)|
| 3:17:00| One question I did have is for security purposes, did we exempt the mayor's personal vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11820)|
| 3:17:07| The language says the exemptions apply to official business slash investigations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11827)|
| 3:17:14| for the purpose of investigating fraud, abuse, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11834)|
| 3:17:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11840)|
| 3:17:21| Let me ask Dwight, do you see my concern where we may want to exempt the mayor's car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11841)|
| 3:17:30| and does the mayor share those concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11853)|
| 3:17:34| The old policy did provide an exemption for the elected official and senior directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11854)|
| 3:17:40| That may have been removed in the iteration that Commissioner Norman has got before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11860)|
| 3:17:47| We would ask that the mayor's car, certainly at least for the balance of this mayor's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11867)|
| 3:17:52| be exempted since that's the prior and established practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11872)|
| 3:17:55| and then if it's a matter the commission wanted to revisit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| you'll have a new mayor in a matter of less than a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11877)|
| 3:18:01| and the entire matter might come back under discussion at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11881)|
| 3:18:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11885)|
| 3:18:06| Tony, how do you feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11886)|
| 3:18:08| I mean, I don't necessarily think that we need to make a large loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11888)|
| 3:18:12| that anybody can say this is my senior staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11892)|
| 3:18:15| but how would you feel about just one exemption and that be the mayor's personal vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11895)|
| 3:18:22| I think the way that the resolution reads, it allows that latitude for the mayor already as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11902)|
| 3:18:31| as well as some other directors, I mean senior staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11911)|
| 3:18:35| You know, Doug Battelle, if he wants to check up on parks and rec people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11915)|
| 3:18:41| he doesn't want to go out with a marked car, and so that's a reasonable exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11921)|
| 3:18:46| So that's available to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11926)|
| 3:18:48| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=11931)|

| 3:20:50| I think we meant to send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12050)|
| 3:20:54| I think it was just on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12054)|
| 3:20:56| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12056)|
| 3:20:57| We approved to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| We approved to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12059)|
| 3:21:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12060)|

| 3:21:02| That's what we approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12062)|
| 3:21:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| Let's see who's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12070)|
| 3:21:12| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12072)|
| 3:21:13| Can I speak to you a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| Because you're the guy with the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| The other Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| Which Chris is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12079)|
| 3:21:20| Chris Bronson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| Oh, wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| Sorry, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| Wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| You were ahead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12086)|
| 3:21:29| You had me confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12089)|
| 3:21:32| Basically, what I really want to discuss tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12092)|
| 3:21:35| in our previous meetings, especially a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12095)|
| 3:21:39| rather than the ones where we've been talking about all these sidebar issues of stormwater committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12099)|
| 3:21:45| and stormwater revisions and stormwater review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| we had the major theme at one time running through all of our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12107)|
| 3:21:53| And County Commission agreed to use this kind of as the poster child of what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12113)|
| 3:21:58| how we're going to do it, and demonstrate what we're going to do and how we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12118)|
| 3:22:03| At the same time, I believe the mayor was in agreement that we needed to do something about lower coast property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12123)|
| 3:22:10| At that time, I think we brought out other people to analyze it, other people to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12130)|
| 3:22:15| We've gone from a state where it was in bad shape to no shape to maybe we're not sure what kind of shape it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12135)|
| 3:22:24| But the bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12144)|
| 3:22:25| We've had notices of violation out there on that property by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12145)|
| 3:22:29| The state has said that because of the construction problems out there, we have sediment in the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12149)|
| 3:22:36| And they have corrective actions that were recommended to the developers several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12156)|
| 3:22:41| I think the fifth one was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| I think County Commission has agreed, at least in our earlier discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12163)|
| 3:22:48| that we needed to take a look at and remediation as to what we're going to do with lower coast property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12168)|
| 3:22:56| and how we're going to get it fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| And this is, as Commissioner Norman just said, this is going to be coming up every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12179)|
| 3:23:05| What I would hope to do and what I'm requesting and what I hope we can discuss, if we need some help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12185)|
| 3:23:12| is how we're going to cure this, what's our implementation strategy, and when is it going to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12192)|
| 3:23:18| Those are the real three questions I wanted to ask you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12198)|
| 3:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12204)|
| 3:23:25| Well, I don't have an answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| I think that having the person from the Tennessee Stream Mitigation Program look at the stream and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12207)|
| 3:23:37| hey, this stream is actually in the process of recovering from years of being used as a farm stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12217)|
| 3:23:46| basically years of being subjected to runoff from agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12226)|
| 3:23:51| And the apparent effects of the development are minimal in relation to the overall stream morphology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12231)|
| 3:24:00| That's the word used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12240)|
| 3:24:04| It's sort of a head scratcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12244)|
| 3:24:06| We expected to find something that would probably be a little more exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| They would say that the stream was severely impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| and that there were certain measures that would be required in certain areas that would need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12254)|
| 3:24:21| At the same time, we've continued to be vigilant with inspections and enforcement on construction sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12261)|
| 3:24:28| We've issued several notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12268)|
| 3:24:32| We've had several of the properties that drain towards that stream come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12272)|
| 3:24:41| Yet, I believe last week in the heavy rains, I think it was Tuesday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12281)|
| 3:24:47| I believe that there was some muddy runoff reported in the stream from Ms. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12287)|
| 3:24:53| Some of that, I think, is the nature of the land, the fact that some water runs onto the property that's discolored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12293)|
| 3:25:02| and some water runs off the property and goes underground and resurfaces discolored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12302)|
| 3:25:10| So the solution may come out of this effort with the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12310)|
| 3:25:15| I think that's the right approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| Unfortunately, it's not a simple problem that has a simple solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12317)|
| 3:25:24| I think the short answer to your question is to invoke every tool that we have in our toolbox with the stormwater regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12324)|
| 3:25:33| to keep vigilant on inspections and on enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12333)|
| 3:25:37| And I think that the suggestion to require certain low-impact development practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12337)|
| 3:25:45| if a phase two is forwarded by the developers, is another approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12345)|
| 3:25:51| But I have to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| I don't have an all-encompassing answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| I can't stand here and say I have the answer that's going to satisfy your concerns and Ms. Cole's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12355)|
| 3:26:04| The State of Tennessee had actually gone out there, I think, in their fifth notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12364)|
| 3:26:08| They had some recommendations to be done for the developer to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12368)|
| 3:26:12| I think it would be incumbent upon us to say that the developer did them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12372)|
| 3:26:15| and part of that particular plan was, if I can find it here, was the removal of accumulated sediment from the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12375)|
| 3:26:22| That's all that Ms. Cole has been asking us to do now for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12382)|
| 3:26:26| I guess what I'm saying is that we have a state NOV that says here are the recommended compliance activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12386)|
| 3:26:35| that this county commission has said before that we need to address this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12395)|
| 3:26:41| The state has said here are some solutions to this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12401)|
| 3:26:45| One of them says provide for removing accumulated sediment from the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12405)|
| 3:26:50| Which would probably involve a temporary installation of a cofferdam to divert the flow around the work areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12410)|
| 3:26:56| and to clean up the deep streams downstream from the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12416)|
| 3:27:02| What is our status on complying with the state's NOV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12422)|
| 3:27:05| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12425)|
| 3:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12426)|
| 3:27:07| Let me clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12427)|
| 3:27:08| The state issues a notice of violation to the developer, and I don't know the date of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12428)|
| 3:27:13| I was actually one pass through my office, I guess last week, actually, regarding Graysburg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12433)|
| 3:27:19| and had some rather interesting suggestions from the state as to what the Graysburg developers ought to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12439)|
| 3:27:26| Some didn't appear to really be within the state's legal jurisdiction, but they were interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12446)|
| 3:27:34| With regards to sediment in the stream, that's exactly what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12454)|
| 3:27:38| When we investigated the stream, we expected to find these large amounts of sediment that needed to be dredged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12458)|
| 3:27:46| needed to be removed, and basically began the scoping process for a restoration or a mitigation project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12466)|
| 3:27:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12473)|
| 3:27:54| That is what I expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12474)|
| 3:27:57| I think that's what my inspectors inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12477)|
| 3:28:00| That's what everyone would have expected from looking at the stream in a very detailed and methodical scientific manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12480)|
| 3:28:07| What we found, I have to say, does not support what you read in that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12487)|
| 3:28:14| If you read the letter, you say, well, okay, there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12494)|
| 3:28:18| You need to go out there and dredge that out and fix it and make sure you don't cause more damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12498)|
| 3:28:23| What we found doesn't seem to match up to what the letter implies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| Well, has the state released everybody from this notice of violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12507)|
| 3:28:31| or does the state need to come back and decertify this or what needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| Because right now we have a situation out there according to a notice of violation of law that needs to be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12516)|
| 3:28:44| and they've given us some corrective actions, and we need to make sure that it's either happening or not happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| and we need to either work with the state to get it straight or we need to get it fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12529)|
| 3:28:53| Absolutely, and I would make one correction to that and say those are not corrective actions for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12533)|
| 3:28:59| but rather corrective actions for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| But following up on that, that's part of our enforcement and our oversight procedure, and we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| Even if there may be something that when that was written it may have been very appropriate and now it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12547)|
| 3:29:13| it may have been an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| Nobody's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12555)|
| 3:29:16| We've got to get to the bottom of it and figure out what the meaning is, what the status of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12556)|
| 3:29:20| I don't know if you can revoke a notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12560)|
| 3:29:23| I don't know exactly what that procedure would be with the state, but we can get some clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12563)|
| 3:29:28| The only really concern I have, and I'm going to let Commissioner Norman speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12568)|
| 3:29:32| the only concern I have is we always have a reason why we can't, why we don't, why it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12572)|
| 3:29:37| We're not sure, and we don't really know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12577)|
| 3:29:40| But we have paperwork that says we're in a problem, we have a problem, we have pictures that say a problem, there is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12580)|
| 3:29:46| So we have a mismatch between the Department of Knox County and a solution that this county commission has asked us to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12586)|
| 3:29:53| and has asked the county to cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12593)|
| 3:29:57| Right now, I'm wanting that mismatch to come into alignment that we have this problem cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12597)|
| 3:30:04| And we're going to come back every county commission meeting as long as I'm here until it's cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12604)|
| 3:30:09| I mean, I'm serious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| And nobody's putting me on to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12611)|
| 3:30:14| I mean, nobody's putting the pressure on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12614)|
| 3:30:16| Ms. Cole hasn't put the pressure on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12616)|
| 3:30:19| But I think as we have this stormwater problem, this is one of the worst situations around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12619)|
| 3:30:24| and it's probably the most perplexing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12624)|
| 3:30:27| And when we cure this one, then there's probably not many across Knox County that we can't cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| And I expect to have a cure from this before I leave office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| I'm not going to back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| I'm used up more of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12639)|
| 3:30:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12640)|
| 3:30:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12642)|
| 3:30:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| I agree with Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12645)|
| 3:30:48| And the fact that you're already making commitment, you're saying, yes, there is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12648)|
| 3:30:55| We're going to stay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12655)|
| 3:30:57| The state issue in terms of NOVs, that brings up another consideration that we've got to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12657)|
| 3:31:04| And so you're going to stay after it, and you're going to work to get this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12664)|
| 3:31:08| And we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12668)|
| 3:31:10| Simultaneously, I think the issue of Ms. Cole's property can be beneficial to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12670)|
| 3:31:19| And, of course, as we go about the process of reviewing the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12679)|
| 3:31:25| and you mentioned your toolbox, if your toolbox doesn't have enough tools in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12685)|
| 3:31:30| and Laura Cole's property is an example that it doesn't have enough tools in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12690)|
| 3:31:36| then, of course, we can use Laura Cole in a beneficial way to Knox County to enhance that toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12696)|
| 3:31:43| And I hope that's what we're about to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| So thank you for your continued service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| And, indeed, Mr. Armstrong and I together will keep bringing this up until we get some satisfactory solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12707)|
| 3:31:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12717)|
| 3:32:05| I hit the button by mistake when I got up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12725)|
| 3:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12728)|
| 3:32:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12730)|
| 3:32:12| Why can't we instruct our law director to file a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12732)|
| 3:32:16| I mean, I'm hearing that there are issues, that there are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12736)|
| 3:32:19| We've been dealing with this for months and months and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12739)|
| 3:32:22| Bottom line, why can't Knox County say, file a lawsuit, get it straightened out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12742)|
| 3:32:29| Well, my understanding, it might be a question best directed to your left there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12749)|
| 3:32:35| but my understanding is that there's not actually a violation of county code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12755)|
| 3:32:42| an all-encompassing violation of county code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12762)|
| 3:32:45| And that's the reason that we've endeavored to start this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12765)|
| 3:32:49| and start talking about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12769)|
| 3:32:55| But there are state issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12775)|
| 3:32:58| I'm not trying to get an understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12778)|
| 3:33:00| Yes, apparently there are state issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12780)|
| 3:33:02| In fact, as I said, I received a copy of a letter that I don't believe I had been aware of prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12782)|
| 3:33:09| with some recommendations from the state for the Graysburg developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12789)|
| 3:33:14| I don't know what the date on it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12794)|
| 3:33:17| I don't believe that we can make that sort of action, legal action, on behalf of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12797)|
| 3:33:24| Could we recommend to the state that they file a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12804)|
| 3:33:29| I suppose we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12809)|
| 3:33:31| I mean, my point is, and I'm in full agreement with Commissioner Armstrong there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12811)|
| 3:33:35| this is not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12815)|
| 3:33:37| And so it's obvious that there are issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12817)|
| 3:33:42| And so I'm just thinking, to me, if I'm a developer and nothing really happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12822)|
| 3:33:50| I'm just hearing a lot of talk, I'm just going to kind of go with the flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12830)|
| 3:33:55| But if all of a sudden I think, wow, these people mean business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12835)|
| 3:33:58| then I might decide that I need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12838)|
| 3:34:01| So that's why I'm asking, bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| is there a way of going to the state or somebody and saying, let's file a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12843)|
| 3:34:10| Well, there is a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12850)|
| 3:34:11| And on the contrary, there are many actions that we do take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12851)|
| 3:34:14| We issue civil penalties, notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12854)|
| 3:34:17| We're in the process of perfecting a system to develop a director's order, similar to what the state does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12857)|
| 3:34:26| where a penalty is assessed, a cost for remedial action is assessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12866)|
| 3:34:32| and it's essentially placed on the property in a pretty expedient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12872)|
| 3:34:37| Do they pay it, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| Well, this is something that we're developing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| We're working on this to develop the toolkit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| We have notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| We have the ability to, there are cases that we are recommending for legal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12885)|
| 3:34:53| But the truth is that in this Graysburg property, I have to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12893)|
| 3:34:57| there's not a glaring violation of county code going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12897)|
| 3:35:01| We've had a situation where somebody has a house lot that has bare soil on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12901)|
| 3:35:08| and we've issued a notice of violation, and in that case they paid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12908)|
| 3:35:12| We had somebody on a neighboring property recently who cleared a lot to place a mobile home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12912)|
| 3:35:18| and they didn't have the proper permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| We issued a notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12920)|
| 3:35:22| They took corrective action, and they're paying the penalty that was associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12922)|
| 3:35:28| So every action that we've taken has been responded to pretty much in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12928)|
| 3:35:36| The developers themselves are really not active in this Graysburg property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12936)|
| 3:35:42| What's going on mostly is single house construction, and to be honest, not very much of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12942)|
| 3:35:54| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12954)|
| 3:35:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12956)|
| 3:35:59| Representing the 7th District, as everyone knows, we have had our share of this same situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12959)|
| 3:36:05| and we are still having our share of this same situation with flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12965)|
| 3:36:11| and developing and all causing problems on other people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| So it is an issue that I take very much to heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12975)|
| 3:36:18| and I'm looking forward to trying to get some issues resolved on taking care of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12978)|
| 3:36:25| Now, I understand it sounds to me like the developer has taken his hands off of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12985)|
| 3:36:34| That's the key problem, and Knox County is saying that there's no problem with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=12994)|
| 3:36:44| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13004)|
| 3:36:46| I mean, Knox County is abiding with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13006)|
| 3:36:48| There's no problem with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| It's the state that has come in and filed these citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13010)|
| 3:36:55| The notices that Commissioner Armstrong was referring to are from the state, from TDAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13015)|
| 3:37:00| The developer, this isn't a case where the developer is abandoned or walked away from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13020)|
| 3:37:05| Basically, the construction is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13025)|
| 3:37:08| The roads are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13028)|
| 3:37:09| It's to the point that there are people buying lots and building houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13029)|
| 3:37:15| And if you walked out to the site now, what you'd see is some houses, some sidewalks, some roads, and a lot of grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13035)|
| 3:37:23| It wouldn't look like what you would imagine when you think of a construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13043)|
| 3:37:27| So it's not a case of it being abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13047)|
| 3:37:30| What I'm saying is that the development followed the regulations that were in place at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13050)|
| 3:37:37| And you've got to remember that this was built under the 2005 Knox County stormwater regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13057)|
| 3:37:44| We have new regulations now, and we also have some new procedures for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13064)|
| 3:37:51| But the work that the developer initially was doing ultimately was compliant with the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13071)|
| 3:38:00| So there's not an outstanding issue with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13080)|
| 3:38:02| That's not to say that there's not an issue, and that's not to say that tomorrow someone might not go out with a bobcat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13082)|
| 3:38:08| and make the whole site out of compliance and we'll be there for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13088)|
| 3:38:12| But there's not an issue with the developer with Knox County currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13092)|
| 3:38:16| So right now we're really dealing with these state citations that we need to get clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13096)|
| 3:38:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13102)|
| 3:38:23| So I would like to be the same as Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13103)|
| 3:38:27| ask our law director on what is our next step on what we can do in terms of getting this problem settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13107)|
| 3:38:42| I was trying to get Commissioner Hammond to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| These are the most vexing problems I know that bodies politic face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13126)|
| 3:38:49| I've been doing this for 20 years, and it always comes down to when you have one landowner who's doing something injurious to another landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13129)|
| 3:38:55| can the county step in the shoes of that landowner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13135)|
| 3:38:58| And generally, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13138)|
| 3:38:59| You can't lend your credit to assist private landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| If, however, you have a landowner who is doing something that is contrary to our code, that we can take a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13141)|
| 3:39:08| We can likewise ask a state entity, if they feel there's a violation under state code, to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13148)|
| 3:39:16| But we can't stand in the shoes of a private citizen and sue because they're being injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13156)|
| 3:39:21| I know it sounds harsh, but again, it's lending your credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13161)|
| 3:39:24| And then the cumulative effect of that, anytime you have a dispute between warring landlords,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13164)|
| 3:39:29| one of them is going to ask you to step up and file on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| And that's the problem you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13172)|
| 3:39:34| I understand how frustrating that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13174)|
| 3:39:36| It would be a lot simpler if we could just step in and remedy this, but unfortunately we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13176)|
| 3:39:40| But when Commissioner Hammond was suggesting, can we ask the state to look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13180)|
| 3:39:44| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13184)|
| 3:39:51| Mr. Jarrett, as regards water and being a common property of the people of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13191)|
| 3:40:01| and when we have erosion into the body of water, is that not an area that is of our concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13201)|
| 3:40:12| Well, it's certainly your concern, but again, you're talking about riparian water rights, which is another unique body of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13212)|
| 3:40:18| It's one thing if you have someone who's altering a natural water course or publicly owned water sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13218)|
| 3:40:26| It's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13226)|
| 3:40:27| Again, if the damage is to an adjoining landowner, there's essentially the conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13227)|
| 3:40:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13234)|
| 3:40:35| But we could make the contention that the damage is to the people of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13235)|
| 3:40:42| and to the waters of the Tennessee River, because that's the ultimate receiving stream of this stream, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13242)|
| 3:40:52| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13252)|
| 3:40:54| Once it transcends past these properties, what if any damage is being done to state lands, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13254)|
| 3:41:01| but once it permeates beyond Knox County, then again you're getting back to a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13261)|
| 3:41:06| But your safest ground in terms of a defensible lawsuit is going to be suing someone who is violating your code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13266)|
| 3:41:13| and refused to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| Then you get them, you enjoin them, in other words, you seek an injunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13275)|
| 3:41:18| Then they come under the contempt powers of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13278)|
| 3:41:21| And once that occurs, then you have some teeth there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13281)|
| 3:41:24| So a court can ultimately hold someone in contempt and issue everything up to a jail sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13284)|
| 3:41:30| if the court feels their behavior is contemptuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13290)|
| 3:41:36| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13296)|
| 3:41:38| Chris, do you know what is the penalty that they have been paying the penalties in other violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13298)|
| 3:41:43| How much are they paying, $50 or $100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13303)|
| 3:41:47| Now, you all, a couple of years ago, approved the minimum civil penalty of $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13307)|
| 3:41:54| So you know it's more than $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13314)|
| 3:41:57| No, I think the last ones were $500 and $1,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13317)|
| 3:42:04| On the same piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13324)|
| 3:42:05| No, those were the two I mentioned when I was speaking earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13325)|
| 3:42:09| And I don't remember the other numbers, but there's something in the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13329)|
| 3:42:14| Usually, you know, on average it's, you know, something, $500 is usually what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13334)|
| 3:42:21| I think there was a $1,000 penalty that was a second offense or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13341)|
| 3:42:27| What is the highest we can go, $5,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| It's $5,000 per day per civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13349)|
| 3:42:33| So we're legally allowed to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13353)|
| 3:42:36| Well, there have been days when we have issued $25,000 in a single flurry of letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13356)|
| 3:42:42| Have you got paid for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13362)|
| 3:42:44| Yes, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13364)|
| 3:42:46| There was some, a bit of a remediation process involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13366)|
| 3:42:53| That wasn't Graysburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13373)|
| 3:42:56| It was a completely different site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13376)|
| 3:42:58| Is that in-kind money or do projects, other than paying money, they can do projects in another area of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13378)|
| 3:43:06| No, we don't do, actually we try to avoid the idea of in-kind mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13386)|
| 3:43:12| We feel like it doesn't really address the issue at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13392)|
| 3:43:15| In other words, I don't believe that this body would be pleased if I came back next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13395)|
| 3:43:20| and announced that we had done a nice park project in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13400)|
| 3:43:27| Well, it has to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| Mediate the issues in Graysburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| I know the city has mediation, but they haven't do, like they restore a creek or something that might be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13409)|
| 3:43:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13417)|
| 3:43:38| That's a model that's used often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13418)|
| 3:43:39| In fact, the state uses that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| I guess what I'm saying is that as a department, we try to stay away from that policy because we try to keep work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13421)|
| 3:43:49| and keep mitigation and basically keep the solutions in the same watershed as the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13429)|
| 3:43:56| because we have to look at the county and its environmental issues on a watershed basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13436)|
| 3:44:00| Now, what about bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13440)|
| 3:44:02| Does this developer, does he still have bonds on that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| Probably not, does he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13444)|
| 3:44:06| No, there's no bonded work remaining to be done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13446)|
| 3:44:10| When do you release the bond on a piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13450)|
| 3:44:12| When they come and ask you for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13452)|
| 3:44:15| It has to be a significant amount of completion currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13455)|
| 3:44:18| The policy is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13458)|
| 3:44:20| But usually 85 or greater percent complete on the house construction for some of the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13460)|
| 3:44:28| contingency parts of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13468)|
| 3:44:30| Thanks, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13470)|
| 3:44:32| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13472)|
| 3:44:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13475)|
| 3:44:38| Are all the streets finished paved up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13478)|
| 3:44:41| Or are they still just base coat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13481)|
| 3:44:52| You know, now that you mention that, I don't know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13492)|
| 3:44:54| And if they are still in binder, I stand corrected on my previous answer, there would be a bond for the paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13494)|
| 3:45:04| I believe that they are paved from when I was driving around in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13504)|
| 3:45:08| I'm almost 90 percent sure they were paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13508)|
| 3:45:12| And they did that recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13512)|
| 3:45:15| This was a couple of months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13515)|
| 3:45:19| But if I remember correctly, I remember driving on nice, smooth pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13519)|
| 3:45:23| and getting off of pavement to go take those pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13523)|
| 3:45:29| Then my next question then is I'm going to come to Commissioner Hammond and his idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| Since he brought the idea to the table, I'll let him maybe clarify the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13534)|
| 3:45:39| But I would like for the law director and the law department to look into Commissioner Hammond's idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13539)|
| 3:45:46| as to how we might motivate the state in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13546)|
| 3:45:50| If you'd like to make that motion, either Commissioner Pinkston and I will be happy to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13550)|
| 3:45:55| Or I'm sure others would, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13555)|
| 3:45:56| But if you want to make that as a motion as to put the force of the body behind the letter, I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13556)|
| 3:46:01| I'll second it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| I don't know whether I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13563)|
| 3:46:04| Well, we need to amend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13564)|
| 3:46:06| It's going to be a big deal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13566)|
| 3:46:09| If you want to make the motion to amend, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13569)|
| 3:46:12| Make a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13572)|
| 3:46:13| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| Amend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13575)|
| 3:46:19| I think it's actually to suspend the rules for the purpose of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13579)|
| 3:46:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| You have to do a roll call vote, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13589)|
| 3:46:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13594)|
| 3:46:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13595)|
| 3:46:36| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13596)|
| 3:46:40| Who wanted to make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13600)|
| 3:46:42| I'd like to make a motion that we direct the Law Department into looking at writing a letter to the State of Tennessee stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13602)|
| 3:46:50| whatever is necessary to enforce their notices of violation at Graysburg, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13610)|
| 3:46:57| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13617)|
| 3:47:03| Yeah, in a resolution form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13623)|
| 3:47:10| And give it a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13630)|
| 3:47:14| Did you have some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13634)|
| 3:47:17| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13637)|
| 3:47:18| No, I was just referring to Commissioner Hammond there a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13638)|
| 3:47:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13643)|
| 3:47:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13644)|
| 3:47:25| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| The resolution 907 is the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13647)|
| 3:47:29| Yeah, 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13649)|
| 3:47:34| Okay, I guess the last item on the agenda is moving up the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13654)|
| 3:47:42| As I was stating in doing beer matters, some people said that they probably wouldn't be here on the 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13662)|
| 3:47:53| which is Christmas week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| I'll make a motion to suspend the rules so we can add an item to the agenda so that we can discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13675)|
| 3:48:01| or change the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13681)|
| 3:48:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13684)|
| 3:48:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13686)|
| 3:48:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13687)|
| 3:48:08| Unanimous again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13688)|
| 3:48:11| Make a motion we move our December meeting, regular scheduled meeting, from the 21st to the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13691)|
| 3:48:21| and that the committees will be the week prior the Monday and the Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13701)|
| 3:48:27| I believe that would be the 7th and the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13707)|
| 3:48:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13710)|
| 3:48:31| Does anyone have a problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13711)|
| 3:48:34| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13714)|
| 3:48:36| I'll be out of town for the committee meeting, but I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13716)|
| 3:48:40| I guess maybe this needs to go to Jolene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13720)|
| 3:48:43| Normally the items have to be in by the first day of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13723)|
| 3:48:46| Does that give her enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13726)|
| 3:48:47| Yes, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13727)|
| 3:48:48| By the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13728)|
| 3:48:49| They have to be in with the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13729)|
| 3:48:53| I think the first Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13733)|
| 3:48:57| It's supposed to be in the first Monday of the month, but that doesn't fall until the 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13737)|
| 3:49:02| which is when you want to have your first committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13742)|
| 3:49:05| So if we can just have it on the first of the month, which is that Tuesday, I'll just type real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13745)|
| 3:49:14| Of course, the agenda committee will still meet that first Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13754)|
| 3:49:18| It will be on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13758)|
| 3:49:24| No one has a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13764)|
| 3:49:26| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13766)|
| 3:49:27| Let me just ask, Chairman, so instead of the normal meeting, which is on usually the fourth Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13767)|
| 3:49:34| the 28th, we're going to move it to the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13774)|
| 3:49:37| It was already scheduled for the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13777)|
| 3:49:38| It was already backed one week, so now we're moving it back two from regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13778)|
| 3:49:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13782)|
| 3:49:43| It's all in the way the days fell this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13783)|
| 3:49:49| All in favor of moving it back another week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13789)|
| 3:49:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13792)|
| 3:49:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13793)|
| 3:49:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13794)|
| 3:49:55| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13795)|
| 3:49:56| We may not have much for you to put on the agenda if you don't have much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13796)|
| 3:50:00| That January meeting might be a bearer, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13800)|
| 3:50:03| We have too many weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13803)|
| 3:50:07| Anything else need to come before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13807)|
| 3:50:11| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13811)|

| 3:53:05| We have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13985)|
| 3:53:07| You, Mrs. Pratt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13987)|
| 3:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13990)|
| 3:53:11| I'd like to hear from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13991)|
| 3:53:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13995)|
| 3:53:16| This is a request to amend the plan, sector plan and rezone approximately 10 acres located in the East County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=13996)|
| 3:53:28| The plan request is to go from low density residential to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14008)|
| 3:53:33| The zoning request is to go from A.A. to C.A. General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14013)|
| 3:53:40| Existing property is vacant and the proposed use is for a storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14020)|
| 3:53:46| Planning Commission recommended denial of both the plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14026)|
| 3:53:53| Which one would like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14033)|
| 3:53:58| You have five minutes, Mrs. Pratt, and I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14038)|
| 3:54:01| Julie Pratt, 519 Paddy Road, Knoxville, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14041)|
| 3:54:11| I believe this decision needs to be made totally on the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14051)|
| 3:54:15| The facts of this area are, or the facts are, per county MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14055)|
| 3:54:20| both requests for zoning to commercial and a change in the sector plan are not consistent with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14060)|
| 3:54:27| The county staff, they have nothing to gain by saying that they feel like it should be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14067)|
| 3:54:35| They are neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14075)|
| 3:54:38| The request has already been denied twice by MPC last year and then again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14078)|
| 3:54:45| The community is opposed to a change in zoning and the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14085)|
| 3:54:50| And I've spent a great deal of time finding out by going door to door to my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14090)|
| 3:54:56| This would be an intrusion into our residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| The county's own plan has been and is for residential or agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14100)|
| 3:55:06| This basically is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14106)|
| 3:55:09| This is not a one-person opposition as Mr. Edders would suggest in his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14109)|
| 3:55:15| I'm one person speaking on behalf of my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14115)|
| 3:55:19| I do live in this community and I'm not going to apologize for standing up for my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14119)|
| 3:55:24| and for speaking out on behalf of myself and my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14124)|
| 3:55:27| This is clearly not a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14127)|
| 3:55:30| If they want commercial, they should find property in a commercially zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14130)|
| 3:55:34| Of course, the property in a commercially zoned area is more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14134)|
| 3:55:43| This is basically all about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14143)|
| 3:55:45| They do not care to destroy our neighborhood as long as they get a good deal on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14145)|
| 3:55:50| There are plenty of commercially zoned areas that could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14150)|
| 3:55:53| To name a few in our area that aren't too far away is Strawberry Plains Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14153)|
| 3:55:58| John Sevier Highway, Asheville Highway, and Rutledge Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14158)|
| 3:56:03| Mr. Edders should be aware of the Rutledge Park as he is part of a large commercial establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14163)|
| 3:56:08| there, Bulldog Development slash Claiborne Trucking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14168)|
| 3:56:12| Why does Mr. Edders not put this on his own residential neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14172)|
| 3:56:17| Could it be he wouldn't want the noise, the lighting, or whatever he plans in his neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14177)|
| 3:56:22| I don't think you would want this in your neighborhood either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14182)|
| 3:56:25| I'd like you to please take a step back and think about if this was trying to be done in your own residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14185)|
| 3:56:31| Mr. Edders last year asked me what he could do to change my mind on fighting his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14191)|
| 3:56:36| I suggested he put what it's zoned for, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14196)|
| 3:56:40| I'm not against residential in this area or other houses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14200)|
| 3:56:44| It's just not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14204)|
| 3:56:46| The roads can't handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14206)|
| 3:56:48| I don't know if you all have been out there and seen this property, but it is not an area for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14208)|
| 3:56:57| We are opposed to a change to commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14217)|
| 3:57:01| If approved, it will destroy our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| We'll never be able to bring back the integrity of the neighborhood residential setting if you allow this to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14223)|
| 3:57:09| We don't know what they would actually do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14229)|
| 3:57:12| At this point, Mr. Edders said it's for storage containers that will be pulled in and out of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14232)|
| 3:57:17| But what if they decide it's for their dump trucks to work from this property to how rock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14237)|
| 3:57:22| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14242)|
| 3:57:24| And at that point, it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14244)|
| 3:57:30| Businesses may come and go, but it leaves the neighbors and the residents to deal with the mess that was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14250)|
| 3:57:36| We cannot be haphazard on allowing companies to intrude on residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14256)|
| 3:57:41| We do not need to allow spot zoning, which is exactly what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14261)|
| 3:57:47| Our community respectfully requests that this be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14267)|
| 3:57:50| On behalf of myself and my neighbors, we would appreciate your support in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14270)|
| 3:57:55| Please deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14275)|
| 3:57:57| We do not need to be distracted by buffers versus non-buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14277)|
| 3:58:01| We don't care about buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14281)|
| 3:58:03| It's not a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14283)|
| 3:58:09| I just think we need to really think about this, and I hope that you support our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14289)|
| 3:58:15| We can't afford for this to happen to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14295)|
| 3:58:19| And we really do want your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14299)|
| 3:58:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14302)|
| 3:58:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14303)|
| 3:58:24| You have five minutes, Mr. Edders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14304)|
| 3:58:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14315)|
| 3:58:37| Just for conversation right off the bat, Chris Edders, 6210 Rutledge Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14317)|
| 3:58:45| Claiborne Hauling does not own this property, nor does ever intend to own it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14325)|
| 3:58:50| It's been sold to the Epperly Family Partnership, of which we'll produce in-and-out containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14330)|
| 3:58:57| Going back to my appeal, as I can read what I've written here, the reason for the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14337)|
| 3:59:04| after the meeting, referring back to the 10809 meeting last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14344)|
| 3:59:08| after meeting and talking with MP staff, I would like a chance to rediscuss this matter using large buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14348)|
| 3:59:15| and conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14355)|
| 3:59:16| Conditional zoning has happened in 1988, 93, and 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14356)|
| 3:59:22| Also, a petition presented in prior meeting by one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14362)|
| 3:59:26| With no disrespect, the opposition was not truly factual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14366)|
| 3:59:29| and in good representation of actual persons living in the nearby addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14369)|
| 3:59:37| Tonight I'm just asking, with respect and with the grace of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14377)|
| 3:59:43| to allow me to go back before MPC not to render a decision of whether or not it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14383)|
| 3:59:52| or should not be zoned or not zoned or spot zoned is not even an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14392)|
| 3:59:59| Conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14399)|
| 4:00:02| The petition that I was copied on has 31 signatures or 31 pages to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14402)|
| 4:00:12| I got that on 10-8, excuse me, on 10-9 after Ms. Pratt had submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14412)|
| 4:00:17| And I submit to you tonight with integrity and respect that there was one-third of this had names and addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14417)|
| 4:00:23| and signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| Another third of it has signatures and no addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14425)|
| 4:00:31| Another third of it, third of the listing of the 31 names, are within four and a half to five miles away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14431)|
| 4:00:38| never to be impacted if, in fact, we went back before MPC and could find favor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14438)|
| 4:00:45| Respectively, tonight I'm just asking that the commissioners would find me available to go back before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14445)|
| 4:00:55| win, lose, or draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14455)|
| 4:01:01| Within that meeting with MPC, I can get a better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14461)|
| 4:01:07| I can discuss with them about conditional zoning, offering large buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14467)|
| 4:01:14| particularly wooded buffers that would not, you know, this is right along Interstate 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14474)|
| 4:01:19| It's within 300 yards of eight and a half acres of CB land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14479)|
| 4:01:25| No signage on either side of this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| They are signs that it's zoned CB, but that was zoned specifically for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14487)|
| 4:01:32| I'm not here to mislead you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14492)|
| 4:01:35| It was zoned for signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14495)|
| 4:01:38| No signage can go up on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14498)|
| 4:01:44| I would just ask, respectively, again, that I could be appealed and voted on to go back before the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14504)|
| 4:01:54| to better understand, now that I do understand, better understand with the MPC maybe a possibility of commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14514)|
| 4:02:04| In this area that was mentioned by Ms. Pratt, Straw Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14524)|
| 4:02:08| Straw Plains Asheville Highway, very much heavily commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14528)|
| 4:02:12| The road is a 22-foot wide road, but we're here not tonight to discuss zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14532)|
| 4:02:18| I just want my appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14538)|
| 4:02:20| That's all that I would request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14540)|
| 4:02:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14541)|
| 4:02:22| I'll reserve any other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14542)|
| 4:02:25| Ms. Pratt, you can have a three-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14545)|
| 4:02:29| I would like to say that all the petitioners are people from the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14549)|
| 4:02:34| He makes it sound like, you know, they're not immediately impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14554)|
| 4:02:38| These are people that travel to and from our church just up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14558)|
| 4:02:42| They are people from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14562)|
| 4:02:44| I've gotten additional names, and I do have addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14564)|
| 4:02:47| I do have their signature and their written names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14567)|
| 4:02:50| I've worked hard to try to, you know, get to people because I work and everybody else in the neighborhood works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14570)|
| 4:02:56| It's hard to get everybody's signature, but I have 40 different names from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14576)|
| 4:03:01| You know, I'm not trying to mislead you in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14581)|
| 4:03:05| and I didn't feel like anything that I presented at MPC was not factual in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14585)|
| 4:03:12| I went door to door to everyone in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14592)|
| 4:03:15| and pretty much got everybody in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14595)|
| 4:03:20| And I think, you know, if you travel this road a lot, I wish, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14600)|
| 4:03:24| some of you knew the road so you'd know because it's just not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14604)|
| 4:03:30| We have, I did have a neighbor that came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14610)|
| 4:03:33| I came to his door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14613)|
| 4:03:34| He wasn't home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14614)|
| 4:03:35| I left him a letter, and he's come down here to say that he doesn't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14615)|
| 4:03:40| He knows the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14620)|
| 4:03:41| He's been a bus driver for years and knows how the roads are and if they're appropriate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14621)|
| 4:03:48| Mr. Edders, when it was denied at MPC last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14628)|
| 4:03:54| the next thing we knew there were big trash containers put on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14634)|
| 4:03:58| Well, I called in because here these trash containers were after they were denied commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14638)|
| 4:04:03| and he says, well, we were just doing it for advertisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14643)|
| 4:04:06| That's what he said to MPC last month, just doing it for advertisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14646)|
| 4:04:11| Well, that's kind of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14651)|
| 4:04:13| You know, he can try to say he's going to be respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14653)|
| 4:04:17| I don't feel like he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| When you go against what you've already been told you can't do, that doesn't show me respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14659)|
| 4:04:26| I just hope that you all will really think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14666)|
| 4:04:30| And, you know, I want you to decide on our side, but it's really not a side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14670)|
| 4:04:36| It's whether it's right or wrong for the area, and it is not right for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14676)|
| 4:04:42| That's basically what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14682)|
| 4:04:46| Okay, Mr. Edders, you have three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14686)|
| 4:04:52| I hate not arguing, but I hate convos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14692)|
| 4:05:01| There's a welding shop right across the street from this property right now existing in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14701)|
| 4:05:07| The trash containers, there was two trash containers stacked up on the property back along I-40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14707)|
| 4:05:14| with banners on it that said Claiborne Hauling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14714)|
| 4:05:18| They were there until I never got a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14718)|
| 4:05:22| They were there until I needed the containers, and then I went in and moved them and hauled them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14722)|
| 4:05:29| I still say that this is just for an appeal, and respectfully ask that just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14729)|
| 4:05:37| The gentleman to my right, he and I will discuss it at a later date and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14737)|
| 4:05:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14743)|
| 4:05:46| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14746)|
| 4:05:49| Yeah, I had a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14749)|
| 4:05:53| This involves a sector plan change, and if I remember correctly over the lawsuit that we went through over commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14753)|
| 4:06:02| changing sector plans, this pretty much has to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14762)|
| 4:06:06| I mean, we're not capable of ruling on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14766)|
| 4:06:09| Doesn't any sector plan change have to go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14769)|
| 4:06:16| That would be the safest determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14776)|
| 4:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14779)|
| 4:06:20| Considering the comments of both parties, it seems unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14780)|
| 4:06:25| I'll defer to the commission's wisdom, but this seems like something would be wise to go back to MPC for another look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14785)|
| 4:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14791)|
| 4:06:34| I'm going to make that as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14794)|
| 4:06:35| Like I said, we just recently had a lawsuit, and we got ourselves in a little bit of a pickle by dealing with sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14795)|
| 4:06:43| That is very strictly the work of Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14803)|
| 4:06:48| So just to be on the safe side, I'm going to make the motion that we send this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14808)|
| 4:06:54| and let them make the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14814)|
| 4:06:55| I believe that's in compliance with what the court said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14815)|
| 4:07:00| I know technically we might kill it today, but if we approved it today, it would be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14820)|
| 4:07:10| So I believe that likewise, if we denied it today, it would be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14830)|
| 4:07:14| This is clearly not the decision of the commission based on Judge Fansler's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14834)|
| 4:07:20| It is very clearly an MPC decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14840)|
| 4:07:22| So to be on the safe side, I'm going to make the motion that we send this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14842)|
| 4:07:27| and let them do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14847)|
| 4:07:32| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14852)|
| 4:07:35| Except we need to clarify what Mr. Lampert said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14855)|
| 4:07:38| An aye vote here is for the appeal for it to go back, not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14858)|
| 4:07:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14864)|
| 4:07:45| It's for the appeal to go back for them to make the decision on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14865)|
| 4:07:48| Where essentially my motion is is that we make no decision on this because it involves a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14868)|
| 4:07:55| and an abundance of caution toward Mr. Fansler's decision that we send it back to MPC where it belongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14875)|
| 4:08:02| So my motion is not that we say this is a good thing or that we say this is a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14882)|
| 4:08:08| My motion is that we simply say this is not the commission's thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14888)|
| 4:08:12| This is MPC's thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14892)|
| 4:08:15| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14895)|
| 4:08:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14897)|
| 4:08:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14898)|
| 4:08:19| Commissioner Lambert's reasoning is precisely backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14899)|
| 4:08:22| The judge's ruling was about where a sector plan should originate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14902)|
| 4:08:29| MPC denied a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14909)|
| 4:08:33| So they're not originating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14913)|
| 4:08:35| If we turn down this appeal, we are not originating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14915)|
| 4:08:38| So no one is originating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14918)|
| 4:08:40| So the more logical course of action is to go along with the 39 neighbors who signed the petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14920)|
| 4:08:46| and support the existing zoning and vote to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14926)|
| 4:08:50| That way nobody is initiating a sector plan and your argument is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14930)|
| 4:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14934)|
| 4:08:55| Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14935)|
| 4:08:56| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14936)|
| 4:08:57| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14937)|
| 4:08:58| I still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14938)|
| 4:08:59| No, I've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14939)|
| 4:09:00| Do we have a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14940)|
| 4:09:03| Make a second so we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14943)|
| 4:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14945)|
| 4:09:11| I guess my question is to Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14951)|
| 4:09:12| Chris, now you're wanting to go back to MPC for reevaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14952)|
| 4:09:17| or trying to work with the neighborhood to see if there's something you can do there to help appease both the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14957)|
| 4:09:23| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14963)|
| 4:09:24| That's exactly what I'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14964)|
| 4:09:26| And if MPC turns you down, are you going to appeal it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14966)|
| 4:09:29| No, sir, I'd say that there would be no fault, no, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14969)|
| 4:09:32| No reason to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14972)|
| 4:09:33| No, there's no reason to come back before you all because then I would have just been beating a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14973)|
| 4:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14979)|
| 4:09:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14980)|
| 4:09:42| Do we have one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=14982)|
| 4:10:02| The chairman has asked me to go ahead and take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15002)|
| 4:10:05| Commissioner Lambert, were you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15005)|
| 4:10:08| Yes, I guess I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15008)|
| 4:10:09| The point I was going to make is Mr. Harmon, while he has an abundance of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15009)|
| 4:10:14| his education is in communications and I'm going to listen to the law director's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15014)|
| 4:10:20| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15020)|
| 4:10:21| I think you asked the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15021)|
| 4:10:23| Did you give him an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15023)|
| 4:10:24| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15024)|
| 4:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15025)|
| 4:10:26| Now we're going to move on to next in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15026)|
| 4:10:29| Who's got their light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15029)|
| 4:10:33| We're going to call Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15033)|
| 4:10:35| I'm going to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15035)|
| 4:10:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15038)|
| 4:10:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15039)|
| 4:10:41| Commissioner Lambert, will you restate your motion so that everybody is clear on what we're getting ready to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15041)|
| 4:10:47| My motion is we send this back to MPC and let them make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15047)|
| 4:10:53| And the second agrees with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15053)|
| 4:10:55| That's the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15055)|
| 4:10:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15056)|
| 4:10:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15057)|
| 4:10:58| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15058)|
| 4:10:59| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15059)|
| 4:11:01| I saw Laura Coe down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15061)|
| 4:11:05| Did you have a statement you wanted to make or question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15065)|
| 4:11:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15070)|
| 4:11:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15071)|
| 4:11:12| And did you have another question, Ms. Pratt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15072)|
| 4:11:16| If you'll just speak into the microphone so everybody can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15076)|
| 4:11:19| I did want to say one of the neighbors does have something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15079)|
| 4:11:22| He wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15082)|
| 4:11:24| And I wanted to question this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15084)|
| 4:11:25| If we send this back to MPC, are we, like you said, he said he would not do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15085)|
| 4:11:31| But I don't know, you know, that's perfectly fine if we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15091)|
| 4:11:36| But I don't know the point since they've already denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15096)|
| 4:11:39| That kind of seems like beating a dead horse, I mean, truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15099)|
| 4:11:43| It's already been denied twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15103)|
| 4:11:45| And I just don't see the point to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15105)|
| 4:11:48| But Mr. Mitchell would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15108)|
| 4:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15110)|
| 4:11:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15111)|
| 4:11:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15112)|
| 4:11:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15113)|
| 4:11:54| Is there a request for both the zoning and the sector plan to go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15114)|
| 4:11:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15117)|
| 4:11:58| The zoning is irrelevant without the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15118)|
| 4:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15120)|
| 4:12:01| But your motion is to send both back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| To send both back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15123)|
| 4:12:05| And, ma'am, my reasoning for this is this is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15125)|
| 4:12:08| The decision has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15128)|
| 4:12:10| Now he's appealing the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15130)|
| 4:12:12| And in reference to a recent ruling by Judge Fansler, we can't change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15132)|
| 4:12:19| And so when he appeals this, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15139)|
| 4:12:22| Full point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15142)|
| 4:12:23| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15143)|
| 4:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15144)|
| 4:12:25| I asked him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15145)|
| 4:12:26| And I'm going to give him just a little bit of latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15146)|
| 4:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15148)|
| 4:12:29| Could you wrap it up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15149)|
| 4:12:30| The reasoning is they made their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15150)|
| 4:12:33| This gentleman wants to appeal that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15153)|
| 4:12:35| And in light of Judge Fansler's decision, I'm saying that appeals of this nature need to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15155)|
| 4:12:43| And they don't need to go to this body because we've been told to stay out of sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15163)|
| 4:12:47| And the law director, his statements tended to support that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15167)|
| 4:12:52| So I'm not for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15172)|
| 4:12:53| I'm not against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15173)|
| 4:12:54| I'm just giving deference to the MPC whose decision it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15174)|
| 4:12:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15178)|
| 4:12:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15179)|
| 4:13:00| Mark Donaldson, you wanted to say something real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15180)|
| 4:13:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15182)|
| 4:13:03| With all due respect, since the Fansler decision, there has been a change in state law that outlines two processes for amending the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15183)|
| 4:13:13| One, through an initiation by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15193)|
| 4:13:16| The other, through an initiation by the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15196)|
| 4:13:20| So tonight, you can either deny the appeal, or if you want to continue to take action, you could initiate your own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15200)|
| 4:13:34| And thus, it would go back to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15214)|
| 4:13:38| We would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15218)|
| 4:13:40| You would hear our report, and then you could act on it, regardless of the outcome of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15220)|
| 4:13:49| The other way is simply to refer it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15229)|
| 4:13:52| And as the speakers have said, we have denied this twice now within the last 14 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15232)|
| 4:14:00| And I haven't heard anything yet that comes close to meeting the criteria for amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15240)|
| 4:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15250)|
| 4:14:11| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15251)|
| 4:14:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15254)|
| 4:14:15| And that was kind of the line that I wanted to pull a little bit, just to kind of, you know, for us to send it back without any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15255)|
| 4:14:24| just to send it back, I'm trying to understand what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15264)|
| 4:14:27| So I guess I'll ask you, are you planning some changes to the packet that you'll resubmit to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15267)|
| 4:14:37| Most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15279)|
| 4:14:40| To make it more palatable to both the neighbors and the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15280)|
| 4:14:45| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15285)|
| 4:14:46| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15286)|
| 4:14:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15287)|
| 4:14:48| That's exactly what I'm, since the October 8th meeting when I was turned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15288)|
| 4:14:55| I've gone back on I think three different occasions and spoken with different planners and different people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15295)|
| 4:15:02| Whenever I found out that the signatures were not certified and found out all that I found out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15302)|
| 4:15:10| and I thought, well, I've got a prayer's chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15310)|
| 4:15:13| Then also I found out that if I would be, you know, more open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15313)|
| 4:15:17| maybe that the planners could look at it in a different view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15317)|
| 4:15:20| So that's exactly the reason I just humbly request the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15320)|
| 4:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15326)|
| 4:15:27| And I guess this is a question of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15327)|
| 4:15:30| So, I don't know, maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15330)|
| 4:15:33| some of the folks that have been around a little longer than I have could answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15333)|
| 4:15:36| In terms of us sending things back, has that been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15336)|
| 4:15:40| We just, you know, because this is an appeal, we'll just send it back for further negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15340)|
| 4:15:46| I believe we have sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15346)|
| 4:15:49| Not in my six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15349)|
| 4:15:51| There is a form, Mr. McKenzie, not to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15351)|
| 4:15:55| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15355)|
| 4:15:56| Commissioner Leval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15356)|
| 4:15:57| There was a form and an additional fee that I had to resubmit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15357)|
| 4:16:02| and repay to have the opportunity to come here tonight before you all to get it to be reappealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15362)|
| 4:16:08| or not reappealed, but appealed back to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15368)|
| 4:16:11| So that, in fact, there is a form in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15371)|
| 4:16:14| Yeah, but I'm thinking that's just for that packet that was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15374)|
| 4:16:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15377)|
| 4:16:18| And I'm looking at Mark now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15378)|
| 4:16:19| Is that something that you've?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15379)|
| 4:16:23| That's what we should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15383)|
| 4:16:24| Again, I just, you know, I know if we're on new ground, I just want to know that we're on new ground here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15384)|
| 4:16:30| and it not be, you know, this has been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15390)|
| 4:16:34| To answer what I can recall, I remember we did send one back to be reconsidered by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15394)|
| 4:16:41| I can remember one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15401)|
| 4:16:43| I don't know if we've done more than that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15403)|
| 4:16:45| Mark, do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15405)|
| 4:16:46| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15406)|
| 4:16:47| I can recall a case also in the East County where an applicant came in requesting commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15407)|
| 4:16:55| That was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15415)|
| 4:16:56| And during the discussion, there was mention of neighborhood commercial as an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15416)|
| 4:17:02| and looking at a broader area, multiple corners of an intersection instead of just one corner of an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15422)|
| 4:17:11| Yeah, I recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15433)|
| 4:17:15| In 1988, there was another case that came back before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15435)|
| 4:17:20| Well, we're talking about a little more recent than that, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15440)|
| 4:17:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15444)|
| 4:17:25| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15445)|
| 4:17:27| I think what we have, you know, we've sent stuff back to MPC before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15447)|
| 4:17:30| Mr. Norman had the gentleman from Sood Properties, you know, we sent that back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15450)|
| 4:17:36| All they're wanting to do, all the applicant's wanting to do is to work on his packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15456)|
| 4:17:42| It's nothing more than a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15462)|
| 4:17:45| And if he gets denied by MPC and he's hit a brick wall, he won't be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15465)|
| 4:17:51| He's just asking for a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15471)|
| 4:17:55| If he can find a palatable reason to rezone it, then they rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15475)|
| 4:17:58| If they don't, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15478)|
| 4:18:00| We're just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15480)|
| 4:18:01| It's nothing more than a deferral of time and referring them back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15481)|
| 4:18:07| As Mr. Jarrett has already said, it would be good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15487)|
| 4:18:11| And so that's all we're asking for is him the opportunity to resubmit to MPC and to speak with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15491)|
| 4:18:18| I was looking at this from practicalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15498)|
| 4:18:22| Obviously, you know, there has been a change in state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15502)|
| 4:18:25| We discussed that several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15505)|
| 4:18:27| So it's not like you're out of the sector plan business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15507)|
| 4:18:29| It just sounds like this particular issue appears unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15509)|
| 4:18:33| So I was just trying to give the commission some basically leeway to make a decision rather than a definitive decision that's going to just put us in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15513)|
| 4:18:42| But, again, I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15522)|
| 4:18:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15525)|
| 4:18:46| A point of order in that regard, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15526)|
| 4:18:49| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15529)|
| 4:18:50| A point of order in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15530)|
| 4:18:53| I trust you agree with my legal reasoning here that if MPC does not initiate a sector plan change and we choose to not initiate a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15533)|
| 4:19:05| then no one could possibly be in violation of the Fancler order because no one has initiated a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15545)|
| 4:19:12| Yeah, that's a logical analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15552)|
| 4:19:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15553)|
| 4:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15554)|
| 4:19:15| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15555)|
| 4:19:17| I guess my question is in the neighborhood, I don't know how many people signed a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15557)|
| 4:19:22| I don't know if Chris is going to go back into the neighborhood and talk to these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15562)|
| 4:19:26| If he gets a chance to go to MPC, I think it's important to make communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15566)|
| 4:19:30| Then if they don't accept anything that you want to do to that piece of property, then once MPC turns you down again, we won't see you up here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15570)|
| 4:19:38| Not on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15578)|
| 4:19:39| So I think if you go back and talk to the neighbors and see if there's anything you can do to satisfy them, that may not be a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15579)|
| 4:19:44| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15584)|
| 4:19:45| That's between you and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15585)|
| 4:19:46| But I think it's only fair to see if we can send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15586)|
| 4:19:49| If you get turned down, you're going to lose another $600, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15589)|
| 4:19:55| Just out of curiosity, haven't we been turned down twice, so this will be like the third buy at the Apple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15595)|
| 4:20:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15600)|
| 4:20:01| We're going to go on to Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15601)|
| 4:20:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15603)|
| 4:20:04| Mark, do you not have the ruling that things can't be bought back to you for a year unless they're changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15604)|
| 4:20:12| Well, by your body referring it back to us, that would essentially keep it alive until there's some finality to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15612)|
| 4:20:22| Well, now, what kind of changes did Mr. Edders make in it just the last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15622)|
| 4:20:30| He waited more than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15630)|
| 4:20:32| But he didn't make any changes at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15632)|
| 4:20:34| I don't believe there were any changes from that request, which was in June of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15634)|
| 4:20:40| Apparently he didn't have any interest in talking to the neighbors then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15640)|
| 4:20:45| Well, we're not getting away from this issue because we can send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15645)|
| 4:20:54| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15654)|
| 4:20:55| But he can still come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15655)|
| 4:20:57| I'm sorry, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15657)|
| 4:20:58| I hate to have to do this, but I'm going to ask Commissioner Lambert to please take his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15658)|
| 4:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15662)|
| 4:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15663)|
| 4:21:04| But this could still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15664)|
| 4:21:05| If you'll just hold on just a moment, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15665)|
| 4:21:07| Commissioner Lambert, I am asking you to please take your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15667)|
| 4:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15674)|
| 4:21:15| I'm sorry, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15675)|
| 4:21:16| Please go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15676)|
| 4:21:17| If we send this back, you correct me on this, Mark, and you too, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15677)|
| 4:21:24| if we send this back to MPC and they approve it, it still could come back before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15684)|
| 4:21:30| because these people that are against it have the right to appeal too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15690)|
| 4:21:33| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15693)|
| 4:21:36| To county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15696)|
| 4:21:38| If the request goes back to MPC and MPC were to approve the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15698)|
| 4:21:44| the plan amendment is not final until the county commission also approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15704)|
| 4:21:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15710)|
| 4:21:51| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15711)|
| 4:21:55| Well, so we're really just putting this issue off for a month is what it amounts to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15715)|
| 4:22:01| It still won't be back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15721)|
| 4:22:05| I don't understand why Mr. Edders did not change his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15725)|
| 4:22:10| Now, he said he had talked to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15730)|
| 4:22:14| Did you not say you had been talking to Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15734)|
| 4:22:18| I spoke with him one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15738)|
| 4:22:20| I spoke with his staff several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15740)|
| 4:22:23| I waited one year to get to this opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15743)|
| 4:22:25| I mean, have you talked to him since it was denied this last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15745)|
| 4:22:33| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15753)|
| 4:22:34| You said you had talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15754)|
| 4:22:36| and I just wanted to know if you had talked to him about any changes or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15756)|
| 4:22:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15759)|
| 4:22:40| I spoke with his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15760)|
| 4:22:42| And to address that, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15762)|
| 4:22:45| You have spoken to his staff since you were denied this last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15765)|
| 4:22:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15768)|
| 4:22:49| Three different occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15769)|
| 4:22:50| What kind of changes did you talk to them about making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15770)|
| 4:22:52| Buffers, restrictive zoning, zoning with restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15772)|
| 4:23:00| which has been done on several other occasions that they showed me in cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15780)|
| 4:23:05| And with no disrespect to the commissioners, Mr. Ivan Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15785)|
| 4:23:09| I said that I would not be back before your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15789)|
| 4:23:12| But, in fact, if the NPC found me in good standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15792)|
| 4:23:17| and sent me back before for a final decision from this commission to agree with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15797)|
| 4:23:24| yes, I would be back before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15804)|
| 4:23:27| But if I go back to the NPC and they find me not eligible for any of this zoning that I'm appealing for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15807)|
| 4:23:36| then I won't bring it back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15816)|
| 4:23:39| That's where I stand, and that's what I would like to be on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15819)|
| 4:23:44| Mark, when you're denied and you come before county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15824)|
| 4:23:52| he still has one other avenue to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15832)|
| 4:23:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15834)|
| 4:23:58| An applicant always has that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15838)|
| 4:24:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15840)|
| 4:24:01| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15841)|
| 4:24:02| So I think that probably we need to vote on this one where the other needs to prove or turn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15842)|
| 4:24:06| because either way it's going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15846)|
| 4:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15851)|
| 4:24:12| We have a motion on the floor to send both the sector plan and the zoning back to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15852)|
| 4:24:19| Clerk, let's call the roll starting in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15859)|
| 4:24:26| Commissioner Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15866)|
| 4:24:29| Commissioner Pinkston votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15869)|
| 4:24:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15871)|
| 4:24:33| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=15873)|

| 4:27:11| I just wanted to make an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16031)|
| 4:27:14| I think all of us are aware of the Love Kitchen and what it does to provide to the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16034)|
| 4:27:20| And they're in some need of some support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16040)|
| 4:27:24| And I have turned in all the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16044)|
| 4:27:26| And so if there are any commissioners, there's two different times in December that they're going to be trying to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16046)|
| 4:27:32| some money to keep their kitchen up and going for the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16052)|
| 4:27:36| So if anybody would like to be involved and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16056)|
| 4:27:40| Jolie, if people, if commissioners wish to use some of their discretionary funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16060)|
| 4:27:44| how soon do they need to get a hold of you for this particular matter so we don't have to do it again next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16064)|
| 4:27:52| Well, it will have to be next month because the one for this month has already gone in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16072)|
| 4:27:56| The items need to be in the commission office by the agenda item due date in order to be taken care of for that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16076)|

| 4:29:10| So I stayed on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16150)|
| 4:29:13| We're in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16153)|

| 4:29:22| If there are people from finance who would also like to serve on the committee, just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16162)|
| 4:29:28| But the people that signed up for that last month on the intergovernmental will be considered to be on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom091116?start=16168)|
